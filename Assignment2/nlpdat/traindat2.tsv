0 306 lunar landing plates year released: 1979 piece count: 2 minifigs: 0 list price: unknown as part of the classic space collection, lego offered two sets of moon plates. one was a set of two crater plates, and the other, this very useful landing plate set. not much to review, but worth sharing a few images: the landing plate: and t-plate: the two plates connect to form this very nice classic space landing platform: set 497, galaxy explorer included the landing platform, but the one that i had was lighter in color than the one contained in this set (at least the yellow circle). future lego space sets could benefit by having similar road plates. share your thoughts.

1 these are my only space base plates from classic space. actually, with only 2 plates, i could not do much serious expansion with it. instead, i merged it with my old city baseplates, and used it as a docking station for scientific purposes or restricted facilities that is guarded by the police. these baseplates are very useful and is suited for creating a space command center, up in the space.

-1 these are pretty good, but i think they look too much like the standard town roads from that period. i like the black space plates from the early 90s better (6710).

1 these plates are great in setting up your space base and giving your ships a place to land. my favorite, though, is the lunar crater plate, which i use to death in my comic. :)

-1 why pay $350 dollars, just download the instructions on buy the pieces off bricklink. this is was i did when i wanted to create the blacktron ii in the futuron colour scheme. also i tend to like both sets of base plates, i bought the black ones myself and they were of great use but there more for creating the idea of a city or space station, something more completely man made. the gray ones give a better look of the roads being laid over bare rock especially when you introduce the plates with the craters. i would love to see a 48*48 baseplate with roads through them which would allow more building space on the side and maybe some craters. also 48*48 baseplates with craters but a few different kinds to create more or a realistic look and less of a repeating pattern. and with all those rocks you have to put everything up on supports, much better looking bases then.

0 i also love these plates! i build a lot with them (e.g. this ). unfortunately they are not available in bley ...

-1 year released: 1976 piece count: 53 minifigs: 2 lego brought out floating boats quite early, and in many ways the first were the best. (i'll explain why later...) this set in particular is interesting as it came out in two versions; one that includes the first minifigs and another that included the non-armless type. (set 709.) the police signs are stickers, and are in surprisingly good condition considering the age of the set. (i am missing one sticker on the front though.) note the technic bush and axel; they are the old type. the position of the second figure is not a mistake; i think he's supposed to be sitting down.... the first boats out by lego needed a weighted keel to prevent them.... keeling over. (i have tested this!) i suspect this is because of the density of the old hulls and the flat bottom... but i could be wrong. (it can't be just because of the flat bottom as the new cargo ship doesn't need one.) the keel in detail. the bottom extension is for a motor. (not included, nor made by lego at the time.) the keel had longer studs. even now it holds extra firmly. this is why i prefer the old design. you can extend or shorten the hulls as you please, or even insert other lego in the middle. you can easily add wheels or any other piece to the bottom of these hulls. i wish they would go back to this idea; the 4+ hulls were of this concept but were too wide. (probably so the keel wasn't needed.) the old minifigs aside from having odd feet and no arms had a normal stud as the neck. thus when you turn the head it tends to come off. i love this set!

0 thebrickster, on jun 22 2008, 01:41 am, said: it looks like your boat is in really good shape considering it's >30 years old. excellent review! i know; i got it for a song on ebay. most 1970s sets don't seem to be in much demand...

-1 thank you for the nice review, sinner. holodoc, on aug 1 2008, 08:59 am, said: nice review sinner! the old sets... i dont know - every old set, especially equipped with the old non-moveable arms minifigs look very odd nowadays. i agree with you with the hull shape and its possibility to be extended, but every other aspect, the lack of detail, the keel itself (you cant float it in shallow water) keeps me from rating it higher than 3/10. in my opninion the best police boat so far is 4021 *click to enlarge* well, if you're meaning really old sets, than i agree with you, but a lot of the sets from the very late 1970s and onwards are still very nice. this set just isn't a good example, that's all. oh, and i also agree with you about that police boat. however, the newer one in the city line is also great, imo. the only thing that weighs against it is the giant size, which makes it feel awkward in more classic towns. edited by grevious, 03 august 2008 - 06:30 pm.

-1 lol! i can't help but smile everytime i see the quote on this thread..... don't worry these police are armless! lol

1 well what to say? i got this boat late 70s, when we were on our way to italy to spend the holidays there. my parents always needed to keep my quiet during the 3-day trip, and the best way to do that was to buy me a lego set... i got this one in a gas station in germany. as far as i remember italy didn't have lego sets, so a gas station close to the italian border but still in germany or austria was very often their last chance. i often saw large quantities of lego sets in those gas stations though... i remember seeing yellow castle and... the galaxy explorer, standing on a shelf. it would be my birthday 1-3 week(s) later so i always made sure they knew what to buy for me...

1 nice review, 'mariko'! this set is way past my time. the baseplate is okay (though i hate those dots). the car is pretty cool too...

0 way before my time, too--in fact, this set came out twenty years before i was born! the baseplate doesn't actually have dots--i'm not sure if they were there once, and then rubbed off (a possibility, as the studs are rather smoother than i imagine they once were), or if this particular one didn't have the dots. this set also shows that the difficulty lego has in doing vehicle scale isn't new. the house is the perfect size for microfigures from the lego games; however, the car is massive--over twice as tall as a microfig!

1 great review mariko! this set is way before my time too. i like how lego used to create simple one story houses instead of the really tall house that we see in today's town theme, such as 8403 city house. one story houses such as 345 just look more realistic to my eyes. the simplistic, minimalism vibe that i get with this set is something that is hard to find in today's much more detailed sets (although, trust me, i love love love today's detailed sets). - the brick is epic

1 image link from brickset i thought i would do a pic review of the 1st lego castle, the yellow castle, #375- released in 1978. first, let me say that this set was truly "ahead of it's time". it introduced new building concepts (such as the hinge and new figs (most were still the armless, faceless mini-figs during this time). this set introduced me to castle which was my first real favorite theme. i enjoyed breaking it out from the garage and building it again. the majority of the pieces are 1x1, 1x2, 1x3, 1x4, 1x6, and 1x8 standard yellow bricks. the set also includes yellow 1x4, 1x6x2, and 1x8x2 arches, yellow 2x2, 2x3, and 2x4 bricks, various grey plates, 1x2 black inverted slopes, red drawbridge pieces, two classic red castle doors, 8 hinges (2 for each corner), and a few other nifty pieces including six red 1x1 windows. a complete inventory is available at peeron: 375 inventory. a view from the front. the drawbridge is 6x8. the front tower stands 12 1/3 bricks high (plenty of room for horses). the drawbridge does work. the string (originally black) is attached to the opposite side between a plate and the arches. the right side of the castle (identical to the left). i've always loved the 2x2x3 sloped bricks (and corner pieces): the back. i love these red doors. a 1x4 brick attached to the other side of the baseplate keeps intruders out. that banner was the original sticker piece. notice the wear. the rear tower, largest of the towers: and backside: two hinges at each of the corners allow the corners to open for playability: before opening: open: lots of arches add to the detail of the inner walls: inner front: this set included 14 figs (how about that for quantity). unfortunately, i peeled off worn stickers from the shields and the breast plates years ago. the blue castle guards and knights are the keepers of the castle. i still think that these helmets are the best lego ever made. they just look good. the black and white knights: and the red knights: i've always prefered to use the black and red guards and flags from the knight's joust set(s): conclusion the yellow castle is truly a classic set and i'm so glad i kept the pieces to this together after all these years. if you have a chance to buy one or even obtain the set instructions, it's worth building and wouldn't be difficult to substitute grey or other colors. i hope you enjoyed this review and feel free to share your comments.

1 great review. it is nice to see an in-depth photo review of this set. i especially love the last picture of your old city! it certainly does bring back memories...

1 yup that is very very nice..i wish i had been alive back then :d well ill never have a chance to own something like this so this is as close ill get to it! thanks for showing me the greatness....

1 kimt, on dec 28 2005, 02:52 pm, said: toothbrush and mild soap - and lots of time gently scrubbing a cleaning. and great review - i love that set *wub* *wub* i'm sorry that you seem to miss the stickers - if you find somewhere to download printable copies of them please let me know *satis* kimt thanks for the tip. i tried it on a few pieces and they look much better. unfortunately, it does take a lot of time. i need a lego cleaning machine with this many pieces.

0 imperialjohn, on dec 29 2005, 05:11 pm, said: i've tried this once. remember? normal white sticker sheet in an ink jet and the transparent plastic on top !! p.s. the one on the right is the homemade one!! so you're using two layers (stickers) doesn't that make it very thick?

0 here's a shot of a custom forestman. these really work well: i'm using just regular sticker paper. how do you stick transparent plastic on top?

0 i guess it's easiest to put the entire shield on a transparent sticker and cut the edges. i would also do that with the white stickers, because now you can still see the gray edges of the shield. perhaps you can make a bigger black, or brown in the other case, outline. you also wouldn't be able to see if the sticker is exactly in the middle...

0 quote so you're using two layers (stickers) doesn't that make it very thick? not really. i think it works out very fine. 1. print out the image. 2. put on the plastic. 3. cut out the image. 4. apply on the part.

1 theme: hobby sets set name: harley-davidson 1000cc set number: 394 price (new): 260-280 $, 185-200 euro price (used): 14-175 $, 10-125 euro pieces: 143 year of release: 1976 links: peeron, bricklink and brickset looking at the release date of this set makes me remember the good old times when lego sets stayed in production and could be found in stores for long years. yes, i hear you younger fols say this meant we had less variety at the time, but at least we did not have to go on a frenzy to get them all in just 1 or 2 years before they disappeared (to re-appear on the secondary market at crazy prices). anyway, i also realise this set is older than me by 5 years (at least the first boxes of this set). i think my parents bought it when i was something like 1/2 year old, or even before, as my father really liked the hobby set line and took any chance to get one, you know, for the kids, when theyll be old enough to play with them i am really happy my father did it, too. as a matter of fact, this has always been one of my favourite non-minifigure scale sets. i know younger eyes will look on it and wonder how we could love and enjoy a model like this, so blocky and rough. just remember this was the best tlg designers could do with the bricks available at the time. enough about memories; lets start with the review! the box front the front of the box (here cut and folded to save space) shows the harley davidson 1000cc in all its glory upon a nice town landscape. i really appreciate how tlg box designers used a real life photo of the model in a real life environment to give this hobby set a better background. moreover, the landscape does not distract the eye, even with its lights, since the focus is strongly set on the motorbike itself. back (and sides) the back of the box shows the model on a more neutral background and from another angle. we can see the stickers in place (take a good look at them here, because i did not apply them). the right side we also see a pic of the set from the front, and one with a child playing with it. in this latter shot, the model rests upon a nice black box with a harley davidson sign on it. i frankly do not remember if this was some sort of tray or smaller box within the lego one or if it is meant for publicity only. another thing we can notice on the right-most side of the box is a white band, right below the lego logo, sporting the sign designed for experienced lego builders in various languages. all in all, a really well done and professional job. contents inside this set includes a number of parts in mainly black, white and light grey. some blue and yellow add nice touches of colour to the total. the parts selection is not mind-blowing, as most of the pieces had been in production, in these same colours for years. anyway, id like to focus on a couple of details: the milky white technic axles as well as the red technic bush old 2 are among my favourite parts. the bushes, in particular, are quite useful to build more sturdy looking tubes than what can be achieved with the newer and slimmer ones. it would seem that the tile pieces appeared in the without grove version as a standard and in the with grove version as alternates (see bricklink inventory). notice, though that the box (above) and instructions (below) pictures all show the with grove variety. as said, there are no re-coloured parts in this set. new pieces the few new molds used in this set are: black and white slope, inverted 45 2 x 2 old type with round bottom tube, black technic, brick 1 x 2 with hole type ii and red hinge plate 2 x 4 with articulated joint  male and female. the most interesting piece from this lot, as many of you will have noticed is the technic, brick 1 x 2 with hole type ii. this kind of technic brick was use during 1976 and 1977 only. it would seem tlg tried a new design variant, which did not meet success and was later replaced with the standard bricks again. nonetheless, im sure that people who own these bricks like them for the unusual design and the possibilities they offer into adding details to their creations. instructions cover  as usual, the instructions are not organised in the form of a booklet, but they consist of a folded double printed sheet. the cover shows again the same shot as the front of the box, with bigger lego logo and set number and without the other additional information. back cover  here we see the full name of the set: harley-davidson flh 1200. this makes me wonder: why is this set known as 394 harley davidson 1000cc when it is indeed a 1200cc? anyway, what really makes me love this page is the list of stats below the photo, and in particular these two lines: h.p. (?)/(not given). this calls for just one question: why did harley-davidson not release this info? my opinion is that since this is a motorbike built for the police, they did not have permission to share the specifications on the motor, which was probably customised either by harley-davidson upon request or by the police themselves. random page  as expected, no call-outs here, but the build is pretty straight forward and does not need them (apart for one passage well see later). the colours are easy to tell apart (in the end there is no dark grey in this set that could be confused with black). again, notice how the instructions include the with grove tiles and not the older ones. maybe this was changed during the long time this set stayed in production? the last page shows other four models included in the hobby set line. unfortunately, i own only one of them: the 396 thatcher perkins locomotive. indeed, i would have liked to have them all! building start the handle bars look a bit too squared to me, but its just a minor feature, and the overall shape is still good in my opinion. notice the red hinge plate, which will be almost totally hidden in the finished model (see below), and the blue tiles which work as indicators. the first steps, used to build the front wheel and windshield are really easy, until you get to the wheel. in facts, the instructions do not show clearly all the pieces needed for it, and i found myself with a floating wheel for the absence of one of the red technic bush old 2 on one side (the one not visible on the instructions, of course). not a big deal, but something that could have been done better. motor and seat the second part of the build includes the motor, seat and saddle bags. the technique used for the motor, or better the radiator, is very clever. to get the ridged feel, tlg designers used 4 light grey plates stuck one on the other but not completely in contact. this way, the studs, while keeping the plates in position, keep them raised from one another at the same time. the yellow round bricks add some details and colour touches to this predominantly light grey parts of the vehicle. the use of the engine, smooth small, 1 x 2 side plates for the exhaust pipes, while quite clever, still looks a bit strange to me. im mostly used to see them in airplanes, helicopters and spaceships. saddle-bags, a simple build for one of the iconic parts of this motorcycle. here you see them in place, as well as get a look at the finished seat. i like how lego designers managed to make its shape with just a few quite big bricks. the saddle bags are a really nice touch, and they work perfectly when compared to the original. this is the rear wheel. as said before, only when you get to this passage in the instruction you get a real understanding of how the front wheel is supposed to be mounted as well. careful readers will notice how this is not one of the original wheels in this set. the original ones were mounted using the technic, gear expert builder 9 tooth. unfortunately, i could only find one of them in my collection, an its used as the front wheel. by adding the rear wheel (which is shown from a better angle in the instructions), we complete the model. notice how the two technic bricks supporting the wheel are held in position by two 2x1 plates. i think this was a bad case of building by compartments mentality: if tlg designers had considered this a bit more, they would have used 2 4x1 plates instead of 4 2x1. on the other hand, this is not the worst case i have seen in a lego set, and they keep up the tradition nowadays too. finished set front and here it is our fancy police harley-davidson! indeed, the front looks blocky and quite horrible to our eyes, but again, it was almost the best that could be done at the time. i only wish they had made it a little less bulky, even though this build is clearly thought to give better stability to the wheel. the blue tiles work nicely to emphasise the indicators, the slightly unsightly red plate is normally covered by the plate sticker and the windshield, albeit being hard to see through, is nicely shaped. back the back side is less detailed than the front, but shows the red light and antenna which are typical of the police motorbikes from this period. how many times have we seen this angle in the chase scenes from tv shows like chips? side all in all, this model looks pretty sturdy (apart for the antenna, which falls off all too easily) and detailed, especially considering the limited variety of parts available and used at the time. they even got so far to put a 2x2 tile as kick-stand to display it without fear of it falling on the sides! bonus images size comparison? what i never understood about this set is what scale it is meant to be. i mean, it is clearly not minifig-scale, and it could not be technic-fig-scale (those came later). but it is not even miniland scale! moreover, the only other model with the same scale is the other hobby set motorbike, as the cars have a scale of their own and the thatcher uses still another one! final comments overall, this is a great set for collectors of old models and motorbike fans, or both. it does not sport a huge variety of bricks, but was a good choice at the time, and even if the result is matter-of-fact blocky when compared to the original, it implements some good solutions to minimise the lego brick appearance and maximise the similarity as much as possible. design & colour scheme  9/10 (the design is as accurate as possible, apart for the front mudguard maybe, and the colours are completely in line for a police vehicle. the solutions and details included in this set justify the expert builders label and add to the appearance, and, why not, playability of the model.) parts - 8/10 (not a huge selection, and very few new molds. nonetheless, a good source of black and white standard parts for mocs and one of the few sources for the extra rare technic, brick 1 x 2 with hole type ii pieces.) playability - 9/10 (a sturdy model which can take some serious play and swoosh-ing without falling apart. the easily detachable antenna and the lack of an appropriate scale interaction with most other models make it lose one point, though.) build - 7/10 (pretty straight forward, with few nice solutions and an already mentioned slightly obscure passage in the instructions.) price - 5/10 (like most older models, especially the hobby set and model team ones, this set can be found at reasonable prices only rarely. most of the times, people are asked shameful prices for such a smallish set.) overall: 8/10 very good. as always, questions, comments, and pic requests welcome! edited by whitefang, 17 april 2011 - 06:19 pm. indexed

1 great job on this review of a unique and rare set luxorv! considering the year it was released, this must have been a cool set back then. even up to now with all the specialized pieces and advanced building techniques, i could still appreciate the beauty of this brickbuilt harley-davidson police motorbike. the various elements are instantly recognizable and it even has the unusual 'partly-stacked' plates technique for the motor. overall, i'd say this is an above average set that is a must-have for any hardcore lego collector.

1 great review! the set is really nice, i love that the front of the motercycle can turn and the engine is just beautiful, with its half stacked bricks like kieldaman said. the price used or new is quite a bit, but there is a good variety of bricks here like the bricks inside the wheels. did you get this set from your father? great review luxorv!

1 luxorv this is an awesome review. the classic-ness of this set is just lovely. it's so easy to just fall in love with this set. you're review is outstanding as well, the pictures are so clear and the review is just solid. you've really polished your reviewing skills

1 wow, talk about illegal connections, eh? great review. i really like this set, even for its age

1 thanks for the feedback guys! indeed this is a great set, and i'm very attached to it. as far as i remember, i got it for say my 2nd birthday, i think but it is not my first lego set. you'll learn more on this in my next planned review

1 luxorv, this is a well written presentation on this lego vintage review. i never knew the existence of this set and even though the design is not part of the modern lego design concept but the overall appeal back in the 1970s certainly appeal to many. i could not mind to own such vintage lego model and put them on display and potray as if it was a chart of evolution of lego motorbikes. thanks for sharing and i can't wait to find out your next review.

1 thanks 'luxorv' for this review of such a classic old lego set and i do remember seeing these in a catalogue years ago. excellent brick-built police cycle, i think it's time lego did another one eh ? brick on ride on everyone !

1 great review for a classic model. i love it.

when i grew up, at first i found it to be quite boring: no minifigures, limited play features; in the end, it was just a locomotive! it soon went to forgotten-land. then, when i was about 10 years old, i one day found again the instructions booklet and saw this bright coloured big steam engine, and i suddenly wanted to build it again. it would seem i finally got to the right age (at least for me) to appreciate the design of this great set. but enough about memories; lets start with the review! the box front the front of the box (here cut and folded to save space) shows the thatcher perkins locomotive in all its glory upon a nice countryside landscape. i really appreciate how tlg box designers used a real life environment made of sand, gravel and pebbles to give this hobby set a better background. moreover, the landscape does not distract the eye, since the focus is strongly set on the locomotive itself. the box measures about 39.5 x 24.5 x 5.5 centimetres, or 15.56 x 9.65 x 2.17 inches. this is more or less the size of the 4840 - the burrow, or the advent calendars. back (and sides) the back of the box shows the model on a more neutral background and from another angle. we can see the stickers in place (take a good look at them here, because i did not apply them). the right side we also see a pic of the set from the (3/4) back, and one with a child playing with it. in this latter shot, the model rests upon a nice black box with a thatcher perkins sign on it. unlike the harley davidson 1000cc set, the thatcher perkins does not have the sign designed for experienced lego builders for some reason. contents inside this set includes a large number of parts, mainly black, blue and red, with some nice yellow to lighten it up more. parts of interest the parts selection is not exceptional, but well see this set includes some unique pieces which have not been in lego sets for long years since the 1980s, like the very nice black plate, modified 1 x 2 with steam engine cylinder, flat surfaces, black train wheel spoked for motor and the red train steam drive rod holder - train steam drive rod group. the wheel spoked large, as beautiful as they were, saw the light from the production line for the last time in 1976! the only new mold used in this set is the black and blue slope, inverted 45 2 x 2 old type with round bottom tube. as you can see in the above picture, this locomotive was designed to work (well, be played with) on all kind of surfaces, so the wheels sport tyres. in this picture you can see how they look without the tyres. of course, builders can use the thatcher perkins on their brick-built tracks. another group of interesting parts are shown in this pic: red wheel spoked 2 x 2 with stud (and tyre), black brick, modified 2 x 4 with wheels holder old, clear bottom and yellow minifig, head (plain) - stud solid. many newer fans will not be familiar with the last two parts: they were standard fare in a number of sets between the 1960s and early 1990s, but then (unfortunately) they were taken out of production. to be fair, the replacement of the black brick, modified 2 x 4 with wheels holder old, clear bottom with the standard technic parts was probably due to the fact that the metal pin used to connect the wheels to these bricks had a shameful tendency at getting off the wheel. too bad it could not be fixed and these parts kept in production. for those interested, here is a picture of the dss, courtesy of peeron. instructions cover  as usual, the instructions are not organised in the form of a booklet, but they consist of a folded double printed sheet. the cover shows again the same shot as the front of the box. back cover  here we see the name of the set and some additional information, like the year when the first thatcher perkins started working (1863) and the type (4-6-0) of this locomotive, which, as shown in the image, is related to the number and position of the wheels. on a side note, the pencil signs on the sides of the sheet were made by my father while counting the parts in the set. random page  as expected, no call-outs here, but the build is pretty straight forward and does not need them. the colours are easy to tell apart. full page  as you may have noticed, all the building steps are drawn on one side of the booklet, making it more properly an instructions sheet. what really makes this instruction booklet stand out in my eyes is the fact that it is indeed a poster: the building steps are all on one side, while the other is a bigger image of the completed set with the name thatcher perkins in yellow enclosed in an old styled red tag. building start the build starts with the base of the locomotive, putting the 10 wheels in place and strengthening the engine. notice the use of this illegal technique to build the bumpers. lego, as we all know can be a tricky medium to build with, and some details need special solutions to be completed. we then start building the boiler and cabin. going up fast and steady! in the penultimate step, we build the chimney and cow catcher. id like to spend a few more words on the chimney and how it is attached to the main body. as you can see in the left picture, the 3x3 base of the chimney is asymmetrical, with a 3x2 base on one side and a combination of a 1x2 and a 1x1 plates on the other. in the right picture, you see the top of the main body where the chimney will be attached; it is made of a 1x2 base and 1 1x2 tile. using another illegal technique (or at least one lego designers do not like much nowadays), the holes of the 3x2 plate of the chimney will connect with the studs of the 1x2 plate on the main body, giving a well centred and quite sturdy build. finished set front the front of the model sports 3 big headlights, a nice cow catcher and the nicely detailed engine front. i can almost hear it whistle! side and here it is our good old thatcher perkins locomotive! indeed, it looks like a classic and powerful engine form one of those spaghetti western films, doesnt it? what i found strange in the beginning is the choice of colours (i was convinced steam engines were all black, at the time). then i checked some pictures of the original, and i must admit the resemblance is almost perfect! back the back side is less detailed than the front, with cabin almost devoid of details. i think lego could have done a better job on it. 3/4 front and  just see how good it looks from this angle, with all the tubing, moving parts and the lovely 3 headlights!  3/4 back the back view is not as impressive, but grants us a good look at the big posterior wheels and the bumpers. bonus images size comparison? as i stated elsewhere, i never understood what scale these hobby sets are meant to be. they are clearly not minifig-scale, and they are not technic-fig-scale either. but they are not even miniland scale! moreover, they use different scales between locomotives, cars and motorbikes amongst the hobby set line! as i said before, the set comes with tyres on the wheels to allow a wider playing experience, not limiting this model to tracks. nonetheless, builders can assemble their own track (maybe using the vintage blue 4.5v tracks) and make the thatcher perkins run its proper environment. final comments overall, this is a great set for collectors of old models and steam engines fans, or both. it does not sport a huge variety of bricks, but was a good choice at the time, and even if the result is matter-of-fact a bit blocky when compared to the original, it implements some good solutions to minimise the lego brick appearance and maximise the similarity as much as possible. design & colour scheme  8/10 (the design is as accurate as possible, and the colours are completely in line for the thatcher perkins locomotive. the solutions and details included in this set justify the expert builders label and add to the appearance, and, why not, playability of the model. though, i still wish tlg had included more details in the cabin.) parts - 10/10 (quite a big selection, but only one new mould. nonetheless, a good source of black, blue and red standard parts for mocs and one of the few sources for the extra rare black plate, modified 1 x 2 with steam engine cylinder, flat surfaces, black train wheel spoked for motor, red train steam drive rod holder - train steam drive rod group and wheel spoked large.) playability - 9/10 (a sturdy model which can take some serious play and swoosh-ing without falling apart. the somewhat easily detachable chimney and the lack of an appropriate scale interaction with most other models make it lose one point, though.) build - 7/10 (pretty straight forward, with few nice solutions.) price - 5/10 (like most older models, especially the hobby set and model team ones, this set can only rarely be found at reasonable prices. most of the times, people are asked shameful prices for such a smallish set.) overall: 8/10 very good. more pictures can be found in this brickshelf gallery. as always, questions, comments, and pic requests welcome!

1 thanks for the review 'luxorv', an interesting old set, though i find it hard to imagine a square smoke stack instead of roundish. it truly has that classic lego simplistic build with all studs showing and making do with standard partsm except the few you havepointed out 'luxorv'. a nice flashback 35 years ago....now thats old school anyway brick on everyone !

1 thanks, luxor, for bringing us this excellent tour round an old classic! for its time, this is truly a remarkably detailed and beautiful set, and i think it's amazing how it's still in such good condition after all this time. do you have any more from this era (excepting the harley, of course )? i've created a whole new index to put them in

1 indexed 410  payloader theme: legoland/vehicle piece count: 28 year released: 1973 msrp: ??? links: brickset, lugnet, peeron, bricklink *note: this set was released under the number 604 outside of the u.s.* ah, classic legoland. a time before mini-figs ever existed, and cars and buildings could be made with just a few bricks. the part selection was pretty basic: bricks, plates, slopes, windows and wheels were all you needed to construct an entire town. heavy machinery could be modeled in 4-wide and be just a few bricks tall. for this review we will be taking a look at the 410 payloader, one of legos first sets of a bucket loader. so grab a hard hat, we are heading to the construction yard! box image courtesy of bricklink. box contents here we have our instructions which are obviously the older style of lego instructions. the steps used much simpler imagery, but they get the job done. they show how to build the payloader in seven steps. this small set has all of 28 parts in it. the more interesting parts of note are the red digger arm, the bucket, the blue 1x2 brick with arm holes, and the blue 2x2 brick with the classic lego logo printed on it. construction in the first few steps we start building up the base. then add the arms and start building the cab. add the bucket, the trailer socket and finish the cab. throw on some wheels. completed set and with that we are finished with our nice small model. here is the back right side. notice how the back of the cab was left with an empty spot. here is the left side. notice how on the top of the arm they made it so you could just push down on the tips it to make the arm lift instead of having to grab by the arm itself. on the front we have the nice lego logo shown to remind the forgetful of what they were playing with. you can also see how much space is in the bucket itself, which can't hold more than a few small plates. finally on the back we have the trailer socket. this was a nice addition to make it able to tow trailers from other sets like 685. just dont try to bring it into your layout populated by mini-figs, they may have a problem trying to get in. other thoughts considering this set is nearly 37 years old, i myself am still surprised by how well the bricks have held up. i purchased this set from a thrift store a year ago for a mere 25 cents. normally when used lego is purchased you can expect to see scratches, marks, wearing, discoloration, etc but boy was i surprised to see how all these parts are in mint condition. even the instructions still looked like they came from a new box and not all ripped up and tattered. the pieces still connect to each other nice and tight and the metal pieces for the wheels haven't rusted. this just shows that with proper care these things can last a lifetime. i really would like to get a small display case to show it off. conclusion playability: 8/10 in addition to the standard of having rolling wheels, you also get a fully movable bucket assembly. with it you can pick up smaller pieces and unload them into a dump truck. design: 7/10 like all other legoland vehicles it has a very basic design, but you can still easily identify what it is. simple yet effective. parts: 7/10 like most other older lego sets, all you really get are a few basic bricks and plates. however, you do get a bucket assembly and the 2x2 brick with the classic lego logo on it is very cool. it was also nice of lego to include the trailer socket so you could tow around your trailers. price: 8/10 bricklink's history shows them to sell for around $10 usd used. while that is a bit much for a set this size, it is pretty good considering this set is over 37 years old. however, if you are looking for a new boxed set be prepared to fork over about $50 usd. overall: 8/10 this small machine would make a nice addition to your collection as a reminder of lego's past. so what are your thoughts on this classic set? edited by thebrickster, 01 june 2010 - 05:55 am.

1 thank you very much for this wonderful review! this is the oldest lego set in my collection. i received this model from my grand parents many years ago - i'm not exactly sure who in my family it used to belong to, but it has a home with me now. it's a very simple but attractive looking vehicle, and functions pretty well too. overall, very nice.

1 ah, the good old days........thanks for the review 'yoshi648' - cute and cool at the same time. it's interesting to see that the same front end parts had been used from the early 70's up in to the late 90's ! nice again to step back in time and keep on bricking everyone !

1 i voted 'outstanding.' regarding this set, i found mine at a consignment store. it was inside of a larger set from the same time period.

0 woah. 25 cents for a mint condition set! that's amazing.

0 well, it's not exactly a large shuttle, but still a nice set: 442 space shuttle year released: 1979 piece count: 79 minifigs: 1 vehicles: 0 list price: unknown this little classic was my smallest classic space set. believe it or not, i still have the box: here's the back: the instructions are pretty tattered and missing a section. i had to download some from the web: but the ship is again intact, missing only one grey 1x3 plate: i've always liked this computer piece: here's the under side. this set included the small classic jet engines: a close-up of the sloped printed space brick: and the complete set with minifig: this set was a great little space ship that made a nice addition to the blue space theme. as small as it was, it could hold two-three figs (one standing up). i don't even think the mars mission recon drop ship holds three figs. in any case, it was a must-have for blue space fans, and probably only a few bucks back in the day. swoosh!

1 it's simply amazing how far lego has come in 30 years.

1 and again those tears in my eyes. with original box...! i really love those classic space stuff. looks like i need to clean my stuff this summer.

1 this classic space shuttle is simply superb! i love the layout of this shuttle. in fact, it reminded me as one of the space fighter jet, that roam around in space, defending the boundaries from intruders. i just love these old grey bricks very much and the printed computer brick is just lovely. it's such a pity, that i did not grow up with classic space in my childhood. these are actually great stuff, and formed the base of the space theme in lego. brickster, thanks again for another outstanding classic review.

1 the computer is my favorite part. sadly, i dont own any classic space...exept for some space police, and a blue classic space man.

1 nice!!! 442 is the lowest set number i have seen for any classic space set, so it must been released with the first wave in 1978. its remarkable that a lego spaceship this old and small can seat more figs than the much bigger mx-71 recon dropship of today. anyway, i just want to grab it out of the screen and swoosh it all over the place, lol. tlg, please make these classic space sets again! i promise i'll buy many!

0 indexed everyone remembers their first time. for me, it was in 19*cough*somethingsomething*cough*. we were at her house, and her mother was gone for at least an hour. she slowly unzi... uhhh. sorry, wrong story. um, yeahh. anyway, i do remember my first time. it was 1977, in late summer. our neighbor, who worked for a department store called famous-bahr, said that the main store had a travelling lego display. so my family filed into the car and drove into downtown st louis to see this display. to tell you the truth, i don't remember much about the display itself, but i do remember that my parents bought me my first lego set. set # 456, the spirit of st louis. set #: 456 (also sold as set # 661) name: spirit of st louis theme: legoland / large vehicle year: 1977 pieces: 49 minifigs: 0 price: $5.00 usd? (bricklink misb start @ $175.00 usd, used complete ~$35.00 usd) links: peeron, bricklink, brickset packaging box front: the original box that my set came in was most likely trashed 5 minutes after returning home. this image was lovingly stolen off of the peeron page for this set. i feel lucky that i even got this much. similarly, i have no pictures of the plastic baggies the set came in. truth be told, i can't be sure that there even were plastic baggies that the parts came in. the set side view: well there she is. my first set ever . actually, i seem to recall the real spirit of st louis was silver colored, not black and yellow. if you need a history lesson, the spirit of st louis was charles lindbergh's plane when he made the first trans-atlantic solo flight. more details can be found on the wikipedia page. the overall shape is pretty close, at least. the cockpit window could stand to be moved forward one stud, but everything seems to be relatively close. the tail piece isn't the right shape, but it is likely the only tail piece lego produced at the time. if you look closely, you can see the various bite marks that my brother and i inflicted over the years. i know some people would be aghast that there are bite marks, but brick separators wouldn't come out for another 10 years. besides, we were young. we didn't know any better. i certainly had no idea that it would become my obsession. there are some interesting part choices here. everything is brick and plate built, as you might expect. the same set nowadays would have lots of slope, wedges and wedge plates to round things out. but lego was all about the brick in '77, so bricks are what we got. the black inverted slopes worked pretty well asthetically as the wing struts. the wings are simple 4 x 10 plates, nice and square. there were no minifigs in this set. if i remember correctly, 1977 was just about the time when minifigs made their first appearance. i know i have one other set from '77 that does include a minifg, at least. i don't have a lot of comments for the following photos. i'll let the pictures speak for themselves. 3/4 view back back 3/4 top front parts interesting pieces i have no idea if there were any extra pieces that came with this set. i kind of doubt it. instead i took a photo of some of the interesting parts to the model. that translucent white piece didn't photograph so well, but it is a technic axle 8. that's right, sets from 1977 contained technic elements. the two black parts are the forerunners to the 1 x 2 technic brick, as well. everytime i hear someone on the forums complain about technic elements in system sets, i think back to this set. the round brick is special as well. here is a closer view of it, complete with bite marks . round brick as you can see, the stud is closed. it is only one of two closed stud 1 x 1 round bricks that i own. they stopped appearing in sets in 1981, for those that are interested. the dss you thought you were going to escape this heading, didn't you? surprise! yes, even in 1977 lego sets had stickers. the oldest printed elements i can remember were in the classic space sets that started in 1979. again, when people in the forums complain about dss in sets, i can only help think of this set. and chuckle to myself maniacally. the sticker has held up really well considering it's been stuck on the brick for 32 years. no discoloration, very little curling. i think if all stickers held up this well over time, there would be less dss complaints. the ratings playability: 6/10 - the set is quite swooshable, and the propellor spins. outside of that, though... minifigs: n/a design: 6/10 - the overall shape is quite good, especially given the era. the color choice leaves a lot to be desired. price: 1/10 - it's been retired for 30 years. it's going to cost you to get your hands on it. overall: 13/30 - this set is for true collectors only. i can't imagine anyone wanting one because they want to play with it. it was a great set back in the day, but the design feels really dated. and if you're wondering, mine is not for sale. ever. all the photos, plus more, can be found in the gallery.

1 great job! i love reading vintage reviews, as it reminds of our childhood days. glad to see this in very good condition. by the way, i will move this to lego trains & town, to see if thebrickster will like to include this set inside the review index over there. i believe he is maintaining vintage town set reviews over there, and this suits there well.

0 great review, it's good to see some of the old sets reviewed. i think i learned something about the history of lego from this one.

0 fantastic review! id love to read more like this, trivia about old/rare pieces is almost as fun as the set itself.

1 outstanding review of a very special set! i actually remember seeing this set on the store shelves of local department stores. can you believe it? fantastic review walter. i really enjoy looking at these vintage sets. this one deserves a blog!

-1 in 1977, trans or yellow slopes existed already, and using them would have made the plane more realistic. a third rear wheel would have enhanced playability and design, rather than this ugly black round brick. it's the reason why i voted "below average" even considering 1977's standards. however this set is nice and simple, offering good playability.

1 here is the spirit of st louis. just go there (washington) and have a look of this legend : cavannus, on jul 15 2009, 09:40 pm, said: in 1977, trans or yellow slopes existed already, and using them would have made the plane more realistic. i don't think so. there is no 45 slope in the original plane design ... and no front cockpit window. quote a third rear wheel would have enhanced playability and design, rather than this ugly black round brick. except that it wouldn't have been the spirit of st louis. this set is a great one and i wish i'd bought it in '77. it is the spirit of the 70ties ...

1 i really like the design, it has an aesthetic value lacking from most official lego planes and follows closely to the real thing (minus the colours), something that can't really be claimed for more recent sets.

1 483 alpha-1 rocket base year released: 1979 piece count: 170 minifigs: 3 vehicles: 1 (two sections) list price: unknown despite the nuclear non-proliferation treaty of 1968, lego dared design a rocket base complete with a rocket system that may have had nuclear capability in 1979. luckily, the rocket was defective having rather flimsy white bricks that did not stay together well during launch attempts. lego scrapped its wmd program and the result was this classic "blue era" space set known as the alpha-1 rocket base. instructions: on the backside of the instructions, the set is featured with the space command center, space cruiser, and a few vehicle sets: the set includes three figs: and this great rocket fuel tanker: here's the front section complete with computer: and the rocket fuel section: the set has some interesting features including the control section, fuel control, and launch pad: on top of the control section is a nicely design radar/tracking system: here's the open control room: the launch pad and fuel control: the fuel control includes two sink pieces and blue steering wheels: and lego's wmd (weapon of mass destruction), the alpha-1 on the launch pad: here's a shot of the launching mechanism: unfortunately, i have lost one of the blue sink/faucet pieces as well as a black hose: a close-up of the alpha-1 rocket. the white bricks never stayed together well often times coming apart within your hands: the arming and guidance system was nicely designed: a view of the complete set: and another: this is a great set. the base, fuel vehicle, and launch platform offers a great amount of playability. my only complaint is the rocket (as mentioned above). i don't think i ever played with it a sa kid because it always fell apart. share your comments regarding this classic space set.

0 thebrickster, on jul 4 2008, 04:14 am, said: a close-up of the alpha-1 rocket. the white bricks never stayed together well often times coming apart within your hands: huh, did they not think of putting a technic axle down the center of the rocket? come to think of it, when were technic axles invented.... its a neat little set, makes me think i oughta make some similar kinda layout in ldd, very elegant for playability.

0 i always thought that that grey thing on top of the rocket was some kind of satelite... xenologer, on jul 4 2008, 05:25 am, said: huh, did they not think of putting a technic axle down the center of the rocket? come to think of it, when were technic axles invented.... i had this set as a kid and i don't think there was a technic axle inside that rocket, but if i remember correctly some of the later cs rockets did.

1 i'm loving that trans-yellow plate on top of the roof. great review!

1 nice rewiew the set is good too)

1 hey eb'ers, i got my market street on monday and finished building it last night. i know it?s not such a nice review like *yoda* did the last times, but i hope you enjoy some of the pics. first a pic of the complete building: the 3 minifigs: and i pic of the stairs (one of my highlights at this set): more pics you can find here my opinion about the set: i like this set very much, it was really fun to build it. i?m happy that that i got some more cherries and a croissant now *sweet* , a funny idea is the salad in the one box at the front. i think normally it?s a hairpiece of an exoforce fig. i also like the colours of the house, the dark blue is sooooo nice. i think i have to take more of this soon. the lighter blue is also nice. this set has really nice details like the stairs, or the owl at the entry of the market, or the balcony. i paid 89,99 eur, a fair price for a really nice set!! greetings sandra

1 thanks for the review, my favourite detail is the salad! :-d btw, could you exchange the modules and make pics of that? i'd like to see how the building looks with the flat roof instead of the dutch style one. i'm not sure though if the vents on the flat roof makes sense as long as it's only used as a garage top... :-/ maybe they should be removable as the balconies and such things to make the modularity leading not to weird results... other than this: in combination with a lot of money and the cafe corner set this really could get me into city! ;-)

1 thanks, i love the look of this set! i love the mix of colours, it breaks up the model rather than being a single monotone colour. he's used several complimentary colours in order to make up the model. i agree i think the chimneys on the flat roof is weird ontop of the garage, but not so weird one you place it ontop of the building. i guess he's done it to give us the choice of roofs and chimneys. you can always remove the ones you don't like... he also seems to have screwed up a bit on the tiling for the sidewalk on the side module. on cafe corner (and the building module of this set) the sidewalk has the pattern light grey 1x6 at the front, then dark grey 1x2 next, then dark grey 2x2's. however on this he's put the 2x2 tiles first then the 1x2's at the back. easilly fixable though. overall i love this set, thanks for the pics! compliments cafe corner perfectly.

1 thank you legocastlegirls for your quick review! *y* it?s the first time i realize the back of the market street. the tan bricks are a replacement for some windows i?d guess? i do love that building, especially the top floor with the neat balcony. *wub* of course you are (again) left alone filling the interior. but i just had some food parts ordered at bricklink... x-d one thing i?d like to know: this is an online-exclusive, right? can i order it at a lego-store (k?ln / oberhausen) and get the sum rewarded on my voucher booklet? *sweet* i heard it here, but i?m not sure. 8-| if anyone is looking for how to fill it with interior: go read the latest brickjournal #8! there?s a whole chapter written about designing the rooms. interior on!

1 i still haven't bought the cc or ms. but reviews like this make me wanna buy them instantly. thanks for this legocastlegirl !!

1 thank you very much for that nice review and those lovely pictures, legocastlegirl! *y* a very interesting set with a great color scheme and some "sunny side" feeling indeed. *sweet*

1 legocastlegirl, on jun 20 2007, 07:42 am, said: i know it?s not such a nice review like *yoda* did the last times, but i hope you enjoy some of the pics. nonsense sandra !! tks for sharing these cool pics ;-) its also a nice hommage to erik brok. i really like this set, i think its really well designed with great ideas such as the dual stairs, the balconies, the croissant insignia, the market entrance design with the horns, whip and owl 8-? i like the color combination, and the mosaic design just in front of the entrance. the only terrible flaw is that yellow cinlinder !! that is just awful for a flower pot :-x i don't mind at all having that lamp post at the same level since it would be normal to have the base of the lamp at the level of the tile but i agree that is just pickering about an insignificant detail :-p legocastlegirl, on jun 20 2007, 07:42 am, said: a funny idea is the salad in the one box at the front. i think normally it?s a hairpiece of an exoforce fig. yeay that is just brilliant all the way 8-? this is a great set indeed and a must have for town fans !! *yoda*

1 legocastlegirl, on jun 20 2007, 05:20 pm, said: i also think that this is a replacement for some windows and i like this idea, because i often see houses with that kind of "windows" there was once "windowtaxes" in the netherlands. when rich people became poor, they placed bricks in their window, so they paid less taxes. some older houses still has walls were once were windows. historic information on :-d :-p

0 it was the same thing in france in the middle-age... happy that today this taxe is gone! :-d

1 hi all! i just got my first gentle giant sw maquette and i?m in love *wub* *wub*! it looks so coooool ...... *y*! here?s some facts: height: 13.8 cm color: black 8-? helmet: non removable #?s made: 500 pieces sold at: blister event tokyo june 16, 2007 and now some pictures: i will crush you with my left bigtoe x-d! on the catwalk x-d! now i just have to wait for my boba fett, luke skywalker and get the stormtrooper & darth vader ..... >:-)! on my shelf on copmike

0 woooooooooooow! that's some maquette! say, i wonder if the blackhole stormie will be playable in lswtcs? maquette on!

0 thank you, interesting indeed. those are quite expensive though, perhaps 60 dollars or more.

1 very nice *wub* how'd you get a hold of it?

1 wow, that's awesome! and look, a giant 3x3 lego piece! 8-? :-d edited by iamded, 27 june 2007 - 08:03 am.

1 starwars4j, on jun 27 2007, 04:48 am, said: very nice *wub* how'd you get a hold of it? evilbay can be your friend >:-)! here?s the text from the back of the box: quote for much of the galactic civil war, a mysterious agent of palpatine code-named blackhole carefully sifted through countless streams of data, distilling it into useful information for imperial intelligence. blackhole had an impressive amount of resourses available to him, including a entire star destroyer and its complement of troops and fighters. per his orders, the stormtroopers under his command had their armor cast in black to match his own particular eccentricities. the armor modification had practical benefits as well. the stygian-triprismatic polymer afforded the stormtroopers increased sensor-stealth. *wub* - pure poetry x-d! blackhole on copmike

1 thats so cool! i would want one. it would look good in the house. -zots

0 iamded, on jun 28 2007, 07:43 am, said: so, were you serious about any of the boba fett, luke skywalker, stormtrooper & darth vader ones? because i'd love to see a boba fett and vader one. :-d dead serious >:-)! the vader & stormtrooper maquettes are already sold out, have to go ebay on them in august. luke is coming out in the 6212 x-wing bonus pack: and boba fett was up for preorder over at starwars.com shop before it also sold out: maquettes on copmike

1 hi, you are right, this is such a fantastic maquette. i really hope that i will get the chance to own the other 4, too. it is carefully packed in styropor. the painting is nice, looks really evil. i think it is a wonderful addition (with the 4 other) to any collector shelf..(-; mine is number 276. greetings hendrik

0 i have #70 (and #8 :-$ ). boba soon on copmike

1 mutley777, on dec 2 2009, 07:29 am, said: well it has taken me over 2 years but i have finally bought this maquette! it's a real beauty! just don't ask what it cost! my set of maquettes is finally complete. *snip* wow! mutley that is so beautiful!!!! i've seen these maquettes around before but they are alittle pricey , would love to get afew though! just had alook on ebay and wow they sure are selling for a pretty darn high price! great review copmike, even though it was two years ago. i hope your collection is complete now aswell. commanderfox edited by commanderfox, 01 december 2009 - 06:57 pm.

1 great reason to review a great thread. your collection is truely something to behold.

1 wow thats so cool mutley. my favourites are darth vader and luke skywalker because the others seem to have funny looking heads. not so much boba fett but the storm trooper and the blackhole stormtrooper do. it must be their helmets. edited by roncanator, 02 december 2009 - 08:29 am.

1 i always wanted one of these (*sighs*) i don't think that i'll ever get it though.

1 a very nice review with good pictures, thanks grevious. *y* and undead ragdolls on! :-p

1 wow! that was both an entertaining time, and a learning experience! it was entertaining because the comic made me laugh! it was a learning experience because, well, i dunno. just wanted to say it. anyways, great review, grievous! edited by trooperdavinfelth, 01 july 2007 - 09:46 pm.

1 thanks for the review. that set is high up on my list; how could it not be with a price like that! (i love the added story.)

1 nice review and a great story also grevious, this is a great set and a nice little army builder one at that. the only thing that saddens me about the line itself is the new arms on the skelies, they just look far to big when placed next to a normal fig. for me the old versions of the skelies were far better, why tlc changed to this is beyond me. still i shall be buying alot of these sets just to increase my army.

1 tks a lot grevious for this !! regarding the set i just love it !! i really oved your comic, it was really well done and hilarious x-d eb spirit on !! vader, on jul 2 2007, 08:28 am, said: still i shall be buying alot of these sets just to increase my army. you don't say mate, i bought like 10 or so so far x-d medieval *yoda*

0 thanks for all the comments, guys, and thank you, joem16 and iamded for pointing out the reason for the skeleton horse leg positioning. ;-) well, i'll be gone on vacation until the 16, but i may pick up a set or two while down in tenessee, so if i do, expect a review and another story when i get back! ;-)

1 grim reaper on! the new skellie looks so much more natural with the droid arm *y* !

1 great review, i love this set.

1 great review *y* small set with great figs and pieces=must buy the story was hilarious :-) any chance you are going to review another set? i'm still waiting for a certain member *cough*hinckley*cough* to review skeleton tower :-d piranha

0 i've searched high and low accross england to find this...and it's nowhere! i'm too stingy to buy off s@h and so i'll wait my turn. ok, now ot the set: let's say i buy 3, for ?12. that's 6 soldiers, 3 skellies and 3 horses. considering each fig is worth ?1 and horses 75p, that means 25p for the catapult! awesome! there's no lego castle anywhere in england! :-/

0 i have not seen any either.... :-/

0 it seems the catapult defence has been taken off s@h for nz, so i assume it's out of stock for us. it's been off for a while. you guys might want to check your countries too. ~peace

1 that was a great review!!! very entertaining! :-d love the comics!

1 here is a review of the new monster dino creator set with power functions first lets start with the box which is much larger than it needs to be!! it is one of the new style re-closeable boxes rather than the rip the sides style. this set is typical of creator and comes with three sets of instructions. the monster dino a kind of spider and a crocodile the set comes with two of the new motors one small and one large, a sound module plus the new ir controler and receiver. there is a mix of techniques in this set the core is mainly studless technic, there are some studded technic parts and most of the details are standard creator style. there are two mechanisms one to control the legs and one to control the head and arms. the leg drive is from the large motor and the arm and head are operated from the small motor the completed mechanism will stand on its own without any detail added the detail is added to the base unit to complete the model. the operation of the dino is very good the design for the motors and drives is very compact and well thought out. the walking motion works well although there is no steering and it will fall over it it encounters obstacles. the sound module is built into the head so when the mouth opens the dino roars (sort of) glyman made the comment that this set is ugly as sin and i tend to agree i think there are too many colour variations with different shades of grey, black and that lime green :-p which confuses the look of the finished model but i guess it might apeal more to younger kids. i also do not like the spikes along the back, which glow in the dark, because the are loose and keep falling off. this set is not cheap at ?70 but i guess this is because of the motors and ir controller. while on this i was surprised how good the range was on the new controller it would still operate ever when not in direct line of sight. i would give this set a 10/10 for playabilityit has kept the kid amused for hours i would give it 6/10 for value for money it is a bit pricey overall 8/10 it took approx 3 hours to build and has been well played with i have posted some more images and some videos of the finished models on my brickshelf page here if you have any questions please ask pete edited by whitefang, 23 may 2009 - 06:28 pm. indexed

1 thanks for your review ickelpete! *y* nice little movie you made (what?s on tv in the background?) ;-) :-d after reading, i wonder more than before what this dino has to do with creator? *wacko* the complete mechanism is technic, only the "design"-pieces on top are classic-style. i agree with your comment on the colour-selection. :-x is that turquise next to lime? looks like - well, i?m not telling you what i think of right now... ;-) pretty lego set, but not for me. i?m waiting for the first pics of the ferris wheel. or even better, the 8275 technic-bulldozer :'-) *wub* new motors on!

0 thank you very much for that interesting review, ickelpete. *y* well, the color scheme?s pretty bad and the design of that dino?s a bit to blocky for my liking, but the two alternative models you?ve built?re quiet nice. at least there?re a lot of possibilities coming with that set.... :-)

1 :'-) such a beauty, the functions are great, cool video! i want to get this set so badly... great review! *y*

1 i bought this set last night and it is great. my biggest surprise was the wheels that were included; i didn't even know they existed and there aren't even that new. back to the set, he is such a cute dinosaur. :-d since he is so tubby i think he looks like a baby! i suspect my wife wanted him more than me.... my biggest interest in the set was to have more motors and ir parts so i could make an ir car. overall, i highly recomend this set, but as others have said, be warned that the box is very oversized. i wish lego would give up on this whole 1:1 picture thing. *wacko*

1 got this baby via shop@home a little early and i though it was time to post my view of this set : (snefroe you need to get this one ;-) ) sorry for the lack of pics but there are already many pics online of this baby so here it is : best space set since... a way too long time this is my first new space themed set since more than 20 years and i must say that im not disappointed at all. i have much to say about this little gem. first, lets cut it straight about the martians minifigures: they are absolutely rubbish. i cant imagine how lego could produce such atrocity. this said; lets move on to the dropship. a real piece of art. reminiscent of the aliens movie dropship. the cockpit is spacious and provides a great field of view, too bad there is no hinges to open it, you must remove the canopy completely to switch pilot. the drilling unit can be attached under the ship with the clever use of a rubber piece. it stays well in place once attached, good point. some people dont like the inclusion of the 2 containment area for the martians and crystal on both side of the ship but i kind like it, it makes the ship less empty. the 2 wings are complete with air intake, some armaments and 1 standard launcher on the right wing. normally i dont like launchers but this one is very discrete and well integrated. on the tail section are 2 thrusters that can be rotated and provide thus some realistic movements to the ship. one of the last highlight of this ship is the landing gears, or i must say landing dishes. 6 medium sized radar dishes provide and incredible stability to the set. they are quite sturdy and can take a beating. im not going to review the alien spaceship in detail since its quite uninteresting. i consider it more like a bonus addition to the set than anything else. the look is passable and there are some interesting building techniques in it. thats all. to end the review, a little pros/cons table. (we all love pros/cons table :-) ) pros: - incredible design - at last a decent space set - modular functions - quite sturdy - beautiful - great value for money cons: - martians are rubbish - no hinges for the canopy - the drilling unit could use some more details. score: 9/10 by the way , i added a nice cool feature on my site , you can download the stickers for some sets that i own. before building i always scan the stickers, we never know it could come handy. check this out on my site (you need to go in the lego lists on the left): [vtx] classic games

1 great review, i must admit i didn't like mm at first site, but seeing this review and looking at the mm boxes at stores appeal to me rather greatly, i may get a couple of these sets, great job! *y* :-)

0 i've got it also, but i think i'll replace the ball joint pieces with the kind of pieces that give the wings their angle.

1 i like the dropship kit and got this. now that i built it i see so many things i can do to tweak it to make it a moc. i think this is a set everyone mm fan should get.

1 the dropships looks neat, and your review is good. it isn't my theme, but it clearly is a fantastic set for the space lovers under us. mars mission is really a good step in the right direction for tlc.

1 impressive review! really clear photos too! thanks. dr. s.

0 a very nice review, thanks dunamis. *y* i really don?t understand that color scheme, but the new motors?re very interesting. well, that dino is just mediocre to me.... i think that the new technic bulldozer is much more interesting.

1 great review dunamis i hope you have as much fun with this as i have. one point yes they are new axles they have appeared in a few sets this year.

1 ickelpete, on jul 13 2007, 11:06 pm, said: great review dunamis i hope you have as much fun with this as i have. one point yes they are new axles they have appeared in a few sets this year. yes, the kids seem to love it (as you pointed out) and the wife still thinks i am crazy so it's all good. i read your review after i posted mine. seems like we shared the same thoughts on a majority of it. i always think it is good to have multiple opinions on sets as it gives the community more data points to evaluate a given set.

-1 i already made my 5 cents to this horrible colour bastard :-x :-x :-x in ickelpetes thread, but i wanted to clarify about this: dunamis, on jul 13 2007, 10:41 pm, said: finally, i?ve never seen one of these before (although someone will no doubt rattle off a dozen sets where you can find this part in about 5 seconds): here?s one of the sets it?s included in: it didn?t even take me 5 seconds. ;-) :-p

1 thanks for the bonus review. i am still on the fence with this one so every opinion is good! dunamis, on jul 14 2007, 07:41 am, said: but what about the at-at??? in case you don't know, the at-at in the dark side development kit had a single motor and a moving head. it worked by the head simply swinging from side to side due to balence shifts. i suspect the at-at will be same. i also think that there will be no remote for it either. edited by sinner, 14 july 2007 - 11:31 am.

1 tks once again dunamis for a great in-depth review ;-) i really look forward to your supped up and moded at-at :-p i am really not found of the design but i think its still a nice parts pack, especially with all these nice "power function" elements ;-) *yoda*

1 thats a nice looking dino set there! great review, dunamis! also, on this side of the border (see that big thing above the us? thats canada, where i'm from) byob still means bring your own beer. my uncle is already on his third molsons. edited by lieutenant colonel thok, 14 july 2007 - 02:21 pm.

1 wow...that set is really something. but i prefer pehistoric power, and triceratops. or are they the same? i can never tell.

1 i kind of like the design of this, but more importantly i really want to get my hands on the power functions motors and ir control system. i'd prefer the 8275 technic bulldozer, but there's no way i can stretch to the ?100 price tag, so i was thinking i would have to see if i could get a 4958 monster dino cheap in the january sales. then two things happened today. firstly i saw the dino in tescos reduced from ?70 to ?55. then my wife said she'd buy it for me for christmas. wow! that's never happened to me before. i love my wife! *wub* can't wait till christmas now!

1 i ended up buying a misb set recently from a lego collector who is clearing up his collection. excellent set to get the ir remote and ir receiver and other motors without paying insane amounts for the bulldozer now. there is a quite a number of parts in power miner lime green and 1x1 white teeth plate for the mouth and claws. the dino alone has 20 teeth in its mouth the glow in the dark "antennas" on the backbone of the dino is a nice touch as you can let him walk in the dark somewhat. i do agree with the reviewer, the box is insanely huge!!! i don't think lego wanted to show a 1:1 scale dino, they just wanted to promote the power function stuff as large as possible. also, the remote is smaller than shown in the picture as the hand holding it i think is smaller.

1 this is both my first set review and post about a star wars set- (even though i have been collecting them since '99). i got this one early this year so i thought i would post a review on it. please bare with me- i am not a great photographer. so with that in mind, here goes! front of the box: 75083 at-dp box-front by whitesidewjw, on flickr back of the box: 75083 at-dp box- back by whitesidewjw, on flickr shot of the bags: 75083 at-dp bags by whitesidewjw, on flickr the sticker sheet (i normally don't apply them, but for this i am going ahead and putting them on): 75083 at-dp sticker sheet by whitesidewjw, on flickr minifigs- i really like the two at-dp pilots, but the best agent kallus really does shine. of course we get an extra stormtrooper: 75083 at-dp minifigs by whitesidewjw, on flickr no new molds in this as far as i can tell, however these printed 4x4 domes are really great. i can see lots of uses for these in space mocs. 75083 at-dp new printed elements by whitesidewjw, on flickr bag#1 complete- nothing earth shattering here- an easy build: 75083 at-dp bag #1 complete by whitesidewjw, on flickr bag #2 complete: 75083 at-dp bag #2 complete cockpit seats by whitesidewjw, on flickr cockpit assembly: 75083 at-dp cockpit assembly by whitesidewjw, on flickr bag #2 complete 75083 at-dp bag#3 complete by whitesidewjw, on flickr "foot" assembly"- i like how they positioned the slopes 75083 at-dp "foot" assembly by whitesidewjw, on flickr complete at-dp 75083 at-dp complete by whitesidewjw, on flickr complete at-dp-side view 75083 at-dp side view (complete) by whitesidewjw, on flickr complete at-dp- over view 75083 at-dp complete- overview by whitesidewjw, on flickr complete at-dp rear view 75083 at-dp rear view by whitesidewjw, on flickr extra pieces 75083 at-dp extra pieces by whitesidewjw, on flickr the verdict: minifigs- 5/5- we get a total of four figs. i like the two at-dp pilots and agent kallus is a well done minifig. i can complain about another storm trooper either parts- 3/5- other than the dome pieces i commented on before, there is really not any new parts in this. if you build space, star wars, or machinery, this will still be a welcome assortment. experience of build 4/5- this really was a fun build. it came together fast but was challenging enough for its target age group. playability 5/5- this thing is much more sturdy than it looks. the legs take a little bit of effort due to the double locking hinges but hold together very well.this is a very minor complaint. value 4/5- typical- $49.99 for 500 pieces- i must admit i paid a little more than msrp due to shipping but i can't complain about the value. overall: 21/25- i really believe this is one of the best walkers that lego has designed. the only changes i would make would be adding real control panels in the cockpit and it would be nice if lego made a real widow to fit in with these types of builds rather than a transparent tile over another plate. all in all, i would recommend this set and i hope the rest of the 2015 star wars sets are on par with this.

1 thanks for the early review! i don't know much about the rebals show at all, but i can say that the over all design of the walker really appeals to me and the minifigs look top notch. i also like how the spring shooters are pretty much hidden in the frame, nice job!

-1 looks really nice. one complaint is the back it is a pitty that lego didn't use any plates greebling there.

1 thanks for the review. cannot wait for the 2015 sets.

1 pretty good first review! this looks pretty great, i probably won't be getting it due to budget constraints. (bionicle) but still, very nice set. to me it kinda looks like the missing link between when the at-st evolved into the at-at. also, i know the rebels stormtroopers get a lot of hate, but i really like them. thanks for the review!

0 thanks for the review! i have two questions: - what is the driver standing on, when the hatch is open and he is looking out? - could you show the face of kallus without helmet, please? my only complaint is that the colours of both, kallus's and the drivers's uniforms are wrong. kallus's uniform is way too dark and should be more dark olive than black, and the drivers's uniforms are too bright and should be more greyish compared to what we saw in the series.

0 whats behind the printed 4x4 dome? is that 2x4 yellow plate? im planning to replace that.

1 great first review! as a huge walker fan its great to get one thats not a redesign, or one of those tiny battlepack vechicles.

1 awesome! i am really looking forward to buy this, but is it really $50.00 us? i was hoping more around $30.00. also, i was wondering how the hip section for the legs work, does it have a stiff turning axis to it?

1 whitswj, on 24 december 2014 - 02:53 pm, said: here are the pics of kallus- his head would be good for a steam-punk character. thanks! indeed his face printing is really nice, they captured his looks and spirit well.

0 great set, really impressed. odd that lego didn't include stickers for the controls - can't think of a reason they wouldn't have. and why do only 3 of the 4 figures have leg printing? i just can't understand lego at times

0 namioik, on 25 december 2014 - 08:53 am, said: i mean, it fits the 10 cents per piece count and has 4 figures so for a licensed theme you can't beat that. but i guess lego can never satisfy everyone this is true. i just had that price in mind when i saw the first images of it. it did not appear to be this big or complex, but new sets are getting so much more advanced than what they used to be.

0 i built this set and i think the two rubber pieces holding the both sides of the face is a bit stretched out therefore making the set somewhat tight for entire top hatch to open and close. does anyone have the same situation? is this right? -------------- never mind i got it! i built the back a stud too long! edited by namioik, 29 december 2014 - 03:04 am.

0 thanks for the early review! how tall is this next to the most recent recreation of the at-at? i'm picturing the two of them standing next to each other looking silly due to the scale differences.

-1 great reveiw, shame on lego for forgetting that they already made a at-dp pilot helmet (ezra's from the phantom set) that didn't resort to needing a printed head.

0 thanks for the review and pics. this is a really nice looking walker. one question - how snug are the at-dp drivers sitting in their seats? the cockpit looks good. actually i'm not crazy about the at-dp helmets on the show but i dig the minifigs! good stuff. awesome facial hair for kallus!

0 hellbelly, on 31 december 2014 - 11:05 pm, said: it's a different helmet. ezra's is an imperial cadet helmet (the same one he wears in "breaking ranks). i meant the mold opposed to the paint job.

1 knightsword, on 01 january 2015 - 02:27 am, said: i meant the mold opposed to the paint job. the mold wouldn't really work. the way they did it is actually very accurate.

1 a great review of an obviously fantastic set. a must-have for 2015! thanks!

1 i want more of the story you made! also, ace review.

1 brilliant review and thanks for plenty of detailed shots of the interior, i may invest in this set but ill have to wait until 2015 star wars is sorted and budget for the arrival of pirates in april!

0 can you please take some pictures/explain how the water tower is built? i understand that there are some tank treads bot how exactly? and it is "there can be only one"! edited by yooha, 01 january 2015 - 07:14 pm.

1 looking forward to picking up this set on saturday :-) nice review, love the tiny details and the printed parts.

0 nice review, thanks a lot. managed to improve my opinion of the set a bit, but i'm still getting two to build larger buirldings as soon as we get the next 2x vip points special

-1 thelazychicken, on 01 january 2015 - 06:14 pm, said: great review! the intro was great, but i'm still not convinced on this one. the height seems too small for comparison with the rest of the modulars. the play features are ok but i wish it would have been taller. totally agree with you, the height does seem rather small. also 2x buildings on a 32x32 base-plate with a lots of spare studs behind the buildings are these buildings 12 studs in width?. it still looks great style wise, however this might be a set i buy and look at it after i have built it & regret the amount of $$$ i have spent on it. $239 for us aussie's . edited by snaplock, 01 january 2015 - 07:42 pm.

1 this modular building will be my next set! thanks for the review!

0 thank you for the review, it was very interesting and changed my opinion of the set, i'm now considering a future purchase ^^. just one question: the mirror is on cardboard? i was hoping for it to be a window piece with a mirror on one side.. i hope it's not the same cardboard we had on some of the early harry potter sets or the element won't last long

1 amazing review! very thorough with lots of details

1 thanks for the review! i'm a fan of the set but will be modding quite a bit. have to get a small bar into the highlander and then turn the second/third story above the barber shop into a proper apartment. the detective's office is great and will stay as is!

1 thank you for the amazing and really well-readable review! makes me want to get the set even more!

1 lego's affiliation with six wheelers go back a long way. i think the first one was released in 1981, more than 25 years ago. this year, lego added another one to the family, mars mission's "rhino 1", as its title sounds... it's been a while since i've bought and opened a large box, so maybe this isn't a surprise to most of you, but the box does not open at the front, as with many larger sw boxes, but at the side. the two printed seals(or whatever people call them) have gone as well, being replaced by one larger print in the middle of side... the box also isn't as thick as a large sw box, like the sandcrawler... the general size is, however, still quite large. pict0001.jpg 281.91k 102 downloads the back side shows the mars mission theme sets... eccept the rhino! i guess it shows this set will be released as a tru exclusive or something, only to show up in legoland shops and maybe lego shops... it's a shame really, because this is by far the best set of the theme. pict0002.jpg 285.42k 89 downloads when you open the front cover, you see a larger picture picture of the rhino. obviously, it seems to be some sort of multifunctional truck. i think the basic function is to drive around and explore. for that it has a drilling device and six giant wheels. pict0003.jpg 273.7k 82 downloads the set comes with two instruction books. i'm afraid to say they did not resolve the gray/black colors issue. colorwise, the real thing does not look like the instruction book because of it... pict0004.jpg 302.63k 75 downloads the rhino looks really big because of the six giant wheels. i guess it's more or less the same size as m-tron's magnetiser with the big difference between the two being that the wheels have been turned around, creating a unique wheel design for a lego model pict0285.jpg 290.59k 83 downloads pict0277.jpg 286.26k 80 downloads the wheels look very cool, even though the first couple of wheels stand a bit closer to each other. don't know why that is. hm... |-/ and they could have used a bit more body, but the design is pretty good. i know, "armagheddon" isn't far away... |-/ pict0292.jpg 216.75k 70 downloads the suspension of the wheels is a bit flimsy. sure, it allows the truck to move around in a more realistic way than the old sets, but it's not as flexible as some older sets, like sw's ctt. nor do the wheels have much body. the black bars you see on top of the wheels are more "window dressing" then functional... pict0293.jpg 244.78k 88 downloads the over all shape of the rhino is kinda "bulky", it looks more like a beatle than a rhino, if you're asking me. it has three major sections, but i wouldn't call it a modular building though... the cockpit is the first section. it's spacious and detailed. pict0290.jpg 262.77k 0 downloads pict0291.jpg 299.75k 87 downloads the cockpit hangs down from a weird angle. it's attached to a large vertical technic brick that is part of the rhino's main structure, so it's not a seperate spaceship, which is a shame... oh well... you can't have it all, i guess... pict0301.jpg 291.13k 78 downloads ah yes... stickers all over the place, but they're cool. the mid section of the rhino dominates the basic shape of the model. it's as if those two large white parts form a strong and thick shield, protecting whatever is inside from whatever is outsde. pict0007.jpg 213.22k 67 downloads unfortunately, there is nothing inside. it's extra space needed to house the spaceship. that's really a shame; a command center of some kind could have given the rhino a bit more "panache". pict0286.jpg 251.35k 87 downloads however, what's really great, is the way in which they fit together: one side has an orange 1x2 plate that fits in between two white 1x3 plates of the other side, creating yet another unique shape for a lego model. but again, it's a shame they didn't do more with this section... x-o pict0283.jpg 287.75k 82 downloads the third and last section is a platform for a space ship. pict0299.jpg 289.5k 77 downloads pict0287.jpg 199.78k 75 downloads the platform itself isn't really special. no details, no stickers,... it's just a skeleton to carry the spaceship, nothing more nothing less. no, your space ship doesn't fall off, even if you rotate the platform into a launch position, pushing the weight of the ship backwards. in fact, the position of the ship onto the platform is so solid, it's kinda difficult to imagine how this ship flies off. |-/ the ship on the other hand, is pretty cool. it's all sorts of things at the same time it seems. it transports two aliens, but also a small car that reminds me of the small sets of spacepolice 2, blacktron 2,... pict0295.jpg 307.4k 85 downloads pict0298.jpg 268.13k 75 downloads pict0294.jpg 276.84k 76 downloads the shuttle reminds me of a star trek shuttle and i think it needs some modding, but i do think it looks pretty nice. sure, the cockpit is a bit too low, a pilot needs to lay down instead of sitting down and the dropping mechnism, if there is one at all isn't all that brilliant either... the main structure is a bit too technical for me. i prefer actual parts with studs, not these lego technic bars and pins. pict0006.jpg 224.43k 74 downloads the crew: pict0276.jpg 239.43k 70 downloads ah yes, there's also this green plastic residu. think they are supposed to be the aliens... and there's also this weird alien craft, but i didn't bother to build that... *sad* good: *wub* great, innovative design, lots of potential, i even like the colors *sweet* lots of playability it's a big, attractive model; i don't see any weak spots in the design that could compromise stability or structural integrity. not so good: |-/ too many technic parts, some sections on the model, like the gun and the drilling device are a bit to flimsy i'd say 7.5-8.5/10 price: 750 danish crowns, about 105euro

1 thanks very much. i love it *wub* . it needs tweaking, but isn't that half the fun? incidentally, when people were calling it rhino, i thought it was just a reference to captain scarlet. seeing the stickers in the middle made me realise my mistake. buy! buy! buy!

1 thanks dude. this is a great set. can you please take more pictures? thanks

0 seems like they infuse system sets with more technic bars. must be that technic isn't selling too well and they want to educate ppl how cool technic can be. :-p it's quite apparent when even the small bike needed technic frame.

0 this set is truely incredible, a must have. but this set is also incredibly overpriced *n* ! com' on it's only a big vehicle , nothing really special to justify the near 100? price tag. this set is clearly worth something like 65? at max. look at the incredible dropship for 34?, that's a good value for money! *y* edited by mutex, 15 july 2007 - 04:57 pm.

1 awesome review, if i pick up any mm sets, it will definately be this one!

0 i echo the consensus of this thread - too much technic, looks great, too expensive, looks great.

0 please build the alien craft, i'm sure that we would all like a review of that! ^_^'

0 kahgarak, on jul 16 2007, 09:53 am, said: please build the alien craft, i'm sure that we would all like a review of that! ^_^' ok then... i'll do that later on... but i will not touch that plastic residu! x-d

0 kahgarak, on jul 16 2007, 12:53 am, said: please build the alien craft, i'm sure that we would all like a review of that! ^_^' bleh, i don't care much about the alien ship, they all look too much alike, the humans would kick the aliens crap out of them.

-1 i wish the wheels would be arranged like the turbo tank, this one looks too movable.

1 yes, they can hold the crystals. they can't move the hands ( |-/ ) but they do have the clawlike hand of the droid arm. edit: could you post some general 'beauty' pics of the rhino and the attached craft, such as front, side, back, etc. all we have of the ship is one top pic... edited by mr. mandalorian, 20 july 2007 - 05:18 am.

1 snefroe1, on jul 16 2007, 07:19 am, said: ok then... i'll do that later on... but i will not touch that plastic residu! x-d you touched them to put them in their holders in the ship. so in theory, you will not review them. anyways, nice review. i don't think i'll get this though. i'm trying to decide between this, moble devastator, or anothe 90$ set. i need to get something large before my b-day... regards, ~vbbn~

1 8-? such a wonderful machine! great review! too bad all my money is going towards the castle theme! >:-( my wallet is planning to kill me!

1 great review, wonderfully detailed. don't care for the ship at all. it's that 'technic under a hollow shell' thing like the ctt. if it wasn't for the figures, i would have hated it, and nothing about these figures excites me. i'll end up finding the least number of sets possible to provide at least one of each figure for the general population collection and skip the rest (unless they do as i expect and flop here, thus leading to huge discounts). i like this set ... at half off. ;-)

1 the life on mars theme was so much better, with the aliens dominating mars instead of the humans. and the aliens were so much better, with their own names etc. good times. anyway, i think this is the best set in the series. it looks so neat and reminds me of the pelican form halo. x-d edited by iamded, 31 august 2007 - 05:11 am.

-1 i agree iamded, life on mars, while not even that truly great, was far better than this line! >:-( i am hoping the next space line lego does takes place in just that! space! |-/ by the way iamded, i continue to stalk you....... batbrick away! >:-)

1 i think the life on mars series was great. although i didn't click until the line was gone that the red hangar on the alien base was for the red mech, and same with the blue one. man, i was gutted when i realised that, i want those mechs! however, the base was great, with the small mech and the flying crafts. could the lom mechs have been the spark of life for exo-force? 8-? edited by iamded, 31 august 2007 - 05:15 am.

0 i managed to get two sets for my twin girls for christmas, and would have to agree with your ratings (the anna and elsa figs are indeed excellent)

1 very nice review, mostlytechinc! once i saw this set i was interested in it for the colours and pieces...thanks for this review to shed more light onto it!

-1 isn't getting parts in new colors a good thing? it is a shame there is only this one set, i think tlg could make a whole subtheme out of frozen. i do agree that they overuse lavender and magenta, i don't see why every girl set has to have these sort of colors instead of what would be accurate to the source material .

1 thanks for the review mostlytechnic. i too wish they had done a real castle for this set, it certainly deserved it. my sons and i figure they could have used the old rock monster mold from rock raiders in white for the missing snow beast. i will pick it up though for the figs and unique pieces.

-1 when i first saw the pictures, i didn't realize that this set had so much color barf going on in it. also, there is a bunch of stuff that does not fit in with the movie, and it is pricey. the minifigures are nice, but no kristoff or sven. i thought about getting this, but this review is pushing me towards no.

1 i wish elsa had more of a white hairpiece rather than blonde. but it could be worse. not a bad set overall, although olaf doesn't look right without the twigs on his head. anna is a really nice and accurate fig.

0 the review is very well done. thanks! i don't know the movie. my key question is whether the bricks in the set will allow to build my own snow/ice creations. now, with "trans-glitter" being part of the design approach i am not so sure. can those who have already bought it tell me: can trans-glitter be used as "transparent with snow particles" or is it just terrible? i cannot really tell from the review pic above.

1 i think the trans-glitter blue panels can be icy or snowy just fine. i'm sure that's why they used them for this set. now, if you're looking for realism (like the photos in your sig seem to be), it might be tougher. but i've been thinking about using those big glittery panels to make a waterfall-type scene.

1 i'm literally of the exact opposite opinion to op here. i love the structure and the parts (this is a fantastic little parts pack that i'll be snagging more of when i find it again)...but i've no use for the figures (not a big disney princess fan). it's all about the parts. this set is freaking amazing! :d

1 well, the good news for you is you're in luck whenever you find sets, since the figs sell for a good bit of money :) right now the bricklink value of the 3 figs is about $30!

1 very nice review indeed and i also can't wait for the release of this set. it will be a superb wonderful addition to the lego disney princess theme.

1 thanks for the review. this will end up being a must buy for my daughter.

1 great review! i definitely agree, the minidolls are too awesome and are definitely a must-have. i love all the extra pieces from any set, some of them go on my phone case.

-1 bennemans, on 13 january 2015 - 06:08 pm, said: there is a very simple reason for the flowers and green-leaved trees; you should remember from the movie it was actually summer when elsa set of the eternal winter true, but all around her ice castle it is all winter. so why are there non-winter bits in this set? doesn't make sense. the picnic is because they wanted a mini-vignette for olaf to fit into, but the rest of the green and flowers don't make sense. tenorikuma, on 13 january 2015 - 09:58 am, said: i'm pretty sure i've gotten other sets recently with three pieces of tape on them. cool, good to know. was wondering but haven't remembered to look when i'm at a store recently. whitefang, on 13 january 2015 - 09:12 am, said: very nice review indeed and i also can't wait for the release of this set. it will be a superb wonderful addition to the lego disney princess theme. thanks for the fp, but "a lovely sweet review?" i thought i bashed this set pretty hard

-1 hello everyone, i am back to share with all of you, another of my legends of chima polybags review. it will be pretty comprehensive since the finished built will be quick and will be focusing more of what kind of fun that you can derive from there. this polybag was bought in september 2013, when i visited legoland malaysia and i did not hesitate to put this in my shopping basket. name: 30253 leonidas jungle dragster theme: lego system / legends of chima year: 2013 pieces: 30 minifigs: 1 minifigure price: usd n.a, gbp n.a, euro n.a, sgd n.a resources: brickset, bricklink an original polybag image of the 30253 leonidas jungle dragster back view of the original polybag image of the 30253 leonidas jungle dragster the road scout of the lions tribe this polybag design is definitely plan to be the quickest and fastest dragster to recce enemy front by making a swift scout for the lions tribe. i believe by the sound of the name, jungle dragster, it might just be suitable to use in jungle terrain. well, i don't quite agree that this is a 'dragster' even though it has the kind of open view concept of rolling in fast but it does not have the length of a typical dragster, similar to this town polybag design, for example. still, it is nice to have smaller variants of their vehicular supremacy. instruction manual (front) instruction manual (back) the lego building content with just 30 lego elements, you can be pretty quick to be able to display these laid out content. after the built is completed, these are the remaining spare parts. i am fond of the wheels which are some useful parts, other than that, there are nothing spectacular about it. my name is leonidas and i belonged to the lions tribe do not be mistaken of his name, leonidas to be the king of sparta who led the brave men of 300 spartans warriors to fight to the death against the persians. instead this character is based on the bio resided in lego.com, you will realise that he is aligned with the lions tribe and is a proud lion foot-soldier. he may have that goofy idiotic look but he can be very serious in his commitment to discharging his duties. you are able to observe his nice back view printing which reveal his black and blue sash. leonidas has a dual facial feature to reveal his much serious appearance. leonidas is one of the common characters available in the legends of chima universe. it can be found in a total of five sets. it is a great pity that there is no weapon being made for him in this polybag design which will certainly make a fine addition. the completed built of the jungle dragster this is the main design of the jungle dragster which is very simple looking. there is no distinct fighting capability from the vehicular design and it look just like a regular patrol vehicle. one thing i like about this, is the close distinct colour schema of the lions tribe. other than that, there is nothing special about it. moving off with my jungle dragster to conclude, this polybag is really meant for lego fans or collectors who appreciate legends of chima or wanting to sample the legends of chima theme. it is a very simple built, but yet could form a decent force size for recce purposes before sending in the big arsenals to whack their enemies. either way, i will only suggest you to buy it if you really love this theme at an inexpensive price. otherwise, it is perfectly alright to give this a miss. summary review playability: 4/10 (you need to have more lions tribe vehicles in order to bring the best and fun out of it since this is more of a supporting vehicle.) design: 4/10 (simplistic built of the dragster and main focus is just acquiring the minifigure.) price: 4/10 (bought at about usd$7, which is not an awesome price, so get it if you can get it more than half of this price.) overall: 4/10 (if only you are a huge mega fan of the legends of chima, then you need to get this.) i gave it a "2" based on my review score card. what about yours? i hope every one of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. comments and criticisms are strongly welcomed. pictures can be found in my flickr.

1 i love how the front/hood looks like a lion.

-1 good and helpful review again, whitefang. i probably have no use for a lionish creature with goofy looks...

1 thanks for this review, i love this set *wub* that batman is great, and i've always loved that awesome scarecrow fig. that new pumpkin is fantastic, i can't wait to get it in the set...how many come with the set? i hope more than two :'-( i love both of those vehicles, this set is a definite buy for me!

1 very nice hinckley! the payton and fenix thing was great *y* "carnavore!" :-d

1 that was a great review with loads of excellent pictures. the set is better than i thought. i want to buy one of the new sets as i would love a blue batman, but they are so expensive for australians. i love the new pumpkin heads. the story involved more mini-fig cruelty; excellent! i also liked the scarecrow/crow joke. :-d (one request; please don't say lines like "to the batcopter" next time. that is the old tv series and i hated that. >:-) feel free to tell me to stick my request up my m#g@bl*cks.)

0 great review *y* :-) your reviews are so funny they are so much fun to read especially the end part with the comic spoiler alert!!!! :-d gavin always dies though but it is still hilarious i can't wait till your next review or till your "book of the ancients tale" quick question,are you making it serious or funny? i prefer funny ;-) piranha

0 nice review. the batcopter is pretty neat, but i prefer scarecrow's bi-plane. quote batsy: we needed to wrap this review up so i used my baterang. bianca: is that really what it's called? batsy: beats me... nooo... it's batarang.

-1 great review! funny as allways! the comic was just a hell lot of fun. it really had me laughing. i would love to have this set but the price is just to high here, far worse than i had expected. i'll be better off buying the battank, which is much better priced. actually there is almost no price difference between the batcopter and the battank here *wacko*

(they are 60 aud and 120 aud.) i am still not sure if i will buy either... :'-( edited by sinner, 18 july 2007 - 11:47 am.

1 thanks for the review. i'm definitely getting this, mainly becasue it's batman. i love the blue bats, the scarecrow is good as ever, and those new pumpkins are just *wub* . there's a few things i'll mod, but nothing really major. i'll have to wait till i get this to decide properly though.

0 what a fine review and what a funny story, thanks! *y* dark tan and new technic hub.... very interesting. scare the crow on! :-d

1 sinner, on jul 18 2007, 08:24 am, said: i thought you would like it! i am pleased to say that i didn't know that "the jig is up!" was also a common line. most of what i remember about the old batman tv show actually comes from the movie as i own that. (mum bought it for me.) i tend to put in on if i have friends over and i am drunk enough. i like the darker side of batman only, and thus anything that is against the idea that batman is as big a loon as the guys that he hauls in i don't like. joel schumaker's movies fall well within that category. wait, what? are you saying you prefer the joel schumacher films? if you like the darker side of batman, i recommend the tim burton films. joel schumacher is as campy as "the jig is up" imo. he added freakin' nipples to the batsuit for god's sake! :-p you'd have to be nice and drunk to enjoy his films. ;-) i really like batman, batman returns and batman begins. sinner, on jul 18 2007, 08:24 am, said: santa brings presents here. in the middle of summer, in full winter rig. he is a hero. at least he can come down chimneys here without being burnt :-p ! no. no no no. i saw a movie once. i'm pretty sure it's a wallabee. xwingyoda, on jul 18 2007, 11:27 am, said: tks mate for this brilliant review :-d i loved your batfabuland story !! always fantastic to read like always *sweet* i really love this set and i shall buy 2 copies: one to build as is, and another one for my town loool: regular biplane for the tarmac, and my swat copter ;-) btw, i would have a request: could you post pic(s) of the parts inventory please ;-) many tks in advance !! *yoda* what nice things to say! :-$ thanks mate! you always make me feel brilliant. :-$ here is the parts inventory: (click to enlarge) the scarecrow plane would make an excellent crop duster and the batcopter will make an excellent swat copter. sweet! *sweet* thanks everybody else for the nice compliments as well. i'm deeply concerned about price differences in other countries. it seems pretty ridiculous and counter-productive for tlc. has anyone posted about this in the embassy forum?

1 excellent hinckley *y* *y* *y* ! looks like a nice set - i like the mix of dark batman-pieces and a bit lighter badmans-pieces. batmans new blue headpiece looks a bit off though. i love your stories *wub* - especially now-a-days when i?m a afofl x-d! keep up the work mister! dark tan on copmike

1 out of nowhere this set appeared at my local tru. hadn't been expecting this one for a while, so a nice surprise. *sweet* firstly the box. nice pic on the front. good selection of minifigs. the officer and pilot look cool with their dark blue trousers. a new r2 unit as well. don't remeber this in the film, but great to have one in a new colour. *wub* back of the box shows some of the ship's nifty features. first thing you notice when you open the box, is the awesome selection of bricks. this makes a for a great parts pack. loads of unusual red and dark red pieces. it's so refreshing to see a star wars set that isn't predominantly grey. there are also two instruction booklets. as soon as you open the first booklet you hit an error. why would i want two obi-wans? :-| it's also at this point that you come across a big disappointment. on the box you get a flesh qui-gon. what is actually in the box is an epiii obi-wan. come on lego - why change it? |-/ all the figures look impressive in the flesh despite the big mistake. once i started the build it progressed rapidly. red pieces seem to be a lot easier to find. lots of clever techniques. quite a few technic elements get used at the start. it reminded me of building a technic set from the 80s at times. here is the main body half way through the build. the landing mechanism is a nice touch. its not fully retractable, but still folds away nicely. you find the ship keeps tipping over as you build it despite the feet, as it's only at the end thay it all becomes evenly balanced at both ends. here the feet are extended. you can also see the yellow knob that rotates the radar on top of the ship. landing gear up viewed from the front. here are the radar. a great collection of dishes. they spin easily with little friction. here is the ship at the half way point. the front works well with the top flipping up to squeeze in the pilot. more to come... :-)

0 thanks for this great review *y* :-) and welcome to eurobricks *n* whats with the obi wan head??? darn tlc........ piranha

-1 what's up kernow!!?? nice review. thanks for sharing. welcome to eurobricks, i hope you have fun here! :-d x-d that qui-gonn thing is weird. come on lego! someone is just asleep at the wheel over there with quality control. missing pieces, injections molds, slipping quality, ice cube trays...imo, that's a huge thing to miss. the mini-fig on the box doesn't come in the set=false claims. anyway, the ship looks beautiful and i wanted this set when i first saw it and your review confirms that it is very cool. thanks again! x-d x-d

1 7665 review part 2 the second half of the build goes quicker than the first. once you start to add the engines, the ship really begins to take shape. the main body of the ship has a few surprises hidden away under a removable cover. inside you get some retracting guns, a storage box, a little shuttle and space for a droid and figure. here is everything you can fit inside. the guns are concealed behind the side vents. pushing them forward causes the vents to open. closed: and open: the final feature is the passenger area/escape pod. inside is plenty of space for two figures. the pod cleverly attaches by pushing the front section of the ship forward, sliding the pod in, then returning the front. everything locks together and is held securely in place by an elastic band. :-) here's a couple of pictures of the final model. it's not the most beautiful creation ever, but it is an excellent representation of the ship from the film. the angular shape actually suits a lego build well. there's one more useful feature. the whole ship can be safely and comfortably picked up by two ball ended technic pins towards the back end. it balances well at this point and does allow you to swoosh the ship around much more easily. this was the most enjoyable star wars build i've had in a long time. everything progresses nicely with almost no repetitive bits. the ship looks good and is also huge! *sweet* compare it to the 6211 isd and you'll see it's only fractionally smaller. when i first saw pictures of this on the internet i thought it looked ok. once you see it for real it is much more impressive. for ?69.99 in the uk i'm not complaining. it's the best value star wars set of the year so far. to conclude: pieces: 9/10 minifigures: 7/10 (would be a 9 apart from the stupid qui-gon/obi-wan head error) playability: 8/10 originality: 9/10 set design: 8/10 overall: 8.2/10 the box says this is a limited edition set (whatever that means). so if you're planning to get it i'd suggest you grab it at the first opportunity. i'm glad i did! x-d edited by kernow, 22 july 2007 - 10:56 pm.

0 brick miner, on jul 31 2007, 07:46 pm, said: as for the set, the thing that jumps out at me most is the use of dark blue for water... im so used to seeing the classic blue for water, that the dark blue seems weird. i don't like it. - bm indeed, i only noticed this when i saw the s@h images. i guees that they're on dark waters. you can always put some trans blue and trans clear 1x1 round plates, no? i tried that technique to make the lava (using trans red and trans orange plates), it looks neat. regarding the human soldier thing yoda mentioned, it's quite weird. like him, i'm going to swap the legs, so they're coherent with the soldiers from the other sets. third note: is it just me or did you attach the two black gate pieces too high? shakar

1 not sure i like this one much. i like many of the new parts but the boat isn't that great and i would rather get each seperately so i can avoid the whole skeleton army. nice review though!

1 asuka, on aug 1 2007, 01:47 pm, said: no, i think this is correct. the upper plate with clip for the door is a little high, on top of a dark gray 1x1 brick. so if you want the door to operate well you have to place it like that. i just put the clip under that brick, a very easy fix, so my door now is lower which looks better imho, and no sneaky skelly can crawl along under it.... x-d exactly. asuka is correct. also keep in mind that the picture was taken looking down on the model that is sitting on the carpet. it makes the gap appear a little larger. in addition; for those of you that recommended ironing the sail, it worked great. i set the iron to low and used a t-shirt to protect the sail. it flattened it out perfectly. in fact, it worked so well, that i did the same with my old ww weapons wagon cover that has gotten wrinkled over the years. the iron worked perfectly.

1 yes, very nice review mr brickster! i think i , for a change, like the castle part better. the ship doesn't look quite right to me. if they're gonna make a pirate theme with ships like this i wouldn't be very happy... but i think the ship brings some nice accesories. like the anchor, a black mid piece(!), steering wheel etc. i think i'll buy it eventually. wout, on aug 1 2007, 08:19 pm, said: nice review, i like the building/port the most mmm,dark blue plates *wub* pity it is a toys'r'us exclusive, in the netherlands there are only toys'r'usses in the greater cities. ah, that's good to know, now i won't be searching in other toystores as well! thanks! mr tiber

1 ok here is the set alot of us star wars fans have been waiting for! the 7666 hoth rebel base! *wub* first the box now the great minifigs! that stunning k-3po fig! now the snowspeeder! aaaaggghhhhh these parts are all stickers! now for the turret! the 2 cones on the side press in to fire out 2 blue lights saber blades :-d now for the small crane thingy. yes the part under the engine on the snowspeeder is another sticker 8-| echo base!! (well the front door anyway :-d ) the main control room? :-d again these are stickers on a tinted clear panel and on the slope |-/ i have no idea what this is meant to be! :-d finally 2 shots of the full set! *wub* well over all i really like this set and think it is great value for money. the minifigs alone would set you back more than the cost of this set. the build time was a good 2 hours or so and was good fun! the snowspeeder is not as good as the second snowspeeder and no where near as good as the first in my opinion, but i did love that first one. the k-3po fig is perfect and it is good to be getting more droids that aren't r2-d2 and c-3po. it is a shame about the stickers but that is the price of keeping the cost down i suppose (the only printed part in the whole set is the snowspeeder/x-wing windscreen). i will definately be getting atleast another 3 of this great set. 9/10

1 i love it.... depending on the australian price! (if it comes down here that is.) incidently, i have no idea what that other yellow thing is either! thanks for the review.

1 thanks for the review! mutley777, on aug 2 2007, 02:37 pm, said: i have no idea what this is meant to be! :-d that's to put the snowspeeder on (there should be a 2x4 plate underneath the snowspeeder that fits in that gap).

1 all i can say is... wow... can't wait for my local stores to stock this! nice review btw :-) does the snowspeeder actually fit through the door? thanks! edited by supernova, 02 august 2007 - 02:06 pm.

1 wow you are so lucky to have that sett ! , men ! tlc dont let me wait! , ?hh i mean tru

1 *y* awesome reveiw on an awesome set!!! i gotta get me one of these!! *y*

1 a very good review, thanks mutley777! *y* hmm, that shattered base looks better than i thought.... a very playable set, really nice. for the snowspeeder, i prefer the main gun design of its predecessor, but the grappling hook gun is a good improvement. if the door would just be large enough for it.... :-p

1 don't worry guys, the snowspeeder fits through the door easily :-)

-1 i thought after the king's royal castle uproar about stickers, lego would have gone back to printed bricks. obviously, it is all about costs these days and not about keeping people happy.

1 aayla-secura, on aug 2 2007, 03:22 pm, said: mutley , did you bought it @ tru? - are there any other sets? exept of hoth base , and is there the republic cruiser? i really had to restrain myself this morning! they had all the new star wars summer sets and republic cruiser too!!! there was a girl unpacking sets and saying to me, oh this ones just come in and this one :-d (showing me the republic cruiser, mtt, jedi with hyperdrive ring, naboo star fighter and the hoth base) i had to leave, or that would have ended up one very expensive morning :-d

1 wow!! why didnt you bought 3 of them :-d?

1 wow, i didn't think we'd get a review so fast 8-? really nice review, the pictures explain it all *y* :-) i really hope to get this set as it is really great... i guess :-d

1 the snowspeeder is love.

1 great looking set ... how much was it ?

1 sam89, on aug 2 2007, 04:53 pm, said: ?40 i think. yep! very reasonable *y*

1 excellent set. the snowtroopers are just amazing (most lego imperial troops are really good). however, it's sad that except from luke, all the rebels have the same face which is what is more the most unexpressive that you can find. for the rest, the quality looks excellent. the snowspeeder is far better than the first they realized (but only one thing: it looks a bit too white to me. i think i remember they were grey and orange rather than white in the film) and the echo base door is really cool. really nice set. edited by lord beckett, 02 august 2007 - 04:14 pm.

1 nice review mutley *y*! i agree with all your observations, especially stickers versus printed parts |-/! i get some of this and replace the snowspeeders with my v.2?s. hoth on copmike

1 jim, great review as always. you convinced me to get this one of these days, although not a to priority. any comments on which functions can be converted to pf and how well they work?

1 thanks for a great review. i've got a pile of tru and lego credit i wanna spend and was thinking about getting this (since i got a sneak peak of your review in the academy) but it's not here in the us yet. too bad. wonder when it'll hit? i do disagree about the manuals though. i find the thinner, stapled manuals easier to use than single large square-bound ones since they lay flatter when open. have any links to the prelim photos of the front end? i don't remember seeing that and was curious how different it looked.

1 really thorough review, jim. i am super jealous that you have 2 of these and i have none, with no opportunity to get one any time soon.

1 great review. i see now why the b model is so popular. i wonder though, on the car, if instead of the panels for the rear spolier (or wing) if they could have used studded panels and maybe layer them to give the appearance of, ie: a three element rear wing. i won't mention the front lights. if i had the money i would buy it for the b model. h

1 i think this set will be my next purchase. i love the color scheme and indeed it looks like a nice set. also 1200 parts for eur 100 is not a bad deal. and yes, the looks of the car have really grown on my since the first official pictures appeared. i'm curious how the bright green will work combined with other colors than white. i really hope more sets in the future will use the color (so that more different parts will be available over time). i think i'm the only person on eurobricks who doesn't like the looks of the b model, but i appreciate the extra functionality it offers. besides the set itself, i think this is one of the best reviews i have read in a while. great job on the superb photographs (which i think are essential to a review) and the extensiveness of it all. you really touched every subject, which is great :d

0 i think i read somewhere that the us will not get this set or the motorcycle until august 2015. that means the flagship most likely won't be in august but even later in the year... nothing bricklink can't solve though.

1 fantastic review jim, from the quality of the review alone it is easy to see how much hard work you have put into it. i'm with you on the instruction manual, i much prefer one quality bound book over umpteen stapled booklets. already have 2 of these sitting in the build queue, one for display model as i'm a fan of this one and one to build the b model then dissemble for parts, so i'm already sold on his set but still very much enjoyed taking the time it deserves to read through the review and ogle at your pro photography.

1 this is a mega review. you've taken the right pictures and the video demonstrations of the mechanisms really help get the good points of the set across. what's more amazing is that the review still feels very concise and to the point. you've actually convinced me to put this set on my list and not just as a decent parts pack. lasse d, on 12 march 2015 - 08:47 pm, said: - the front shouldn't open like that - instead it should be easy to remove the whole front cover, leaving the suspension easy to work on. - the aero seems to be realistic, except for the rear end where there's no indication of a venturi channel. this should have been easy to include. - there is no fuel tank, nor fixed fuel connector right behind the cabin. - there are no air jacks! seriously!? this is one of the most unique features of a race car like this... and lego forgot about them. instead they automated two functions which are manual on a real race car. - the top cars at le mans are hybrids with ingenious systems. i would have loved to see the front wheels connected to some kind of spinning apparatus indicating a kinetic energy recovery system. i'm not sure air jacks are the feature that will have people fawning over this set, and pneumatics are being covered rather well later in the year ... but i agree with everything else, most notably removable front and rear bodywork (the removable engine cover on 8674 would be a good starting point here) and the inclusion of some nod towards a hybrid system. it's also worth remembering the preliminary design did have the big honking fin (bhf) that is mandatory on all current prototypes, so maybe when that was removed any trace of a tunnel or diffuser went with it. on the subject of steering wheels, all modern prototypes actually have left or right hand drive. the regulations demand that both lmp1 and lmp2 cars are nominally capable of seating two people. of course in practise the "extra seat" is taken up by the hybrid system in lmp1 and electronics/extra cockpit access in lmp2. however this doesn't change the fact that it would be easy to link the steering wheel to the hog/front axle. edited by jay psi, 12 march 2015 - 09:55 pm.

1 i was very skeptical of this set because i really thought the redesign degraded the looks of the a-model a lot, but after building it i must say this is an excellent set. good job tlg!

1 i'm still not a huge fan of the model, but this is one awesome review. the effort and quality can be clearly seen and i hope you continue making reviews like this

1 great review. i think it look like a great set, both a and b. however the panels are the only thing i would need, but still a great looking set.

1 great review jim.. i have been sitting on the fence about if i will get this set for a while but i saw one built for the first time at a local brick show on the weekend. it definitely looks better in real life than any pics. i have decided to buy one

1 a very professional review and really no stone unturned. but i'm still not going to rush out and buy a copy

0 awesome review jim! i love the pictures. i don't like how lego did this model though. too many compromises edited by omikron, 13 march 2015 - 07:24 am.

1 a great review jim. just finished building this set. a couple of steps required abit of lego stressing to get together when there was an easier way. just made it into rc ( almost finished it in ldd) which was easy to do as it has so much room for nearly any configuration of motors and not have them showing. a great set. edited by jono.rocky, 13 march 2015 - 10:53 am.

1 true, but i must say i like the new colour, very 'fresh' looking compared to the rather dullish regular green. can't wait to build mocs with it.

1 thank you vey much for this review. i do have some questions; 1. what are the white clutches geared into? 2. is the engine geared to one or both drive motors? 3. how well does it go on carpet? 4. can it doze without breaking the blade?

1 excellent review, thanks! what is the cost in us? not released in my area. the shovel is obviously my favorite area, it looks detailed and strong. i love the treads, because i need them to move the 4 x 4 barrels on my super-scaled turbolaser turret. very good pics too. what color are the treads? i never had them. they are plastic or rubber? edited by grand moff viceroy, 03 august 2007 - 12:34 am.

0 ah man...i wanted to review it with mine. oh well. here in the u.s. it cost $150 and has 1355 pieces total. the pins and axles did seem a bit difficult in putting them into place. a problem i have been having is the batterys are done after about 4 hours of play, which i really wish they would last longer :-( . overall it is a stupendous set and it is really nice to see our old friend the studs make a return!

1 thanks for the great review of this set. i've been looking forward to it as well and i am excited about the wireless controls like the dino. i too am curious if this set has been released here in the us. i was told that it was a sept 1 release. i agree about the battery life. my dino set lasted about 4 hours too.

1 thanks for the review! this looks like a great set, and with four motors, two receivers and a remote control i wouldn't say it is overpriced. it is still a lot of money though..... if my scholarship permits it i will seriously consider buying this set.

1 thank you very much for that neat review, ickelpete! *y* your pictures?re very interesting and your video?s really good. that set looks very beautiful to me, a formidable new technic set that quickly?ll turn into an everlasting classic for sure. :'-) i?m just a little sorry for those quality problems.... well, i hope that tlc?ll work on that matter and fix it soon. 8-|

1 nice review, ickelpete. thank you.

1 ickel, thanks for that awesome review. it makes me want to buy this set. i think it'd go just swell with the mobile crane. the fact that it has all the motors and such is awesome, i can foresee using those for a lot of other functions for mocs. and, well i'm a fan of treads. you can never have enough treads :-d hm, would you be able to tell us, perhaps after a test or two what kind of weight this beast can push around? thank you!

1 hi, many thanks for this review, photos and videos. i can't wait to put the hands on mine, since it is already ordered and should arrive before the end of the month. :'-) could you post a scan or photos, from those last pages in the building instructions where the parts included are listed? thanks edited by conchas, 04 august 2007 - 07:19 pm.

1 thank you ickelpete for that great review. i give you two *y* up. i am not a technic fan, but this set definitly looks *sweet* . i see great potential using this set as a model for a smaller dozer for my town/train layout. i really *wub* the crawler tracks they used. i have been thinking about buying the snowmobile for the tracks. but if possible, i just might buy this set instead. i could definitly use the other parts for moc's. model on!!

1 the new small technic sets have incredible functionality for their size, and this one is no exception. with only 106 parts this crane can roll, extend, rotate, lift (and hold in any position) and has working stabilisers! the boom extends the same as the other sets with this boom; simply pull it. it works surprisingly well and due to circular ridges inside the boom the extension (which is just a standard beam) will hold in place. the gear at the back controls the height of the boom. as you can see the boom is only half extended. boom fully extended, half down. the cable is kept in place via two gears and a blue pin, same as the 7905 crane. even under decent weights this works well. the stabilisers however cannot handle much weight once the load is moved off axis. the stablilsers are a very simple but effective design. another shot of the stablilsers. this also shows how far the boom will decend. the boom height mechanism works well also. i love the cab design. overall this is a remarkable achievement for the low price. i bought it for the boom piece as i want to improve the crane that came with 7998 7898 ( :-$ ). i highly recommend it.

-1 very nice review sinner! *y* *wub* so we are getting more and more reviews with figs in it, that?s great! :'-) i actually wanted to skip this technic set, but your review made me think again. i haven?t seen you posting a price, so i will do that for you :-p : it?s (just) 9,99? in germany.

1 really awesome review! i didn't think this set could be that great, but it looks very nice and seems quite cheap. *wub*

1 a very nice review of a very good little set, thanks sinner! *y*

1 alright, so i usually do quick photo reviews when i get new sets. that's what i'll do here, but there's quite a few photos, so i thought i might as well make its own review thread. so, i got the kwik-e-mart by paying just2much on an early ebay copy. i think it's worth it, as this week i'm gonna be super busy, so i was able to build it saturday and stuff. here's my video review, i think it's one of my best: well, let's get onto this photo review. the set is $200 usd with a little over 2100 pieces. the official release is april 15th for vip members, may 1st for everyone else at lego stores. and, if you want full size pictures, check out my flickr by clicking here. the minifigures included are great. you get three exclusive minifigures (one being a completely exclusive character- the first time lego has ever put an exclusive mould in a direct to consumer set), and you get three of the series most popular characters in their normal attire for those who missed out on the first simpsons minifigures series. the kwik-e-mart's exterior is loaded with lots of sticker details. the only printed detail you'll see in the exterior is the dial pad in the phone booth, which has appeared in some other licensed themes since last year. ( ^^^ right here is there the store can be opened- a simple technic pin and receiver keeps it in place and allows for opening and closing) the roof of the store includes the garden shown in the paul mccartney episode. the roof can be slided out/in once you open it with the hinge part. here's a look at the store with the roof removed. the floors are a nice sand blue color, coming with 8x16 thin plates: and, for the interior, from the view of the store opened with the hinges at the back that i mentioned earlier: the left front corner, which includes some arcade machines of bonestorm and great white hunter, an amazingly done buzz cola soda machine, juice machine, the checkout counter, ect: the right front corner, with food aisles, freezers, and a frozen jasper sticker: the back left corner, which includes some nice coffee kettle builds, the donut tray, hotdogs, ect: the right back corner, which has a door leading to a very small hallway that only has a mouse and cheese in it. the hallway leads to the employees only door in the back, and it's very hard to get in the door way (not that there's anything to do inside there): also included is clancy's copcar, which fits three figures: here's a look at the piece list in the instructions, click on each to be lead to an enlarged version of the pic: also included are some awesome printed pieces, and two unprinted coffee cups! honestly, i think this set is perfect. the price is fantastic, and has a great ppp ratio. they really went above and beyond by including snake in this set. i honestly think it's better than the simpsons house in terms of accuracy and the value here- so many cool pieces printed and in exclusive colors. so, that's my quick picture review. hope you guys enjoyed, and i'd love to hear your thoughts!

1 thanks for the review. i can't help but think the minifigures are the weak part of the set. snake and apu are great but the rest.... i don't know. they kinda redundant now. they could at least give us new torso printing, like homer wearing his jacket or bart wearing his blue t-shirt or marge wearing her coat. or, as i said in the discussion thread, i'd have included jasper in cmf series 2 and a frozen version here. overall, the set looks kinda smaller than what i thought. (snake's bag needed a $ symbol printed, because it looks like he is stealing gargabe ) pretty good review overall

1 hello everyone. excellent review! english is not my native language, but i want to express my opinion. simpsons house was the first of its kind, and i can say without exaggeration that this is the most impressive set that i'm going (my collection http://brickset.com/sets/ownedby-celeb ). i look at the video from the kwik-e-mart, and is difficult to say how good it is compared with the house. the main disadvantages that i said to myself, is this: build the walls of the large panels, next is access to the roof (gray parts in front of the back door (i think they represent the stairs)) is not on the level with doors on the roof and when you open them, you can see the white block is openly trash, my points of view. boxes on the left of go to the store and powersauce box, i want see make real and not just a cube, f.e. such as in the unreleased star wars set. about minifigures, i fully agree with robert8. two more of the same homer, marge and bart?! personally, i put my set as a scene and all the replays minifigure are inside the house that was not identical characters next and also absolutely terrible bart`s accessory this set is made parking for bikes and it looks very cool. but damn, it is hoped to see the bart or lisa's bike, instead of useless balloons with paint. the walls are made with convex inside panels, why so? can anyone know? have not seen any pictures with such walls in tv show. why did not they turn? i personally really like how realized roof, but my brother says that it is terrible :) garden could do more in the series there were almost jungle i do not know how to be considered here, maybe anyone can express any opinion or idea? i look at the simpsons house, and then look at the photo of this e-mart. i can not understand, in the house we have a garage, two floors, cool floor, a lot of furniture, all the rooms and walls, collected from cubes, many additional accessories. and where is all this detail here? it looks much smaller (maybe even poorer). if they still will release next year comic book store, it will be even less? of course it is difficult to estimate without seeing it live, we have it will be sold only in may. at first sight it does not look so impressive as the house. can certainly the case in the limit on the amount of detail, but why it was impossible to add $ 50 to the cost and make jasper, the more detailed the roof, the walls of the smaller elements, that it was not convex. sad. thanks all for attention. edited by celeb, 13 april 2015 - 05:10 am.

1 can you post a pic of it next to the simpsons house? just curious about size comparisons...

1 great review!! thanks for paying a little extra to get it now and review it for us!!! you must be a youngin'...those phone booths thingys are called "pay phones" :) j/j they're tough to find nowadays.

1 incredible set, thanks for the pics! so many details and unique prints and colors. i'm not that into the simpsons but definitely a top tier set.

-1 i have sooo mixed feeling about that... i loved the simpsons house (save for the terrible wall in the homer and marge's room), but this so far is inferior in almost every aspect. the walls made of panels is a bummer. i expect a d2c set to be better that this. 60+ stickers? the same thing. same price for less bricks and smaller build then the house. strange coloured bricks on the outside wall (some ugly mix of yellow + tan) panels again with their fronts facing towards the inside of the shop so we and up with those squares all around. the walls are yellow, this was so nice, lost opportunity to make it in some other less common colour. then again the set overall looks is good. the roof is a nice detail. the shop looks actually like a real one, not just an approximation of one. the roof tiles are in dark orange - we got new/rare colour here the car looks interesting to build (just like the pink one from the house) lots of nice references to the show it's the simpsons! definitely a must buy... but for a discounted price. i'll try to find one with maybe damaged box or after-display copy. edited by mestari, 14 april 2015 - 01:15 pm.

-1 that's actually not bad sizing, imo. sure, it looks like you get a lot more with the house, but the kwik-e-mart has a lot more of those little references that make it simpsons. i agree with some of the complaining; a real jasper behind a trans-blue panel would have been cool. you could always bulk up the roof with more foliage... i think it has a great foundation as a set, but could do with a few mods to make it better. thanks for the pictures; i greatly appreciate being able to see reviews like this before dropping $200 on a lego set.

1 great review just2good, honestly i love this set lots of great details and references.

-1 one thing that may justify the price: it has 527 different parts (if i counted correctly). i alway heard the more different parts the more difficult the set is to produce. the simpsons house already had an astonishig amount of different pieces, but this one is even more extreme...

1 i like this set a lot better than the simpsons house, but 60+ stickers is just incredibly disappointing. it seems quite a few of them could have been printed parts

1 great review.

1 nice review, i'm building it (need to finish it, but i'm at work right now) with the printed piece, you forgot to show the chocolat milk 1x1 brick, which is exclusive to this set yet (it isn't referenced on bricklink yet, only the blue one) the set is really fun to build, with a lot of little pieces for the fridges. i haven't put the stickers yet, will see the final product to put the essentials ones

1 great review of a classic set. *y*

1 due to a larger bl order in the u.s. i couldn?t resist to add two hopper waggons to my train layout. here?s a review of this fantastic set. the box. well, there?s nothing really special about it. the open box with three polybags. note, that there are only three different colors used in that set (actually there are 4, but you can?t see the dark grey ones). great color composition by the way. *wub* and - no stickers !!! - :-d oooops - i opened the bags too fast. help me, i?m drowning! *sing* not following the instructions, i built the wheels first to get the larger pieces out of the way. keep on rolling. this is the load of the hopper waggon. 11 round bricks altogether. when i opened the set, i was curious if it was a new colored set or an old one. luckily enough it was an old one, with old dark grey. i don?t know if tlc ever produced this set with bley. from the following pic you can clearly see, that the set is an old one. look at these slope bricks. see what i mean? all bricks are looking exactly the same! buy a set today means get at least three different textures on the slopes and maybe even more shades of tan. :-x >:-( i have said that in many other threads here and i?m saying it again: back to the roots, lego! you were able to produce good quality. show us you can still do it! *sad* but now to the building. it?s a 6 x 24 train base plate you?re building on. did i say i liked the colors? :-d this is the mechanism to unload the waggon. built in the waggon with open gates... ... and with closed ones. almost done. this is the first time, i realized that minifigs actually can step on those ladders. :-$ a short lift and the wheels are fixed. this darn mechanism! wait, i?m coming with my monkey wrench! >:-) who opened that door again? do i have to do it all on my own? :'-( finally the work is done. now have a brake. one shot from the front/back. you can see the car is really huge! 8-? i put it behind the red car of the 4512. that sure looked very strange. *wacko* the set fits a lot better to the other cars of the "my own train" theme than to the older ones. the score: brick selection: 10/10 excellent color and brick selection (these were the days...) playability: 9/10 great unloading mechanism price/piece count ratio: 8/10 at peeron it says 20$, i got it for 39,95$ -> 30?/228 bricks. not really cheap, but worth every cent! :-) overall rating: 9/10 and a definity "must buy" for rolling stock lovers. sad enough it?s not available on s@h any more. but there are still sets on bl and ebay. that?s for now folks, thank you for reading. i have some job to do...

1 great review of a great set! *wub* i look forward to more!

1 *wub* *wub* *wub* *wub* *wub* holodoc, i seriously have some love for your review!! you're in it and using a fabuland wrench!!! such a clever review with a great sense of humor! i really liked this train set and it adds so much to a train layout, especially when you buy multiples. tlc is throwing away a potential gold mine by discontinuing this line. :'-( it is also nice to see those beautiful consistent slopes in that picture. it really is sad that tlc is letting quality slip. they don't seem to be responding to the issue they way they did the bley/frown fiasco. perhaps we afol need to make more of a stink! to the embassy!!! >:-( again great job holodoc and thanks for sharing *sweet* *y* what an excellent and fun review!!

0 thank you guys for your nice reply. :'-) i have to add two pics of my freight train showing a bit more clearly what the size matter is about: this is what it looks like when you put the hopper waggon right behind the red car of 4512. it looks a lot better without the red car! i had a lot of fun with this review and i will add another one (look at the 2nd pic ;-) ) the next days. stay tuned!

1 great review! i loved the pic of your sigfig buried under legos :-d it's too bad lego did not continue to make more of this style of set.

1 you've done it again. *yoda* ! great reveiw. i really like this set, but in my opinon, $50 is steep considering i won't actually 'play' with it. i mean, half of it is a track for peat sake! ill eventually get it for the mrs. puff figure, though. *y*

1 i like this one better than the other one for parts and such, plus i'm generally a sucker for any different minifig, but yeah, that price is steep. great review though!

1 another great review, thanks *yoda*! man, those smooth slopes really look like crap when on a roof :-| that was the whole reason they had texture in the first place... |-/ i'll never liked those, they feel so cheap! the new sb head is great, and can mrs. puff's legs move? i just ask since her feet are separate, and in figs where the legs can't move, they're usually one piece at the bottom to keep them from breaking off. the set looks great, and seems to have a lot of playability

1 thank you *yoda* for strike 2! it?s sb again. |-/ sticker alarm! :-x but this set is better than chum bucket. there are far more interesting parts if you don?t like sb. especially the light house and the little hut with the wooden pontoon. *y* and yet again another set with smooth slopes and rough ones... too bad, too bad. >:-( >:-( >:-( if i just knew the person who is responsible for that... >:-)

1 nice review mate, the set look's great and a real must for all those sb fan's out there. the whole set scream playability that's for sure, which is great because let's be honest their's gonna be alot of kid's and *yoda* out their playing with it :-p x-d ;-) . geezzzzz what is it with all those bloody stikers? this set would be soooooo much better with printed piece's instead of those, still once your over that at least the rest is ok. am i the only one who thinks mrs puff kinda look's like a kinder egg toy? their's nothing wrong with that mind you (yes i have a kinder problem x-d ) just seem's strange to me.

1 maybe mrs puff has a nice toy inside x-d i like this review. the lighthouse part and the school are nice enough for other towns. and the figs are nice, even mrs puffs 2 pieces you can't use for other things. :-) pity that it's 50 dollars/+/- 60 euro. for half price i would think about it.

0 it looks like a good set but i would rather get the neighborhood one.

1 the set, and the other designer sets that came out with it (especially 4888) are incredibly well designed sets. i wish lego would go back to doing sets like these as i loved the multitude of instructions and ideas. the last batch of creator sets had zero ideas, even though i know several were made. :'-( anyway, less whining, more review. the lion is the main model. his mouth doesn't fully close, but it does open more. the head works well from most angles. i love the dark orange bricks; great for rust... he is quite solid, but the joints take the weight well. the neck goes side to side and rotates, but doesn't go up and down. the body is built in two parts and pinned in the middle. with what is left you can make what i think is a hyena, a silly plant moc... ...and what i believe is a vulture. there are also instructions for a few other models including a bat, boar and a snake... which i quite like. he can be built at the same time as... ...this cute little lizard. overall this is a great set with an excellent blend of colours and pieces. i wanted it for steampunk potentials. *sweet* i hope you liked the review. till next time....

1 great review as always! *y* lego is timeless, so there is no such thing as an old set. i never build brick monsters/creatures, but this set had such a nice assortment of parts that i had to pick a couple up as they weren't clearancing out on shop @ home. i absolutely love dark orange and tan, so it was an automatic win. i love the use of "familiar characters" in the review, i can almost hear hinckley screaming, "my megabloks!" :-p you sort of look like you're planning some vulture stew though. might have to start a new challenge to determine a winner there. sinner and his big pot o' doom vs giant vulture! only thing is, does everything horrify the mrs? she seems perpetually shocked and/or dismayed at the goings on here. now that i think about it, i can see why. i'm occasionally shocked and/or dismayed 8-? brick built beasties on! *y*

0 thank you for the nice review, sinner! i also bought this set but in combination with 4883 when it was on sale (50% - hurray!) at s@h. i made a short review of 4883 but wasn?t really sure what to tell about 4884. so i?m glad you did that for me. :-d i have different feelings about this set. on the one hand i love the lion. he is really impressive (even my wife -not known for being lego enthusiastic- asked me, if there were more animals of this kind). the lion is - restricted - poseable and the colors used are fantastic. *wub* 3 models can be built simultaneously - that?s great! on the other hand i still don?t know what to do with these rotation joints. *wacko* and the other models are somehow disappointing compared to the lion. i seem to have missed the little lizard. :-$ i put it on my "to do-list". like all the creator sets: great parts pack - but wait until they get on sale! x-d for me - i had a lot more fun with 4883. indeed: roarrrr on! ;-)

1 thanks for the review! i really like this set. i love the acu minifigures and the dinosaur is really nice. i think the helicopter has great potential for a shield helicopter. only suggestion is that some of your pictures are a little bit dark.

0 i'm pleased to see that this is available for purchase, at least in some parts of the world, rather than only being available with the jw game. nice review, i'll going to scope out whether toys r us in sweden is carrying them, although i've never seen polybags in there before.

0 nice review! i really hope its avaliable for sale in the us.

0 great review man, really well written and structured. hoping to go on a hunt and see if this is available in uk stores soon.

0 great review! but spoiler i didn't see or even hear mentioned a galliminus or any sort of dino trap in the movie. i wonder where this design came from!

1 lego 31036 creator toy and grocery shop thanks to eurobricks for making this review possible! for years, lego has offered a house of some sort in the creator line each year - with the standard creator 3-in-1 instructions, that's given us a very wide variety of housing. in 2014, they added a business option with their 31026 bike shop and cafe set. this continues into this year's toy and grocery shop set. these shops are smaller than the very detailed modular buildings, but that should help them fit in better with the other city sets, and this also lets them get into more kids' cities with their lower pricetag. name: toy and grocery shop set number: 31036 pieces: 466 price: $39.99 minifigs: 2 theme: creator year of release: 2015 links: bricklink peeron brickset the box the front of the box shows the "a" version model out of the three, plus insets of the b and c versions. i like the sorta-european looking backdrop; it goes well with the styling of the buildings. interestingly, the main model is shown opened up for play, while the two insets show those versions folded. the box top on the top of the box, lego helpfully shows that with 3 of these sets, you can make a whole street. the box back on the back, you get to again see all three versions together, but this time, folded. it's a little creepy though with those clones running around :) the manuals yep, three actual, printed manuals. there's nothing indicating them as being a, b, and c models, but it's pretty obvious looking at the designs which is the "main" model and which are the alternates. the contents bags of parts and two plates. nothing terribly exciting to see here.... the minifigs nothing new here, but two nice figs none-the-less. well, bricklink does say that both figs are unique to this set, but there's not any new parts to them. the closest thing to rare is the female head - it's only in this set, 2013's dragon mountain castle set, a uk store grand opening set, and one of the 2014 holiday freebie sets. the faces aren't that unique, but i guess this exact combo of two faces on the head is. i love the kid torso with the spaceman on it. the minifig backs no back printing on anything here except for an alternate female face. sorry. i do like that her two faces are so different though. that's much better than when a head has a "scared" and a "more scared" face. the "c" build enough with the basics; let's build. i'm going to review them in the same order i built them, backwards. since you can tell immediately looking at the 3 designs that they're going to use different numbers of pieces and so forth, i figured i'd build the smallest first lest it seem like a letdown. all three have some basic similarities - the two plates are hinged to give a building that opens for play. they also do have interiors, which you can see starting to form here. the "c" build, front it's a pretty quick build, so it's done already. here's the front of the building with it opened up. like this, it appears to be two separate stores, a newsstand and some sort of shop you can enter. all the printed tiles help give the newsstand a detailed appearance, but i'm not sure why they've got a $100 bill lying on the ledge... the "c" build, rear from the back side, the interiors are pretty plain. the shop half has a plant in a jar and a weird chair, and the newsstand just has a register. the "c" build, sides here's the two sides of the folded building. on the hinge side, there's a bunch of windows in a disjointed wall with random colors. on the other, why did they put in a huge window when the set does include a trans-clear door that could have gone there? and you get a small patch of plants, like so many sets seem to have these days. the "c" build, extras that's a lot of leftovers there. and not just little stuff - multiple doors, stairs, etc. and unused sand green is always a little sad.... the "b" build, 1 a pretty similar start, with the hinge and little garden and some tiles along the ground. the "b" build, 2 now we see a big windowed wall, some details like lights, and how it has the usual alternate model "weird part usage" - like a 1x4 brick with side studs being used over the doorway, even though those side studs will not get used. the "b" build, front the finished building gives us a nice little post office, with a letter-carrying bird on the roof. hope that's not their normal method of delivery! something about the colors just doesn't work for me though. the combo of white / light grey / dark grey / black / sand green plus tan is just too much. the tan window and door frames i don't like. the "b" build, inside on the inside, things are weird. the counter on the left is ok, but the light above the door (with a yellow clip? ugly!) is too big, and everything else over there by the door doesn't make much sense either. the "b" build, sides i like the front side here, except the colors are still too much. the bench, greenery, mailbox on the corner, and streetlight are all nice. the boy is a little creepy though - binoculars in hand plus a telescope on the roof of the post office? why? the hinge side shows more of the weird colors you get in the wall, but that's going to be hidden when the set is open. plus we even see that on big modulars at times, so it's not so terrible. the "b" build, leftovers again, a lot of leftover parts. it's obvious this was another alternate, but it'd be nice to see more of them used to make a bigger building. but let's move on to the model that does use them all... the "a" build, 1 the first half starts like this. maybe it's just my bias, but it already feels like a more detailed build. bottles on the wall, the yellow and red awning over the window, etc. the "a" build, 2 the other half starts off with detailed work too. i think that's a red vending machine. the stairs are also very solidly built. i also appreciate the effort to get that diagonal base where a door will be - it's such a nice touch to have sections of a building that aren't right angles. the "a" build, 3 not too much has been added, but i wanted to showcase the tiny toys before they get hidden by a wall. that robot and train are just fantastic little micro builds. the "a" build, 4 things are coming together quickly. the walls, windows, and doors get the first floor nearly done. i'm still not big on the sand green and tan combo, but i do really like the red and yellow awnings. the "a" build, 5 it appears the shop owner lives upstairs, since we've got a bedroom forming here. the bed is a little plain, but the table and lamp on the other half are great. and my big fingers did not like putting all those railings on the balcony, with the telescope posts and tile tops. knocked quite a few off before i got them all done. the "a" build, front and it's done. all the details make this set really feel like a mini-modular. the roofline has great greebling, and the shop contents, and on and on. it's not perfect though. the tiny car above the toy store door isn't nearly as good as the toys inside. and the kid's yellow scooter? the wheels aren't even on the ground, much less able to roll. the scooter looks decent though, so that counts for something. well, at least as long as you are at this angle, since the boy's only got 1 foot on the 1 stud wide scooter. the "a" build, inside most of the interior has been seen already. the roof though does a nice job of being interesting for a roof. a skylight, the edge rails, etc. and you can see there's not much "wrong color" in the walls. the "a" model, sides an interesting building when folded up. very tall and skinny. you can tell it's not really meant to be displayed this way - it's meant to be open. the good - lots! i like the awning, the diagonal door, the flowerbox under the upper window, the folding gate on the balcony that lets it be used in open or closed mode, and the green / white / blue colors. the bad - well, the stairs end short of the upper door, i still don't really like the tan doorframes (i think black would have been better), and why don't the upper floors match up in size? the "a" model, leftovers ah, that's more like it. just a few small pieces left as spares. the errors you might have to click through to the full-size versions, but i did catch a few weird errors in the manuals. first, in the photo of the newsstand, the map in the front corner is on there sideways. the map does have a clear north arrow printed on it. on the second image, the boy's feet are hanging off the edge. just unusual to see an alignment error in the manual like that. the comparison here are this set and the modular detective office side by side. there's a huge difference - as you'd expect. but is the difference more than you'd expect? this set is 466 parts, $40. the do is 2262 pieces and $160. 5 times the parts, 4 times the price. looking at them side by side, i'd expect a bigger difference in both. the conclusion so, what's my conclusion on this model? i love the main model, but the alternates are meh. it's a nice set for someone looking for a town building other than police and fire stations, but who isn't ready to move to the modular line. compared to the modulars though, it seems overpriced. part of that is because the huge modulars are actually a great deal compared to other lego sets. i'm also a little surprised that it's so small, when you compare it to the city sets like a police station. those are generally designed with much more open space, letting them be more of a playset. this one is small and cramped, so it'd be tougher to play in. it's not really a city set though. the ratings value: 7/10 - it's under the 10 cents a part mark, but that's largely due to having a ton of tiny parts. all those flowers and decorative 1x1 round studs add up quickly! design: 7/10 - good and bad on the colors, and there's a big difference between the quality of the main vs alternate models. having so many leftover pieces is one thing when the creator set makes 3 very different models (ie a boat, plane, and truck). when it's 3 buildings, it seems wasteful to have so many parts leftover. minifigs: 6/10 - i'm not sure they both fit the set. i suppose the boy is going to the toy store and the woman is going to the grocery? but there's no storekeeper in either. the woman doesn't look like a storekeeper to me, so that's why i assume she's another shopper. i love the boy, but the woman is just so-so - except that i do appreciate the head having two very different expressions. but again, that doesn't fit the set. i can't see her scared face being used. playability: 6/10 - the shops are detailed with registers and so forth, but it's all so tiny it'd be hard to play with the figs in it. parts: 9/10 - tons of windows and doors, plus nice sand green bricks. but some things (the large blue curves used on the roof for example) are weirdly specialized and would be hard to use in another building design. overall: 7/10 - i'd recommend doing what i did - build the alternates first, then the main since that's how you'll want to leave it. i'd really like to see the price a little lower compared to other sets (again, the part count is inflated due to so many tiny parts) and the finished building is tiny, but it's loaded with neat details.

0 nice review mostlytechnic. i particularly like the use of grey background surface for the pictures. it somehow makes the building stand out more. good job!

-1 a terrific, very comprehensive review - but i'm not at all impressed with this set. it feels like a mishmash of bricks with no clear design aesthetic and as such blatantly underdeveloped (i.e. designed to hit a price/brick count point rather than provide a solid set in the creator town tradition). compared to other creator sets at this price point (31025 - mountain hut, for example) it feels utterly uninspired and ugly. edited by johnny6666, 04 may 2015 - 10:02 am.

0 thanks 'mostlytechnic' for this review, i only brought this set to continue the shop series from creator. in my opinion it's only half as good as the bike shop/cafe one. plus it doesn't fit the same as that pair of shops, oh well maybe next year lego creator will have a better one. brick on review on 'mostlytechnic' !

0 this seems like half of a set compared to the previous bike shop/cafe. as i like many of the elements, i will probably buy a second one and build a mirror image version (making one entirely a toy shop and the other a book store/news stand) and adjust the sidewalks to work with the previous model. then i think they will work well together. i remember a little area in copenhagen that had this sort of architecture. i would hope the subsequent models are better deigned to create more complex alternatives, but these are both good starting points for original or enhanced models.

1 as a fan of creator houses, i really want to like this set. however, i think that creator houses have long filled a niche that's neglected elsewhere: residential houses. we haven't had a larger residential house since 2013; i'm not sure if these sets have anything to do with that, but it seems like they may be the replacement for larger houses. and i'd much rather have a larger house set than a set like this. i also agree with many others here; something about it just feels incomplete. i think that the various city business buildings we've gotten in recent years (including those in this year's city square--which is much more expensive than this, but also contains much more) make for better buildings at this scale.

1 thanks andy_0306uk, your very clever strategic decision to serve us with blurry pictures allowed me to glance at this review without ruinating that whole wonderful advent surprise too much.... :-p *y* but although i loved the last year?s one, i think they could do another theme (or perhaps even two calendars), because right now castle?s pretty hot imo.

1 informative review, thanks! *y* as usual, it makes a fairly good parts pack. wish i could pick up a few on deep discount, but at full price one is fine. i do like the 'stewards' and some of the workmen. overall, i think i'm looking more forward to the belville calendar, just for it's assortment of unusual parts. ugh. belville. still, parts are parts, and it's got some. phoinix summed up one of the most common complaints i hear about all of the lines in 3 simple words ... "no girls....again!" good job, now get lego to listen. ;-)

0 whoa! it's out already! *places order* i guess i should thank you andy, because i might have missed this one just like i missed last year's calendar. now all i have to do is wait two weeks and pick it up at the post office across the border.

0 i've never been fond of these sets, but still buy them every year because my daughters like them. i am, however, looking forward to the belville advent calendar, which likely will have some parts that usually are quite hard to get in it. my girls will love it, and i love all the belville parts. http://shop.lego.com/product/?p=7600 if anyone has pics of what is contained in this set i would love to see them.

0 phoinix, on sep 13 2007, 03:18 pm, said: no girls....again! and no santa? whats up with that? sure there are many nice pieces to give life to every city layout.. i would love something more simple a girl taking her dog for a walk a boy on a bicycle simpler things...not all the workmen again! i agree, a girl with a dog or a boy with bicycle in a small set would be so nice and strange enough so difficult for tlc. nice review.

-1 thanks andy for the review! i prefer the city advent calendar 2006 a lot! those mini sets are nor good for me! the "road subtheme" sets are nice, but the others, not so good! the 05 version waf ok, the 06 version was better, with bigger sets, and more building ones! and the 07 is poor! it's just 2-3 pieces to put together on 2x4 plates... where are the gardening accessories? where are some nice small constructions that you can put in your layout like a mailbox or an orodator? and the chrismas tree looks :-x imo! and no santa... *y* for andy *n* for this calendar

0 i'm a big fan of anime and have watched some mechas like full metal panic, neon evangelion: genesis (it is a mecha!) and chobits (well... she is a robot...), so i was curious to see what this new exo force line was all about. the colorful sets and manga-like characters didn't persuade me right away, but the urgent need for a couple of white 3x3 wing plates made me purchase this little thing. it cost me 70 dkr as you can see on the box. this is 9.30 euro, or about the same an american has to pay for the new republic cruiser. pretty expensive for so few pieces (90 + a spare technic pin) the box an action-packed box with one of the sides being oddly empty except from the lego-logo. what's inside there is a small building instruction, two polybags (no bag building here) and a sticker sheet with alarmingly many stickers. the build it takes so little time to build this set that i didn't get to take any pictures of the process. every step was accompanied by an element description although i doubt most of you will need that with so few pieces to keep track on. most of the dark green bricks have a sticker - even the slopes where the rough surface makes stickers fall off easily! there should also have been a sticker on the windshield, but i wanted to keep that piece clean for better usage later. (i'm one of those who keeps stickers on the bricks) the model you want to see this model from the front, as the back is pretty much neglected there isn't much for the pilot to grab a hold on either. he is pretty much a sitting duck up there with the screen giving him only partial cover. there is a huge wrench next to him which kind of symbolizes the crudeness of the mech. the set isn't called "cyclone defender" for nothing. the right arm might hold an ordinary light assault riffle, but the other has a spinning disc with samurai swords which you can turn with the yellow knob on the backside. those of you who have seen robot wars might remember the incredible power of this melee weapon from a robot named hypnodisc. it would have been nice had there been a pull-back motor to power the disc (i'm sure lego has a lot of these in stock), but the simple mechanism still works reasonably well. the riffle comes off and a pin makes it easy to hold with the hand, but the disc is fixed to the arm. it is also a problem that the swords get misaligned quickly during play. the minifig i really like this minifig because of the neat idea with an expression on each side that lego has made a standard for exo force. posability most mech-moc'ers show off their creations using gundam-like poses. with two joints per leg (one being the ankles) and one for an arm i thought of some less serious poses: crawling (silent like a ninja!): belly gliding: kick off!; upside down: final rating i have to disappoint you here. this is my first set in this line and i have absolutely no idea of how good it is. the last robot i bought was the awesome 6889 spyrius recon robot for the same price, but it is in a completely different genre. the set had what i expected (two white wings) and is as such a no-nonsense set. i guess it would be of more use if you have some more exo force, which i don't. 6/10 ups: has great minifig, weapons and is easy to build. downs: crude design and a bit too expensive for what you get. (brickshelf gallery)

0 9.30 euro is msrp here in denmark. 7 euro would have resulted in a nicer reception from my part, but the strong marked position of lego in its homeland together with the general high prices (because some of us are supposedly rich...) makes the prices less bearable. it is funny you should mention germany. i thought the prices for lego were even higher there! i'm sure i paid more than msrp last time i bought lego from from your country. on the other hand. the last thing i bought was the 5521 model team sea jet from 1993!

1 i have 2 of these guys. :-d it's awesome, only cost me 13 bucks nz, for a comparison, the castle crossbow attack set costs $10 nz. for the win! did i read this wrong? you paid about the same price as the republic cruiser??! the republic cruiser costs $200 nz, and the cyclone defencer costs $13. i must have read that wrong... *wacko*

1 nice review and a nice set. thanks for taking the time. i'll want to pick this guy up.

1 great review lasse d. a definite two *y* up. i bought this set for the swing-wing concept. i was very curious what tlc's design was like. i have been working on modifying it just a little to look more like the f-14. so far i have completed the back section, but i need to finish the cockpit. overall this is a great set. i *wub* tlc's swing-wing concept. model on!!

1 this is a really great set! when i first saw it i thought "oh a silly small plane who needs that" and then i got it and i am very happy that i did! this is one of the best designed lego creator sets! and it was designed by the designer of the cafe-corner!!!!

1 a fine set, a great review and good additional pictures. thanks lasse d and sinner. teamwork on! *y*

0 thank you sinner for bringing the pictures of the hovercraft. i think it is a really cool model, but the steering wheel doen't work too well. it doesn't turn easilly all the way around and when the craft turns, it doesn't stay stable on the three wheels because the front wheel turns quite alot into the opposite side. now to the third model! this is quite a basic helicopter with the functionality of having the rotors turning. it doesn't use that many of the bricks and doesn't even have a landing gear. i have a question to all of you. as you can see, i prefer to show one or two large pictures and have the rest as clickable thumbnails. most people use only the relatively big (typically 640x480) pictures so that you don't have to follow links. what do you prefer? it is no problem for me to do it the other way, but i would like to know if you have any preferences.

1 ?34.99 is not too shabby. the big guy itself is nice, but the gem of the set is the mech. really nice mech i must say! great for posing. the mini figs suprisingly nice little build/vehicle. never seen this element before....its probably nothing new though, lol. no articulation of the legs? nooooooo! phew! the front two legs do articulate. would of been bad if they didnt. overall, i give the set 7.8/10. not the best, but its actually quite nice, and the yellow mech is awesome. if it was him on his own, then 9.4/10! cheers

1 it is no secret that marvel is one of the most successful companies right now. from the avengers to the x-men and down to even the most obscure characters like ant-man, every one of their movies has been a big hit until now. the latest marvel movie, fant4stic, was released last month and while i have not seen it yet, i'm sure it's just as great as their other movies. i mean, it has the word "fantastic" in the title after all! and being the smart business that they are, the lego company decided to get in on the hype early and capitalize on this movie's undoubtful success two years in advance by making a set featuring fant4stic's main villain, dr. doom. now that's what i call forward thinking! but did they do a good job with it or were they being overhasty? let's find out! set

swing into the daily bugle and stop dr. doom! dr. doom and his henchman beetle are attacking the daily bugle in their speedy jet to steal spider-man's secret identity. it's up to spider-man and nova to swing in and stop them! trigger the daily bugle's explosion functions to cause destruction as the jet fires missiles! stop dr. doom from hitching the jet's anchor hook to the safe with spider-man's secret inside! knock beetle off the building with the swinging web attack and drop dr. doom inside with the rooftop trapdoor! then fly nova in through the broken window with the dumpster catapult function and send those villains back to where they came from. includes spider-man, nova, dr. doom, beetle and j. jonah jameson with accessories and weapons. the first thing that comes to mind after reading this description is: wow, that's a lot of tms! anyway, here are some resource links for this set: brickset bricklink rebrickable the box since this set is based on the ultimate spider-man cartoon, the box has the usual usm design with the red marvel super heroes background, an illustration of spidey in the upper right corner, and the usm logo in the lower right. as usual, there is a minifig line up in the lower left, and since this was before the terrible redesign, you can see the full body of the minifigs. i really miss this type of line up. there is quite a lot going on here: doctor doom attacking the daily bugle in his jet while simultaneously reaching for j. jonah jameson below with his jet's claw, spider-man (reluctantly) swings in to save him, while nova fights off the beetle. it's a pretty cool scene, even though it's not very accurate to the show. in "beetle mania", the episode that this set is based on, the beetle was indeed out to kill jjj, but it was in order to stop him from exposing his identity, not spider-man's (although spidey was next on jjj's list). and while he is a recurring villain on the show, doctor doom had nothing to do with this plot and didn't even appear in the episode aside from a brief cameo. it's awesome that they included him anyway, though, so i'm not gonna complain. note that the tower is so tall that it wraps around the top of the box. there, you can also see a scale reference with the spider-man minifig. on the back of the box, you can see the interior of the bugle and all of its play features which there are quite a few of since this is a playset. it's all illustrated pretty well, although lego's choice of sound effects is still a mystery to me. i don't get why they don't go for spider-man's signature "fwip!" instead of "fazzing!" and i didn't know that a breaking window made the sound "btoom!" but i digress. contents inside the box you will find three instruction booklets (one smaller than the others), a comic book, a fairly large sticker sheet, five numbered bags, and two loose pieces: a white string piece and a gray 16x8 plate. there aren't really any notable pieces and nobody cares about the comic bock (no offense to the artist), so lets get right to the instructions. they are pretty straight forward and easy to follow. some of the pages have a ghostly image of spidey, nova, and dr. doom in the top right corner which is fitting since these are all minifigs that appear in this set (which is strangely not something that can be said for many other super heroes instructions with this type of artwork). minifigures as with most super heroes sets, most people will get this set mainly for the minifigs, so without further ado, let's talk about them. spider-man is the same old bootless one you get in almost every usm set. not much to say about him. some might complain that we don't get spidey's alter ego peter parker in this set, but in the usm cartoon, mj is actually the one who works at the daily bugle, not peter. curse the creators of this cartoon for ruining our chances of getting a new peter parker minifig by trying to mix things up. next we get j. jonah jameson. he appeared in a spider-man 2 set before, but this is a complete redesign. he now has a blue suit with a red tie, a unique face print, and that combed-back hair in dark gray. this new hairpiece doesn't suit him at all and the old flat top hair was perfect for him in my opinion, so i don't know why they changed it. the good thing about this change, however, is the fact that this piece is exclusive to this set in that color. nova on the other hand is spot-on. he comes with a new helmet mold and some nice torso printing. however, he, too, is missing his boots. tlc should have started making dual-colored legs a long time ago. here are some reference images to compare them to. okay, so jjj's hair may not be completely black in the show, but i still think they should have given his minifig a black hairpiece. his suit is also not quite the right color. he rarely appears in person in the show (including the episode this set is based on) and is usually seen on screens around new york, so this is the best picture of him i could find. i guess i should be happy they included a minifig of him at all. in the episode, it was actually mary jane who was at the bugle during beetle's attack, so it would have made more sense to include her, but we got her in the spider-copter set one year later, so that's ok. all three of them have back printing. in jjj's case i'm using that term loosely since it is only comprised of two lines, but it's nice that they went through the trouble of adding them. both jjj and nova come with angry alternate faces. it almost looks like they're trying to out-angry each other. who do you think looks angrier? let me know in the comments section below. now let's talk about the bad guys. even though he would be better off in a fantastic four set, it's great to finally get victor van doom, one of the greatest marvel villains ever and in comics in general. he comes with a dark green hood which was new and exclusive in that color at the time, and he is the only minifig in this set that has leg printing. beetle is a regular minifig with wings. the metallic printing on his face and torso is pretty nice, but i wish it would have continued onto his legs as well. the beetle looks quite accurate to his on-screen counterpart. the only thing that could have improved him is a new helmet mold with pointy eyebrows/antennae. doctor doom, however, looks nothing like he does in the movie. i just don't understand how lego could have messed him up so badly. maybe they were working off of early concept art or something. here is a back view of doom and beetle. beetle would be a pretty boring minifig if it wasn't for his wings which are awesome with their holographic texture. they are so mesmerizing, i could look at those things all day. this piece also appeared in trans. light green in the galaxy squad sets which came out at the same time. here they are without their gear. as you can see, they both have back printing as well. and no, doctor doom does not come with an alternate facial expression, which is fine since you can't see much of his expressions due to his mask anyway. here's a look at dr. doom and nova without their headgear. some say that doom's face looks too cartoony, but i think it looks fine. nova is wearing stylish goggles as a way of explaining his white eyes. it's a far better explanation than the bat-sweatband. they did the same thing with the masked wolverine later. here are all the figs with their accessories. jjj comes with a camera so that he can take "more pictures of spider-man!" beetle comes with one of those overused adu guns which is a very poor representation of his wrist-mounted blasters. i hate to say it, but even those bulky new stud shooters would have been a better representation of his weapons. spidey comes with his usual string of webbing and nova comes with some iron man style translucent studs. the weird thing is that they are red while his powers have a blue glow in the show. doctor doom sadly doesn't get any accessories, but who needs weapons when you have a jet with a claw and flick-fire missiles. the build the first bag contains spider-man, a brick separator, and the parts to build the ground floor of the dbc building. after a quick and straight-forward build, you get this. the dumpster and street lamp are separate from the building and since the lamp post is not built onto any baseplate and is quite top-heavy, it gets knocked over pretty easily. maybe it's meant to be that way, but i would have preferred it if you could stick it onto the baseplate of the building on which there is unfortunately not enough space to do so. as you would expect, the second bag has the parts for the first floor of the building. this is also the bag that contains beetle. after another fairly simple build, you'll find yourself with a two story building with a spiderweb one side and a fire escape on the other. however, you have to apply three stickers during this section of the build which is never fun. can you guess what's in bag number 3? yup, the second floor of the building. you don't need superpowers to predict that one. also, this bag contains nova and jameson. the build of this section is a bit repetitive since the second floor is mostly the same as the first and it takes slightly longer to build since you have to build the rooftop as well. also, in addition to the two window stickers you have to apply ten 2x2 tile stickers! trying to do this without having any of them being crooked is a real pain in the megablocks. the next bag contains doctor doom and the cockpit of his jet. doom's cape is in the usual square white box and the string for the claw is folded up in a piece of tape. here's what you get at the end of this section. looks more like an escape pod than a jet at this point. the final bag is the smallest as it only includes the few parts needed to finish the doom jet. once you build the wings and tail, you stick them onto the cockpit via technic pins and you're done. spare parts these are the parts that are left over after the build. there is the brick separator of course, an extra antenna, and the usual little bits and bops. what's really awesome, though, is that they give you an extra pair of beetle's wings! considering what a neat piece this is and that this is the only set in which it comes in trans-black make this a very welcome spare that you can use in your customs. the finished set here is the complete set. the dbc building looks quite tall, especially when you count the antenna. comparing it to a screenshot from the episode, the general look of the building is there, although there are some inaccuracies. aside from the fact that it is obviously way down-scaled, the screens that show jjj ranting about spider-man should have been hexagonal, not square, and should have wrapped around the building. however, considering how many stickers you would have had to apply if they would have made it accurate, i'm actually glad they kept the screen mercifully small. much like doctor doom himself, the doom jet didn't actually appear in the beetle mania episode. however, it did appear in a later episode titled "not a toy" in which spider-man plays around with captain america's shield, accidentally drops it in doctor doom's latvarian embassy and has to try to retrieve it. and yes, that episode was as godawful as it sounds. here's a screenshot of the jet from that episode. like with the dbc, they managed to capture the general shape of the vehicle, although it doesn't look quite as good as in the show. the color scheme is too dark and it looks kind of blockier. let's take a closer look at the jet. there is no real way to reel the claw in unfortunately. however, there is a stud on the back of the jet that you can stick it onto. needless to say, this is not the ideal way of storing it. i would have much preferred it if they would have attached it onto winch instead. the engines on the wings can be turned, even though they don't turn in the show, and there is a flick-fire missile on each side. even if it's not much to look at, at least it's a very swooshable vehicle. on top of each wing there is a tile with the emblem of latvaria. there was no such emplems on the jet in the cartoon, but they are useful pieces that make it clear whose jet it is, so i'm glad they included them. there is nothing inside the cockpit except for a seat and unless you want to ruin dr. doom's nice dark green cape, i wouldn't put him inside of it. they could have at least printed a control panel onto that empty 2x2 tile. play features since this is a playset, let's look at all the play features it has to offer. like all playsets, the building is open in the back so you can play inside. on the ground floor, there is a potted plant and... nothing else. seriously? is this all they could come up with for this floor? they could have included a security desk, a lounge, a second plant, or anything else! as it is, it's just a boring empty lobby. the first floor is a bit more interesting. there is a safe, a swiveling chair, and a pin board with various pictures of spider-man. there is one tile that reads: "the true identity of spider-man" which is supposedly what the villains are after. i wonder how jameson got this information in the first place. speaking of jameson, the second floor is devoted to his office where he can sit and yell at his non-present employees, demanding "more pictures of spider-man!" it also has a swiveling chair as well as a desk with a lamp and a computer. there is a technic beam connecting his desk with the ceiling of the first floor which you can remove in order to take off the upper half of the building, but it's difficult to do, so i don't recommend it. as you may have noticed in the picture above, there are a few red pegs sticking out of the building. these are for triggering the play features. most of them are on the roof. there is one on what looks like an air conditioning unit. if you place spider-man holding is web-string on the jumper plate in front of it and push the peg, spidey goes bungee-jumping off the building. wee! there is also one that sticks out of the side of the building which when pulled triggers a trap door. the third red peg on the roof can be used to pop off the dbc sign. why is it called the dbc, you ask? it stands for daily bugle communications since in this version of spider-man, the daily bugle is not only a newspaper, but a news tv station as well, one that promotes its own highly biased views. so basically the fox news of the marvel universe. i guess if you're an old school spider-man fan, you could just leave off the "c" and have it just stand for daily bugle. the sign above the main entrance wont be so easily modified however. there is also a peg between the first and second floor which when pushed pops out one of the windows on the first floor. the safe is only attached to a couple of jumper plates and has some jumper plates on top of it as well, so you can easily attach the doom jet's claw to it and rip it out of the building as seen on the back of the box. there are also some snot bricks on the corners of the building that you can attach spiderwebs or spidey himself onto for some wall-crawling and webslinging action. this is not so much a play feature as it is just a feature, but as i mentioned earlier, there is a fire escape on the left side of the building. this was a neat idea as it helps it feel like a building in new york city, but it is executed very poorly. there is no hole big enough for the minifigs to climb down through, so they would have to climb down the ladders from the outside which makes no sense. no wonder spider-man always needs to rescue people from burning buildings. there is one more play feature in the form of the dumpster. you can open the lid, put a minifig inside, and make them jump by hitting a tab in the back. remember, this is before the introduction of super jumpers, but nevertheless it's a pretty strange place to launch minifigs out of. i guess even super heroes like to do some dumpster diving. you don't think this was funny? no? well, me neither, but that's the type of humor that this show loves to use. sigh. anyway, let's get on to the ratings. ratings design: 2/5 - the set looks ok. despite many inaccuracies, the dbc building and the jet somewhat resemble their on-screen counterparts and don't look too bad, but they definitely could be better. build: 1/5 - a mostly unchallenging and repetitive build with an attrocious amount of stickers. minifigs: 4/5 - definitely the strongest point of the set. some of the figs could be better, but four out of five of them are exclusive to this set. doctor doom is easily the best and probably the most desirable one - unless the fant4stic movie portraits him so badly that nobody will be interested in him, but that's impossible. playability: 4/5 - as you would expect from a playset, the playability is quite high, although i still feel like there could have been more. parts: 3/5 - not many rare parts. if you're looking for parts for building your own skyscraper with tan walls and lots of doors and windows though, this set is for you. price: 3/5 - at 476 parts for $50, this set is a bit pricey, but it is somewhat justified by all the large window and wall pieces. overall: 3/5 - this set is mediocre at best. playsets are always a good choice for spider-man sets since they give spidey something to swing from, but unfortunately they are rarely pulled off well. the jet is blocky, the building is bare-bones, and the price feels too high. the only reason to get this set are the four exclusive minifigs. this set was discontinued early this year, but if you still see it on clearance somewhere, go ahead and get one for the minifigs and parts, or buy multiples and use the parts to build a better dbc building. i hope you enjoyed this review. it is part of the reviewers academy's 7th anniversary. we're not doing a big celebration this year due to other commitments, but look out for more reviews with the 7th anniversary banner soon. now, if you'll excuse me, i am off to see fant4stic. i hope it's as fantastic as it promises to be! (2 hours later) i was wrong! i was horribly, horribly wrong!

1 this is my favourite set! should be making more spidey sets like this imo. *cough* oscorp tower *cough*

1 yeah. i'm really hoping the concept art/doom minifig joke is just that! i picked this set up on whim, mostly because a needed a building to add to a moc, as a parts pack it's not a bad set at all.

0 aegis2000, on 13 september 2015 - 02:32 am, said: this set is from 2013, doctor doom is completely based off the comic version/ tv show version, not the movie in any way. anyways, nice review. i personally own this set, and it's a nice set, but could have been better. he's just joking about doom.

0 i'm glad you were joking about doom. i'm not that big of a fanboy, but i had the need to correct you for some reason. with that said, i bought this set for the minifigures a few years ago. looking back, i don't really care about the figures today like i did in 2013. the building is decent for the size of the set though. thanks for the review.

0 personally, i thought your review was spot on and i very much enjoyed your tone. i'm not usually much of a mini-fig person, but i will admit i bought this set mostly for dr. doom (and considered nova a bonus). growing up, i was a big fan of the fantastic four and an even bigger fan of dr doom. i hope that someday the film rights will revert to marvel and we'll finally get a ff film that respects the original source material and features a dr doom worthy of the name. as for the set itself, i don't have much use for playsets (not that there's anything wrong with them, i think the marvel lego line could use more of them in fact) and i didn't even realize it was linked to a specific show as i've fallen a bit out of touch with the franchise of late. i bought it; i built it; it sat a shelf for a while; i scrapped it for parts. i think most of it wound up as a greenhouse for my winter village set-up. it's not a _bad_ set, but i think you summed things up nicely when you called it mediocre. thanks for the entertaining review.

1 thanks for the review.i'm not a big fan of spider man sets, but this set really impressed me. this must because of the design of this set and the minifigures that included in this set.

-1 i think i'm the only person in the world who likes fant4stic... was it the best superhero movie? not even close, but i didn't think it deserved the hate it got. it was just incredibly and clumsily mishandled. anyways, great review. i might pick this one up if only for the beetle fig.

1 another great review oky. i love this set.

1 good idea to make this review while you build the set. i'll be monitoring your progress and feedback. the box so huge! impressive!

1 many tks dunamis for doing that, its really great and i can't wait monitoring your progress on the beast 8-? like it was mentionned in another thread, the box looks less gigantic than i thought - remember the isd box !! that was a huge box !! is the instruction book in the pizza box ? how big is it ? i'm sure its really big and i hope for our sake that the colours are clearly marked x-d if you know what i mean :-d !! tks againand i'm so looking forward to your next post !! ras 74, on sep 27 2007, 08:51 am, said: you always seems to pull it of nicely, in comparission with the exasperating *yoda* x-d :-p what what what >:-( have you stopped your medication once again x-d *yoda*

0 wow that box is big but i somehow thought it would be even bigger, still it looks like for once lego are actully using all the space inside and not just a fraction like with other sets. cant wait to see more dunamis.....you lucky megablok ;-)

-1 my gawd that manuel is huge!!!!! that's enough to put a sane man off of buying this set.......thank gawd none of us are sane thats all i can say x-d just how many technic pins does this monster need??? 8-? judging by that one pic theres gotta be a lot in this set.

1 wow i never thought i'd be impressed by a box but i certainly am now. any chance of seeing all 5000 bricks in a big pile? vader, on sep 28 2007, 10:14 am, said: my gawd that manuel is huge!!!!! that's enough to put a sane man off of buying this set.......thank gawd none of us are sane thats all i can say x-d too true, never had i imagined thinking about buying a ?350 lego set before....christmas is soo close yet soo far.

1 good review. *y* me, i can't build it before saturday. :'-(

1 great review so far! i am looking forward to additional posts! as for the number of pins - from the peeron inventory for the set, there are over 400 technic pins of various lengths! (insert the "my fingers hurt from building" emoticon) keep the pictures coming!

0 the minifigs: as you can see, the minifigs are really nice. they even throw in an extra fleshie head! no doubt these will fetch quite a bit on the bricklink and ebay markets. i?m keeping mine. continuing the build this photo shows how well this model is put together. notice that they use four of the three-hole beams per side to hold this together. i remember reading that you can hang this model from the ceiling. i don?t doubt it. these right angle technic pieces are used to reinforce the structure of the model. you can see them used here: i was shocked at how many light gray plates are in this set. i have two tubs full of these: the infrastructure is now complete: i got hung up for about an hour looking for one of these: turns out, lego gave me an extra left wedge and shorted me a right wedge. so frustrating! i had to stead one off my 6211 star destroyer. it is not a very common piece by the way?

1 hey nice review, im up to about the same point as you (page 70 to be exact) , tho i didnt have that missing piece thankfully! i think lego have done a much better job at packing the lego this time, i remember it taking me much longer to find pieces on the ucs isd build

0 so i see they even do mistakes on these |-/ that beast looks really sturdy !! that is great !! are these yellow parts new ? i am not a technic fan and never saw these before. another question for you: is the instruction book easy to follow, especially regarding the colours. does the black rally stands out comparing to the dark bley and so on ? i sure hope so ;-) can't wait to see moer hehe *yoda*

0 xwingyoda, on sep 30 2007, 11:57 am, said: are these yellow parts new ? i am not a technic fan and never saw these before. you don?t have the building crane 7905 either? same color, same shape there: piece no. 32555 (four of them included) i assume you?re not a town fan? :-p ;-)

1 thanks for the review, and tons of pics! i've been wanting to pick this one up since i saw it. i thought the 4956 creator house was nice, but this model town house is in a completely different league! i also like the alternate models that you can see in the catalogues.

0 thank you for the review sinner. at first i wanted this set for the 4 blue 1x1 slope tiles, but i can see there is much more into it than that. it sure is a great value compared to what you get in the building bonanzas (no cars and less detail). it was funny to see the little side story in your pictures. would it be hard to modify the cars to fit minifigs better?

1 a beautiful and humorous review with very fine pics. *y* a fantastic set, full of neat details and in a wonderful color scheme. great for every city builder for sure. i guess we waited for sets like that. we dreamed about them. i?m glad we got them now. :'-) edit: congrats! it seems you?ve got your bucket back.... :-p

0 i found the use of parts well done by the designers. i made a car and then tried to make a house from a different instruction book. i could not as several pieces were already used in the car. nice to see them using all the parts like that rather than having a lot of "extra" bits. moral of the story: one instruction book at a time. *sweet*

0 lasse d, on sep 28 2007, 08:03 am, said: it sure is a great value compared to what you get in the building bonanzas (no cars and less detail). i was all for the white house until i saw this set. i still wouldn't mind it though. :-d lasse d, on sep 28 2007, 08:03 am, said: would it be hard to modify the cars to fit minifigs better? the problem with the blue truck is a lack of headroom. however the truck is quite low and i can't see it being too hard to change and still have it looking good. asuka, on sep 28 2007, 08:30 am, said: great for every city builder for sure. i guess we waited for sets like that. we dreamed about them. i?m glad we got them now. :'-) i think lego were really listening with this years creator sets. *wub* with the exception of the ferris wheel. they are all sets that you could buy 10 of and not have too many hard to use parts. asuka, on sep 28 2007, 08:30 am, said: edit: congrats! it seems you?ve got your bucket back.... :-p well, in this reality anyway! x-d who knows what goes on in the "wacker and walrus" world but i do seem to be a tormented soul. :'-(

1 awesome review! luckily you have two cute little friends and one beautiful lady to help you out! :-p i likewise love *wub* this set and your review does it credit! i laughed outloud a lot as i read it. i especially love you trying to look through the windowless back :-d :-d :-d great job, now sort that out and start building for our competition! x-d

1 excellent review with great pics and cameo appearances by some of our eb favs *y* definitely a set that was on my 'to get' list already, and this only confirms that. might make me want two, just because i love tan so much and i'd like to see if something could be done to bulk up that car. great job as always! :-)

1 thank you very much for the review sinner. i definitly *wub* this set. this will make a great addition for us "townies". i thought the size was too small. i plan to make my house fit practically the whole baseplate. plus i will definitly add floors, that looked :-d . i can't believe tlc skimped on the floors.

1 thanks for this review sinner! i love this house, with the nicely made tiled corners, the colorscheme and the garage. the only thing i dislike about this set is the way the windows are attached in train windows (so they turn inwards a little) instead of the usual frames with shutter-attachment-ability. but that is something that can be fixed in the blink of an eye. i will certainly buy this house some day when i find it at reasonable price.

-1 i too have bought this set and the only thing i notice which is a bit odd, with the exception of there being no floors in the house is the lack of a steering wheel in the car!

1 thanks for the review sinner! i definitely want this set now. the mixed rough and smooth roof bricks would annoy me on a model like the mtt, but here it looks as is if the roof is quite old with some parts being worn and pitted and some parts being replaced with new roof tiles. i quite like the effect. i agree on which is the best vehicle, and if it doesn't fit minifigs, just mod the heck out of it! x-d

1 sinner. you have convinced me. i bought this set yesterday when it was on sale at international lego weekend in sk?rb?k.

1 sinner, thanks for this outstanding review! i am glad that i had read this review in advance, before making my purchase on this set earlier with my girlfriend. we built this set for a total of 3 hours, to complete this beauty, in about 2 hours ago. there are stars circling around my head at this very moment, when i post this reply. i must admit from the bottom of my heart, that this is an wonderful piece of house, that simply shows the beauty of it, with the european kind of houses, where there is a garage. furthermore, there is a lovely blue car. i am seeing stars right now, in the middle of the night, and i must drop a thanks to you personally as well. although it is empty from its interior unlike the 4996 beach house, but this set has the majestic look which simply place a "wow" factor in front of it upon completion. at the moment, we had plans for getting the second set next month, to build the other design as well. hopefully, i will be able to share with you guys, all of my different creators sets, with its alternate designs as well in the near future.

1 nice pictorial review, i always like this little set ! a little more text would have been nice but that is ok as it is . ps: you should have mentioned in the title that this topic is picture heavy - i was wondering why it was loading so slow on my mobile

0 thanks for comments. i know about text, i'm trying to write more, but haven't succes in this yet. i thought about joining reviewers academy, but i'm not sure because i have only maimum 4(may be 5) hours each time when i can make review or something that needs some hours.

0 writing a decent review will indeed take some time. but you don't need to do it in a single session. if "each time" is 4/5 hours, you can write a review in 2 x "each time"

1 i actually bought this set last monday as it was reduced to 14.99.....it actually not a bad little set considering the size and part count, has a decent array of functions. its a nice little set....the b model looks just as good so i might buy a second set, as you get the bucket left over and i need that bucket for another set. edited by richard dower, 19 october 2015 - 04:42 pm.

1 remember when i said in my review of 7090 to expect a review after i went to toysrus? well, somehow things didn?t work out, but fortunately i?m finally reviewing my latest purchases, starting with 7091 catapault defense, which happens to be one of the best sets in the castle line. the box and instructions: lego box art is at it?s highest point ever these days, with lots of special effects and great action poses. the castle theme is no exception, and 7091 isn?t either. i?ll let the box speak for itself: i love the back of the castle boxes as well, since they give another action scene and other neat info like a layout of all the accessories. the contents: only the bare essentials as usual: piece bags and instructions. i seriously wish they still put mini catalogs inside sets like they did when i was young, but i guess they are too expensive to make or something. ah well, can?t have everything. no picture of the instructions this time, but since that isn?t necessary i?ll just say that they are fine, and do not have a problem with distinguishing dark gray from black. the pieces: here?s your basic shot of every piece included, minus a few extra pieces like an extra viking horn and black skeleton leg. not too shabby for a 10 usd set. there?s a lot of nice pieces in 7091, as you can see (and this doesn?t include the accessories or minifig parts!). the brown plates, wheels, and spoked things are always useful, and the dark blue and gold slopes are really cool. however, there?s also a fair amount of technic in here, so be warry. as usual for the castle line, 7091 has a heaping helping of accessories. most of them are old pieces recolored, but the ball on chain (what?s the actual name, could someone tell me?) and the shields are brand new. i actually like the new skeleton weapon, since it?s fairly detailed and was really the only way tlc could make a part like that. and yes, the shields are printed (quite nicely too, if i do say so myself). plus, you get viking horns (always useful to have), a grey boulder, a basket, and 3 helmets. not a half bad deal, eh? oh, who am i kidding ? it?s awesome! minifigures: ah yes, one of the highlights of any castle set. you get 2 soldiers and 2 skellies this time, all with different weapons. the two soldiers are just regular crown troops with different faces ? nothing special, except that they are awesome anyway. the skeletons on the other hand are much more interesting: an archer and a black skellie! archers cool, of course, but i know many don?t like the printing on the black skeletons. well, let me say that i don?t mind it so much. the only real problem is that the eyes are dark red instead of just red, which makes the printing a bit less noticeable. and i?ve been through it before that the new skeleton molds in general don?t bother me at all ? go skeletons! the finished set: alright, there?s two builds in this set, and i?ll start with the smaller: the skeleton barricade. okay, so it?s nothing special, but it?s cool all the less. the shield on the front and the slanted spears are nice touches. here?s just how the skeletons can tower over their own barricade: with a little step. ah, the catapault. the lovely catapault. seriously, i love tlc?s design. very effective, and also very realistic, especially compared to kk. love the side details and the swiveling base, and you gotta love the clever use of that basket. playability: yes, i?ve made it a tradition now to write stories for any castle set i buy (and this isn?t the last one, you can be sure of that!). here?s one featuring everything in 7901: oh, and here?s a small ship i made out of all the pieces in this set plus a couple extra figures and weapons from my copy of 7901. not half bad, imo, considering what i had to work with. overall rating: presentation: 9/10 pieces: 8/10 minifigures: 9/10 finished model: 9/10 playability: 8/10 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ final score: 8.6/10 once again, i highly recommend the reviewed set. castle is possibly the best theme this year, and this set is one of many that prove it. as with all castle sets, it?s best if you buy several if you want to truly enjoy it, but this set alone is also impressive in both design and pieces and minifigures. get at least one if you have even a slight liking for castle. edited by kimt, 10 august 2008 - 01:31 pm.

1 very nice review! seems like i'll be getting my first castle set soon.. *wub* grevious, on oct 10 2007, 09:33 pm, said: most of them are old pieces recolored, but the ball on chain (whats the actual name, could someone tell me?) that would be a flail. ;-)

1 i just got this today. it is amazing like my other two castle sets: the joust and the crossbow. i am currently starting to save for 2008 but for christmas i think i want the skeleton carridge and the naboo n-1 fighter.

1 it's that time of year again when the days get shorter, the nights get colder, and children all around the world stare longingly into warmly lit toy shops and prepare their wishlist to send to santa. this is also the time when the lego group releases their latest winter village set which has been an annual tradition for the past seven years. these sets have been very popular, especially among afols, and are always highly anticipated. however, while some entries in this series have been more popular than others, none has been as controversial as this year's set, the winter toy shop, which is a re-release of the first winter village set, 10199 winter toy shop from 2009. it seems that many think that this set didn't need to be remade and would have preferred a new set instead, or that it is not different enough from the original and will be redundant in a completionist's collection. does it deserve all the hate? let's find out. disclaimer: i don't own the 2009 version, so i can't compare them visually, but i will do my best to let you know what is different in this version. if you do need a visual reference, you can refer to svelte's excellent review of the original. set number: 10249 name: winter toy shop theme: creator year of release: 2015 pieces: 898 minifigs: 8 price: 59.99 / $79.99 / 69.99 s@h description: quote welcome to the winter toy shop! the holiday season has arrived and the toymaker is busy finishing off his latest creations! outside, children ski and snowboard, and a freshly built snowman sparkles in the light that shines from the toyshop tower. help decorate the huge tree that stands at the center of the square, play with the curious kitten on the cozy wooden bench or join in with the carolers beneath the ornate streetlamp. this charming set also features a ladder, trees in various sizes, jack-in-the-box, a toy biplane, helicopter, rocket, train, race car, truck, robot, tugboat, teddy bear and a wrapped gift. have fun building this enchanting winter wonderland! includes a snowman and 8 minifigures with assorted accessories: a male caroler, female caroler, a woman, 2 men, 2 boys and a girl. s@h bricklink brickset the box the box art of this set is similar to that of the original, but there are some notable differences. the christmas tree is on the right side of the image this time while the park bench is on the left and of course it features this year's design for creator boxes with the dark blue stripe along the right side and the "expert" logo in the top right corner. there's also a small picture of the back of the toy shop and the background looks less cartoony than on the original. the back is also very similar, showing a different angle of the toy shop along with some close-ups, although this time there is no minifig lineup. instead, the minifig lineup is on the right side of the box. it also includes the accessories that each minifig comes with and some of the toys. on the left side of the box there is a thumbnail of the box art and the set name in six different languages. they also want to make sure that you know that there are batteries included by saying it in dozens of languages. the top of the box features the inventory and a 1:1 scale reference with the female caroler. on the bottom there is a picture that reminds you that there is a light brick included in this set, in case that wasn't clear from the front of the box, and it confirms that yes, it is a bad idea to put it in water, in case you were planning to go swimming with your winter toy shop. the contents inside the box there are two instruction booklets and two groups of bags, one for each instruction booklet. while two groups of bags is not as many as there usually are in other sets of this size, it's still better than the first version of this set where the bags weren't numbered at all, so this makes the build a bit easier. the large bag in group 1 and the two large bags in group 2 have a white stripe going down the middle of the bag and only have one group number printed on it along with some other number and some kind of scan code. i have no idea why they made this distinction for these bags or what that code is for, so if any of you know the purpose of this, please let me know in the comments below. here is a random instructions page. as you can see, the building steps can get quite challenging as they sometimes include many different pieces in one step, especially when it uses a lot of brown pieces which are very dark and hard to see in the instructions, living up to the set's status as an expert-level set. most of the time, though, the instructions are pretty clear and easy enough to follow. there are some parts in new colors in this set that weren't in the first version or any other set until now, such as that large, flat technic arch in dark green, the jester hat in orange and blue, one of those new 2z2 round jumper tiles in brown, a golden frog(!), and a snowboard in dark blue. there are also some rare friends parts that make their creator debut here such as the skis in azure and that new clear 1x1 round tile with a tiny tube coming out of it which is usually used as a stand for friends accessories and is a very useful piece, especially for snot techniques (and no, i'm not talking about the type of snot that many people usually have stuck in their nose around this time of year). there are some printed parts as well, such as the clock tile, the letter tile, and the register slope like in the first version of the set. we also get a new face print for the white cat which is more in line with other modern cat designs. but the best part is the shop sign which is printed this time around. it features a lovely wood pattern, the words "toy shop", and a toy soldier on both sides of the sign. which is ironic since the shop doesn't seem to sell any toy soldiers like this, but it looks so good on the sign that i won't sue them for false advertising. the minifigs let's start with the most unique figures in this set, the carolers. these two were also the highlight in the first version of the set, but in the original they both had the same head (this one -> ) which featured a very questionable facial expression that could easily be taken out of context. in this version, they have unique faces which look much better and help distinguish their gender. the male caroler uses lord vampyre's torso which looks quite snazzy on him. maybe this is lord vampyre before he became a vampire? the female caroler is easily the best minifig in the set, though, because in addition to her exclusive head, she also gets an exclusive torso and skirt print! a huge improvement over the generic unprinted one in the original. she also gets the queen hair in dark brown and aragorn's lined cape instead of two combined regular capes. this set truly is the return of the queen! the snowman is technically not a minifig, but as you can see here, he is exactly as tall as one and he is the first thing you build after the minifigs, so i included him here. he has mostly the same design as before, except this time he has robot claws for arms instead of levers. which is good since they allow him to hold accessories such as his broom. his carrot nose is included separately again. the carolers both have back printing while the snowman looks no different from the back than he does from the front. here you can see the black side of the female's cape. this lined cape is so much nicer than the solution they used in the original. next up we have what i assume is a married couple who are likely the parents of at least one of the kids, as well as the toymaker who i will call geppetto. the man in the pinstripe suit was not included in the first version of the set, so he's a bonus minifig! these guys are fairly generic, but they have some detailed torso prints, so they look pretty nice. geppetto seems to have gotten younger since the release of the original set since his gray hair has now turned dark tan and he doesn't seem to need glasses anymore. the men both have back printing, but the woman is the only one in this set who doesn't get a back print. why you gotta be so discriminating against women, lego?! last but not least, there are the kids. one of the boys wears dark blue pants, a green jacket, and a wool cap. he looks a bit like a lumberjack, so let's call him lumberjack boy, or jack for short. the little girl wears an outfit that wouldn't look out of place in the friends theme with a lavender scarf and pants. i'll call her lavender. the second boy is wearing an octan jacket and a sports helmet which makes it ironic that he is the one not doing any winter sports on the box art. i'll call him president business junior, or pbj for short. all of the kids have fairly detailed back printing which makes up for the fact that much like the adults, they are made out of mostly common parts. pbj's helmet and scarf cover up the back of his head nicely which is important as you will see in the next picture. what's also great about these figs is that half of them have a double-sided head. here you can see pbj doing his best macaulay culkin impression. i also removed his scarf so you can see the printing on his torso better. but he's not the only one who seems to be easily scared. the mother also has a very alarmed expression. maybe she got surprised by the jack-in-the-box or maybe she just realized how expensive toys are nowadays. you can see the female caroler's back printing here. her alternate expression is a non-singing face which is very nice to have and i wish the male caroler could have one too. she looks quite cute with those rosy cheeks. but the most adorable out of all of them has to be the little girl. she comes with a pouting sad face that will melt your heart. please, don't cry! i'll buy you any toy you want, just stop looking at me like that! the build the first half of the build is dedicated to the surroundings of the toy shop. it includes the christmas tree, the park bench, the snowman, the toys, the carolers, jack and lavender. the large bag contains two smaller bags with small pieces, a white box that contains the caroler's cape, and the jester hat in its own little bag. the first thing you build after the minifigs and the snowman is the toys. this version of the set has a lot more toys than the original which is good because i always felt that the first toy shop was a bit light on toys. also, the ones that were in the original have been updated. for example, instead of the two pairs of skis, you now get one pair of skis that use the new ski mold and a snowboard. the jack-in-the-box is mostly the same, except it now has an orange and blue color scheme instead of the red and blue from the original. this change was probably not necessary, but hey, at least we get a new jester hat out of it. and instead of the brick-built teddy bear you get the new teddy bear mold. i have mixed feelings about this change because i actually kinda liked the brick-built teddy design and using a specialized mold seems to be going against the spirit of creator sets, but on the other hand i can't deny that the molded teddy looks better than the blocky old one. meh. the new toys include a tugboat which has some rounded technic pieces as its hull, a biplane, a rocket, a helicopter, and a truck that cleverly uses roller skates for its wheels. these are all quite brilliant designs that feel like micro versions of lego city sets and make a great addition to the set. here is a back view of some of the more complex models. as you can see, the friends accessory stand has been cleverly used to hold the biplane's fin in place and to provide a stand for the helicopter. the jack-in-the-box has a hinged lid. the only thing that bugs me a bit is the t-piece on top of the helicopter that holds the rotor in place, but i can't think of any better way they could have done it. next is the ladder that is used to decorate the tree which is exactly the same as the first version. the supports are on a click-hinge, so they can be adjusted or folded away. then, you build the tree itself. you begins, of course, with the stand which is mostly the same design as before, but this time the plates at the bottom are brown instead of white and have golden studs as feet. next, you build the first layer of branches. the main difference in this version of the tree is that this one actually has a brown stem rather than just a technic axle on which you stack the layers of branches one by one. you wont be able to see the stem in the final result, but i like this change as it makes the tree more realistic. then you add the second layer of branches. this one doesn't have lights/candles and attaches to the lower layer at an angle using the four trans-yellow studs close to the stem. the third layer is added. this one has lights again. each layer is similar in that they are all made out of green plates that are built around a 4x4 ring plate, but they get smaller each time and are constructed differently enough for the build not to feel repetitive. with the addition of the fourth layer, we get close to finishing the tree. lastly, you add one more layer and the tip of the tree. now it's time to decorate the tree! however, it's not as fun as it sounds since that requires you to add lights to the two chains/ropes first which can get a bit repetitive. the clips holding the lights to the chain were white, but this time they're pearl gold which looks much nicer in my opinion. the next part of the build is the park bench with the streetlamp and the little tree. this is a fairly quick build with not much to it. the fishbowl helmet parts are a useful piece that you don't see too often, so it's nice to get them again in this remake. the design is pretty much the same as in the original set except for the wreaths on the streetlamp which use a green life preserver instead of a round 2x2 plate. this is another instance where they use a specialized piece instead of a brick-built solution, but i'm okay with that because unlike with the teddy bear, this part was not originally intended to be a wreath, so it's still nice part usage. the second half of the build is dedicated to the toy shop itself and includes the couple, geppetto, and pbj. please note that there is a fourth 6x10 plate burried under the parts. you begin by tiling the floor, setting up the walls, and adding the interior items such as the fireplace, the cash register, and the toy displays. next, you add the walls, windows, and the door and the ground floor of the shop is finished. so far, the build is the same as the old toy shop, except this time they decided to have the white stripes on the marquees be the longer ones instead of the dark red ones for some reason. i don't know why they did this and kinda would have preverred to get dark red 1x1 plates instead of white, but it doesn't detract from the look of the shop, so i don't really care. now we begin with the upper floor. this is where things start to look a little different. can you tell the difference? the difference is that this time they attach the roof using clip-hinges instead of bulky technic constructions which gives you more space on this floor and allows it to look more like an actual attic. they even tile the floor next to the frog clock. aftter adding the roof, the build is finished. the main roof feels a bit loose since it's only attached to the building by one side. i'm not sure if this was an issue in the old toy shop, but it's not a big deal. i just wouldn't pick the set up by the roof. what i do like is that they used double cheese slopes on the awning on the outer wall of the tower instead of singles which makes it a bit easier to build. i like how the supports under the tower roof now match those of the main roof. the wreaths have also been updated like the ones on the streetlamp. and those technic arches under the roof look a lot more like garlands now. on the original, they were dark gray, so i didn't even know they were supposed to be garlands and assumed they were part of the architecture. the shop sign looks a lot better now that it is printed. the old one just looked like a white flag. i also like how the small plates under the marquee give it a wavy look and they included two trees in different sizes on the right side of the shop. the back is nice and open and allows you to see the rest of the toys, the robot, train, and race car, all of which have just as much of a simple and clever design as the other toys. the clock looks much nicer with the new golden frog. because golden frogs make everything better. spare parts there are quite a few small parts left over, including a roller skate and one of those friends accessory stands which will come in handy. the complete set here you can see the full set together. it looks quite nice and festive with all the little details and there are many scenes that you can play out with it: you can have the minifigs decorate the tree, have the kids play in the snow, have the carolers sing by the bench, have the toymaker build some toys in his workshop, or have the parents buy presents for their kids. it's a festive, toy-filled winter wonderland! the fireplace looks cozy and i like the brick pattern going up the chimney. the entrance of the shop looks a bit empty aside from the cash register. i feel like they could have displayed some more toys here, but oh well. being a set targeted at teens and adults, there aren't really any play features aside from the light brick which is attached to a hinge, so you can either activate it by pressing the button with your finger or tilting the brick upward so that the button is pressed against the roof. however, since the roof is not connected in the middle and only attached on the sides, it tends to split open a bit when you do that, so i'm not sure if attaching the roof this way here was such a good idea. nevertheless, it looks quite nice when the light is lit. ratings design: 5/5 - this set is as gorgeous as it was back in 2009! the small updates that they made are mostly good ones, although the absence of a brick-built teddy is a bit disappointing and the new way the roof is attached, while not as bulky as before, makes the roof slightly unstable, but those are just nitpicks. build: 5/5 - there are some interesting building techniques here, such as those on the tree, the roof, and the toys. the fact that the parts are only split into two groups and the part callouts can get fairly complex makes it a challenging, enjoyable build. minifigs: 5/5 - they did a great job updating the figs in this set. while only 3 of the torsos in the original had any printing, all of the torsos have printing front and back in this set, even the skirt and cape of the female caroler. you get two exclusive heads and half of the heads are double-sided, plus you get 8 instead of 7 minifigs. you really can't ask for more in a creator set. playability: 4/5 - this set is more meant to be displayed than to be played with, but there are plenty of things to play with if you want. all the different minifigs, accessories, and set pieces make for endless possibilities for play. it's especially fun to swoosh the micro vehicles around. parts: 3/5 - there are lots of good parts here. most of them are fairly common, but there are some rare parts and some even in exclusive colors. price: 4/5 - this set costs $20 more than the original, but considering that this set has nearly 900 pieces, including some rare and exclusive ones, as well as more minifigs with much better printing, i think $80 is still a fair price. overall: 5/5 - so what's my opinion of this set? for a remake, i think it's great. they managed to make a good set even better. are the changes minor? yes. are they an improvement? mostly, yes. were they necessary? perhaps not, but it's good that they made them instead of just re-releasing the exact same set. so if you didn't get the first winter toy shop, i can highly recommend getting this one. if you do already have the old version, this one might still be worth picking up for the hugely improved minifigs and rare parts alone. as for the controversy over re-releasing the winter toy shop, i can see where the haters are coming from, but i find their complaints to be quite petty. i can understand if you're disappointed because you already have the first winter toy shop and were looking forward to a new set this year, but there's always next year. if you're a completist and feel like tlg is forcing you to buy a set you don't need, you're wrong. nobody is forcing you to buy anything but yourself. if you decide to buy every set in a theme no matter what it is, that's your problem, not lego's. so put down your torches and pitchforks and just be glad that they improved the set design and gave us another chance to buy this classic set. there are far worse things that can happen in this world than lego re-releasing one of their most popular sets. sorry for that little rant. so what is your opinion on re-releases like this? please cast your vote in the poll above. i hope you enjoyed this special eurobricks reviewers academy review and would like to thank the lego group for the opportunity to review this set. happy holidays everyone!

1 thanks for a great review first of all. i do like the upgrades and changes made from the original 2009 set, more colours and parts are offcourse available today than back in 2009. it does look like a great set and i would really realy have loved to get it myself if i had the funds. however their are so many other sets thats first priority for me this december and next year, so sadly i might have to pass on this if its not that i can get it redicioulusly cheap at some point. and yeah, we should appreciate that lego does keep sets coming, even if its just upgrades from earlier releases. town is known for a new police and fire station every year, cant see why a new toyshop is so upsetting. once again thanks for a great review. and happy holidays to you as well.

1 nice to see they finally updated that generic screaming face from the 2007 castle line. awesome review, oky. i have the old set so i won't be picking this up.

0 great review! i just built the original, and this one has clear advantages over the original (though i wish lego would stop putting torsos with defined breasts and curves on children). i really like pretty much every change. i won't be getting it, and i'd be lying if i said i'm not a little disappointed. for the first four years, my mother-in-law got me the new winter village set for christmas; after the last two, which didn't really fit thematically in my display, i had hoped for a new one--particularly since my daughter is getting to be around the age where she can play with them. i mention her specifically because i've seen lots of people dismiss those who are a bit disappointed as rabid adults who don't care about kids getting cool sets, and i don't think that's fair. i may have to see how much some of the parts go for on bricklink. the rerelease is better than the original, but not good enough that i'd want to spend $80 to get a set that's nearly identical to one i have. edited by tea weevil, 29 november 2015 - 04:31 pm.

0 hobbythom, on 29 november 2015 - 04:07 pm, said: great review. you almost make me want to buy one. i don't know what it is with these sets. on the one hand they are so nicely designed and cute on the other side i never seriously consider buying one. i can't explain what it is that holds me back. a lack of money, maybe? that's the thing that usually holds me back. anyway, i have the older version, so i am not interested in this set.

1 regarding the reason for the different designs on the inner bags, i think that the white stripe is the new version, with the non-stripe version being old. i suspect the reason some sets have both versions is simply that they're still using up some of their supply of older bags. good review. i didn't realise there were quite as many changes as you highlighted (tree, roof etc).

1 i missed out on the first one, but i love the improvements made in this version, like the tree having an actual brown trunk so it looks less like an artificial one, and the carolers as well. i may pick this up, but i'm sorry to those of you who already have one.

1 i bought it and i'm very happy with it.

0 cheers for putting up the review. some nice improvements, but not enough for me to pick it up. the original set is good enough for me. pity the poll has no option "yes, but only in addition to new sets, not in stead of new sets". edited by withacee, 01 december 2015 - 09:38 am.

1 thanks for a nice review. i am building it as we speak, and i like it so far. since i didn't have the old one, i can't complain.

0 thanks oky for this fine review. i agreed with your sentiments on the unnecessary rants. i also owned the 2009 version and even though there are minor improvements. there must be a logical reason for its release again but is not entirely the same. i felt is an excellent opportunity for others to acquire this design especially after six years ago. as for myself, i will probably buy this if my spare funds allow me to own this set.

0 thanks for the kind comments everyone! i like hearing your opinions on this set. withacee, on 01 december 2015 - 09:37 am, said: pity the poll has no option "yes, but only in addition to new sets, not in stead of new sets". i don't think that would be a realistic option as that would mean that they would have to spend twice the resources on this theme which i don't think they are ready to do, but if more people would like this option, i can add it to the poll. joebot, on 01 december 2015 - 08:33 pm, said: after mocking people for holding a particular opinion, you then turn around and ask people to express their opinion?? no thanks. i guess i'll keep my opinions to myself. i certainly don't want to be labeled a "hater." i'm not mocking anyone. i just think that some people need to calm down a bit and that tlg is getting more hate than they deserve for this set, but that's just my opinion and you're welcome to disagree with it. everyone is entitled to their own opinion, including you and me. and yes, i would love to hear your thoughts on this matter because i would like to have a friendly discussion on this subject.

1 i didn't own the original toy shop so i bought it this time around. i just finished building it saturday and i love it! however, i wish they had both re-released this one and came out with a new addition to the village. :)

-1 while i can see kids enjoying this, i'm not sure i would buy. the flex axles are nice, and it is a decent number of white panels but i think i would get better return out of a larger parts set. fantastic review though, and your pictures show off this tiny model better than the box art does.

1 very nice little set, and a lot of those new white small panels. it's a need!

1 thanks for the nice review! the landing mechanism looks quite cute. aren't the yellow axles 5l, not 4l? (very strange that they would release such a part).

1 for 10 euros very usefull parts. i like it as well as other 2016 sets. i like the gear retracting mechanism a lot. very good set for good price. thanx for good review. :) max

1 hi there, nice model, great review! i almost reverse engineered this model, but used wrong parts for landing wheels, didn't know how to fix the nose proper, and so on. so i was very interested in this model and i like playing with it. i love the reviews, but i think i have to mention, that the yellow axle must be a 5l! the picture shows a 5l, and a 5l would fit the size of the model. the cart has also a 5l in yellow. what sitze is the yellow axle in this seit. really 4l as written in the text? greetings, robert

1 very nice review for a nice little set! i especially like the smoothness of operation for the retractable landing gear. i don't like the lack of symmetry for the propeller of the b model though, but understand the alternative would be to add one extra small panel to the set, or skip two of them in the b model.

1 good review, as always jim when i first saw this set i thought that it would make a great parts pack for me, as that i have about 20 white pieces in my technic collection (all from 42043) and this set has some really useful ones, all for a cheap price. those 7l flex axles will be extremely useful in my current build i'm doing

1 nice review, even with the missing demonstration video of the a-model! looks like this is an excellent panel pack for the price, and those soft axles will go down a treat. will this set be the dark horse of 1h 2016...?

1 i just built the a model, and i rather like it. it is much bigger than it looks from the box - about 30 studs long. there is only one function - the landing gear - but it works very nicely. apart from that, it's a very solid build, and achieves an elegant shape with an absolute minimum of parts. i don't usually get excited about small sets, but this one appeals to me. i like the feeling that every single piece has a purpose.

1 boulderer, on 27 december 2015 - 05:44 pm, said: my favourite of the 2016 sets i've built so far. i'd go so far as to say this is the best "budget" set in years. i would have loved this when i was a kid ... great "swoosh ability" ?????? good to hear that, im gonna check the toy shops in my lunch break tomorrow, see if they got their shipment in yet, if they have, ill definitely buy one of these little sets

0 i got this little set for xmas and i noticed all the gaps and decided to fix them, so here it is. img_5344 by jj2sam, on flickr first i added some beams to the wings and top to make it less hollow, second i put some navigation lights on it, i made the nose a bit wider and added a control panel, and lastly i changed out the landing gear wheels to more appropriate ones. img_5349 by jj2sam, on flickr more pictures are here

1 thats a cool little mod, two small nigles though, 1, your navigation lights are flipped on the main wings, 2, the panels on the tail i *think* were supposed to be the intakes for the jet engine, by using them to close up the tail you've turned it into a glider cant wait untill i find one of these on shelves!

1 so this set showed up in stores yesterday, and i immediately picked two up. all in all it is a nice set, but it is slightly different from what i was expecting, the plane feels a bit "flat", pointy nose, wide bottom etc.. and while the panels work very well as wings, it feels a bit simplistic to just have single-part wings. the stickers really work for it though. its a cracking set though, nice parts pack, and a nice model as well

1 got this at the weekend, mainly for the parts, but built it first. agreed with other comments - awesome swooshability.

1 review - 42046 - getaway racer introduction starting with the 42010 - off-road racer and 42011 - race car in 2013, tlg released two sets in the first half of each year, using a pullback motor. the pullback motor allows the model to be pulled back, followed by forward motion. usually there's no apparent relation between the two set, other than the ability to combine them into an alternate build. this year there seems to some sort of cops and robbers scene going on. a getaway racer and a police interceptor. that can't be a coincidence. makes you wonder who will be victorious, the good guys or the bad guys. let's find out! note: all images can be clicked for hi-res versions. set information number: 42046 title: getaway racer theme: technic released: 2016 part count: 170 box weight: 302 gr box dimensions: 26,0 cm x 13,8 cm x 5,9 cm set price (msrp):  19,99 price per part:  0,118 links: brickset, bricklink the box the box has the same dimensions as previous year's pullback motor sets. in the lower right corner there's a visual explanation of the pullback mechanism. the dark model with it's decals sure looks like a cool hot rod. content of the box the box contains: 1 instructions booklet 1 sticker sheet 2 technic liftarms 1 pullback motor 3 bags instruction booklet just a single booklet. unfortunately no booklet for the alternate model. sticker sheet the sticker sheet contains a lot of cool stickers with flames and skulls etc. pullback motor and liftarms the pullback motor and two liftarms are found unbagged. bags a total of three bags containing the majority of the parts. highlighted parts this section describes the new and/or otherwise interesting parts. actually, this set is the only set of 1h 2016 which doesn't use any new parts, not even parts in a new color. tires the getaway racer uses four low profile tires (tire 37 x 22 zr). rims the rims are wheel 30.4mm d. x 20mm in pearl gold, found in 12 other sets. panels this set contains three #3 panelsand three #4 panels in black. part list this set contains 171 parts, all listed below. the build this being a small model, i won't show any building steps. let's skip right to the finished model. below you can see the end result. in my opinion the model looks great. it's got that hot rod vibe going on and the stickers add darkness to the vibe. slight problem with this set is that it really needs the stickers to finish the look. otherwise it's quite dull, with black and dark grey liftarms and panels. the rear view shows the pullback motor connected directly to the rear axle. in this image you can also clearly see the exhaust pipes on the side, which are very well executed. the 3x3 technic discs with stickers, used in the rim, result in only seeing a part of the rim. this works very well with the golden rims. the bottom view shows the chassis of the car. nothing really noteworthy, as you would expect from a pullback set. video the following video gives you an overview of the finished model. parts left these six parts are left after building the model. seems about right. features and functions this being a pullback motor set, it only has a single feature. the video below demonstrates the acceleration of the vehicle. my girlfriend was kind enough to catch the model before it fell to the ground. or did it hit something before it fell to the ground?! video this video shows the pullback functionality. b-model the alternate model is a combined build with the police interceptor, which you can see on the back of the box. unfortunately the instructions for the combined b-model are not included, so i didn't get a chance to build it. this would make for a fun challenge, building the b-model without the instructions. summary pullback sets are not the most technically advanced models, so you can't expect any other functionality than hitting the walls in your house. however, i think they are very appealing to kids. the fact that this year's pullback sets form a duo adds to the fun. in my opinion tlg hit the nail on the head with the getaway racer and police interceptor. the getaway racer looks very badass, which is something you don't see every day in a technic set. score how do i grade the bad guy in this year's duo. 8 design it looks so cool, but it does need the stickers. 7 building experience nothing out of the ordinary. 7 features limited to the pullback-and-drive functionality. 7 playability combined with the police interceptor, kids will love it. it does need it's nemesys though. 7 parts collection of common parts. gold rims could be interesting. 8 value for money pullback sets always deliver a certain value. 7,3 hit it! more image can be found on my flickr page. thank you for reading. i hope you enjoyed it.

1 i almost purchased this today because i like the wheel / disc combo so much.

0 one hero will now have just enough of that pullback motor to create one ultimate machine, thanks to this.

0 theitalianbrick, on 01 december 2015 - 09:32 am, said: jim great reviews but can i suggest you one thing? take some pics before you apply the stickers....and some with the stickers on! it helps to have a comparison! you are right. i came to the same conclusion when writing the review. i tell you it doesn't look that good without stickers, but i don't have a picture to prove it. to be honest; i compared it to the model posted in the 2016 topic a few days ago. i applied the stickers before building the model, so i wasn't able to make a proper comparison. i will keep it in mind for future reviews. thanks for the suggestion.

0 cool! glad you like 'em. and thanks for the kind words.

-1 not sure what people like about this set, i think it's the worst of all 1h2016 sets. odd shape, bland colors, no new parts, and the windscreen isn't even closed. but the reviews are great, indeed. :)

0 first thing i thought: hot wheels?? whut. the set looks like the hot wheels 'bone shaker'.

1 what a nice, tight an clean design! usually not too keen on the pull-back models, but this one is great.

0 the instructions for the extreme police interceptor combo model is now online....will someone do a review of this b model? https://wwwsecure.us...tselector=true#

0 thanks again for the review. i am not sold on this one yet, but i confess it took about 2 years for me to finally appreciate 9396. maybe i need to see this in person.

1 thanks for the review. i wonder if the design inspiration came from the russian ka-32 helicopter.

1 lego 42049 mine loader thanks to lego and eurobricks for making this review possible! this was supposed to be a preview-review, before the dec 1 release date for the set, but it got stuck in customs or something and didn't arrive in time. well, i'd rather do a good, late review than a rushed review, so here it is. name: mine loader set number: 42049 pieces: 476 (i think) price: $39.99 (i think) minifigs: 0 theme: technic year of release: 2016 links: bricklink brickset the box another standard technic box, not that there's anything wrong with that. it is a littler weird that the mine loader is shown outside the mine, but whatever. the back of the box again, very standard. it's oddly technical, showing the exact angle of the machine when turning, but that's the sort of nerdy detail that technic people like. the alternate mine cutting machine model looks interesting and unusual as well. the 1:1 part the 1:1 part on the top of the box is especially helpful with this set. these mining machines are very oddly proportioned, since they need to fit in mine tunnels, so it's hard to judge the model size based on the wheels or seat like you can an ordinary set. the contents you get manuals for both models (a single book for the b and two books for the main), a medium size sticker sheet, 4 bags, and 4 loose tires. the special parts this set has 4 of the new mudguard panels in yellow, two cylinder halves in red (a new color), some of the new color red and yellow axles, a couple of the new-ish technic spacers, some of the axle-pin combination pieces, and a couple swords! i'm pretty sure that's "an antenna" and a spare. the start of the b-model since i like the main model better, i'm building the alternate first, so that's how i'll write the review. there's "power" for something (probably the engine) being taken off the one axle here. overall, a pretty standard technic frame beginning with some structural beams, a frame, and using liftarms to support axles out to the sides. more of the frame the far end of the model has some obvious steering mechanism being formed, as well as a pivoting arm right in the center that's probably the connection from the hand of god knob. the steering yup. called it. oddly, there is a different turning radius between right and left right now. i wonder if that'll get fixed... more mechanisms that's looking more technic now. sad to see a u-joint being used just as a fixed straight connection like that, but it is the alternate model... the engine block because all engines should be enclosed in a red cylindrical housing, am i right? the chassis it's definitely coming together now. and yes, the b-model instructions tell you to put the stickers on. it doesn't matter whether you build the main or alternate first, you'll get the stickers on (almost - there were a couple leftover that didn't get used in the b-model). almost done with the rest of the body done and the wheels on, you really get the scale of this machine. that blue seat is tiny compared to the rest of it! and yes, the uneven steering lock got fixed. after putting the wheels on, you add a couple of "pin with ball" pieces to the underside to restrict the steering. they didn't do that at first so that you could turn the axles sharper while putting the wheels on, which made it easier to do. the grinder keeping in mind the scale of the machine, this thing looks terrifying! the tan gear at the back drives the spinning blade up front. the red bushes near the turntable let you adjust the angle. all done the arm quickly attaches to the body and it's done. sadly, that tan gear doesn't connect to anything - it's just a knob so you can spin the blade by hand. raise your hand, if you're sure... (i think i'm dating myself with that title...) this thing has massive reach. i'm imagining this inside a mine, grinding away the rock overhead. pretty viciously effective machine! the crank on this side of the model is used to raise and lower the arm. works well, and the grey spacer makes it nice to use since it spins freely. the leftovers not much left for a b-model. nice usage! starting the main model the main model starts similarly to the alternate, with a frame, some axles, and a drive connection from one axle to something later. getting complicated already we're only a few pieces in and we already have three separate gear trains going on. there's the axle driving the tan beveled gears inside the frame at the bottom. there's more tan gears in the middle, and there's also a black gear sticking up as a knob that turns the grey connector in the center. the body is done i skipped ahead quite a bit, but it was a bunch of standard technic building. you've got a fake engine with fan at the back, driven by one of the rear wheels, a knob sticking up for steering, and an axle coming forward to open and close the claw. the claw! i like that they used a link system to open and close the claw instead of just gearing it. the axle comes forward from the chassis (it's the red axle) with a couple u-joints for flexibility and drives a worm gear. that rotates a gear below with a 2 stud liftarm on each side. those arms have pin with towball in them and then a link going from that short liftarm to the claw. it's a small rotation of the liftarm, but makes the claw open widely and works very well. raising the claw a few black liftarms join the claw to the body of the loader and allow it to move up and down. it's a simple mechanism there - one yellow beam goes back and connects to a lever that lets you raise and lower the claw. when raised (as shown), the lever locks in place by going just slightly past the centerline. and it's done add some wheels, a cab, and some wheel arches and we're done. it's a great looking machine, pretty unique, and looks like the real thing. the main difference from reality is these usually have a scoop for moving loose rock. since we've had so many scooping vehicles in the past (tracked loaders, the volvo l350f, excavators, etc) the claw here is a fun change and adds to the playability for kids. like the real thing, the body stays very low so the cab only has to stick up a little bit for the driver to see all around, because mines are cramped and busy areas. from the rear this angle is great. i love the use of the new mudguard panels to make a nice curve to the back of the loader. the antenna is a little weird, but perhaps they had a big pile of flat silver fencing swords to use up. the black gear just to the left of the antenna is the claw control. rotating that gear opens and closes it. the back end is a little lighter than a real machine would be, but lego wanted to leave the engine exposed so you can see the cylinders moving. the conclusion so, what's my conclusion on this model? i like it a lot. it's simpler than a big set would be, but it's got lots of design and playability crammed in a mid-sized set. it's a unique vehicle. however, it does have a few flaws. the steering on the main model needs some drag added. as is, you basically have to drive by holding the steering knob since it'll bend if you push it from behind. i don't like the use of pin with pin hole as mounting points for the orange and red trans plates for lights, since they can turn slightly and be at weird angles. the antenna is unnecessary and in the way. but none of these flaws are dealbreakers or even big deals. they're minor. the ratings value: 10/10 - less than 10 cents a piece, lots of useful liftarms and such, nothing too weird or single-use. design: 9/10 - looks very realistic for the size of the set, good functionality, not too dependent on stickers minifigs: n/a - n/a playability: 9/10 - controls aren't perfect (loose steering, small knob for claw control) but very functional and cleverly done. parts: 9/10 - nice selection, although heavy on the standard yellow and black. almost zero studded parts. overall: 9.5/10 - it's a great intro to technic set - a unique vehicle, good functionality, nice part selection, and decently priced. i like it a lot and plan to keep it around as a finished set.

1 great review with high quality pictures, well done!! i'm glad you took the time to do it properly. cool that you have built both models. i agree with the mudguards. they sure look good on this model.

-1 i was waiting especially for review of this set. let me add few things about this... thing. it all will be complainging of person who works with these type of machines, so if you just want a unusual machine in your collection, ignore my complaining :) i see underground loaders almost every day, and believe me, this model would now work in the underground mine. first of all, its cab should stick out more from the frame. each loader has cab placed out of the chassis, to provide better view for the driver. in this class of machine it would help a bit, but in low loader ones it is extremely important: this is the view from the cab of a low profile loader (looking at front - and yes, front of the machine is where engine is placed, because at least at kghm all machines drive engine forward): another thing about that cab is that seat and steering wheel/joysticks are placed perpendicularly to the machine chassis, to provide same view for driving forward and backwards. so another weak spot of the set. the model lacks of trans clear lights on the engine part, because all machines that work underground have same lamps on front and back. another thing that comes to my mind is that warning light and antena would not live too long in the mine, becuase it could be torn apart by ramming into tunnels roofs. it does resemble shape of underground machine, but not a loader. only machine that comes to my mind is something that are used for moving/placing hydraulic support jacks in tunnels. sorry for poor quality, i didn't find better picture of it: it does have claw, four wheels and articulated chassis, but have much greater range of movement of the arm. anyway, i'd give it at least 3/5 for overall look. model itself, as a set, looks unfinished (or cut down on pieces after visit of an accountant...) for me it looks like engine part was built differently, with knobs for steering/claw operating sticking out from back. claw needs almost seven full turns of the worm gear to close from opened position, and is rather annoing to use it in way it is built in this model. bracket that holds bevel gears responsible for steering is rather loose, being hold in place by single 3/4 pin. on the other hand, the steering works very well. it seems that lack of differential will be more common in lego sets, becuase it is another model that have fake engine driven by single wheel (like in old russian rc cars...). i am ok with that, but it is a pitty that this model has only r2 engine. thing that i do not like the most in this model is how the claw arm works. first of all, it barelly lifts the claw of the ground, the movement could be much better. and it has major design flaw - universal joints are not placed in line with articulation points, and this is main reason of 5l axle not being suported on both sides under the turntable. while rainsing the arm, it bends a little! i really would like to see this model built differently, with normal bucket and better range of movement. edited by m_longer, 05 december 2015 - 11:08 pm.

1 excellent review! worth waiting for. the set itself is very interesting. looks like it may have one interesting build techniques. thanks for the review, andy ad

0 great review, thank you. the set to me is kinda blah, interested more in the new panels than the rest of it.

-1 great review and great pictures ! many thanks for talking the time to review this set . i am a fan of lego technic construction stuff, but this set is not so appealing to me. but, then again i am sure some people will love it.

-1 great review! one thing reaaaaaally bothers me about this set, both models have the engine connected to one wheel, the other wheel on the "powered" axle is just left to rotate freely, and that really bothers me, as it did in 42022 (on 42022 even more tbh, since its main feature is being a frigging car). looking at the pics it isnt even a space issue (as it was in the hot rod, where they "needed" to route the steering through), so they just cheaped out and didnt bother fitting a diff in there (or even a live axle link) im not very interested in this set (not into construction stuff), but i think this is a worrying trend :(

0 definately a quirky set, i think i'd have prefered a bucket on the front with a complex lift and tip mechanism, but a grab is different. as for the b model, i may prefer it's functions to the a model, certainly something different we have not seen before.

0 great review indeed!

0 looks like its using the z60 turntable that's on the mercedes and the crawler crane 42042

0 some mods "all wheel drive" v6 instead straight 2 cylinder bucket instead gripper back lights and oldschool worngear mechanics instead of linear actuators edited by efferman, 26 december 2015 - 05:52 pm.

-1 cool mod by effe. but the original model out of the box is one of the poorest models tlg ever released. looks from front to rear as a cheaped out set with really lazy design effort. a shame for the responsible lego designer parts assortment seems to be ok but this should not be the most important criteria sry jim, i really appreciate your always very well done reviews and offen i agree with the overall judgements/verdicts and of course tastes are different but especially that review sounds like gushing praise in my ears.... just my 2 ct edit: ooops just saw the review isn't done by jim...<blush>... so sry jim... now my final comment belongs to mostlytechnic edited by kumbbl, 27 december 2015 - 07:33 am.

1 lego 42045 technic hydroplane racer thanks to lego and eurobricks for making this review possible! this was supposed to be a preview-review, before the dec 1 release date for the set, but it got stuck in customs or something and didn't arrive in time. well, i'd rather do a good, late review than a rushed review, so here it is. name: hydroplane racer set number: 42045 pieces: 180 price: $19.99 minifigs: 0 theme: technic year of release: 2016 links: bricklink brickset the box standard technic box. action photo, 2-in-1 logo, inset of functions. and the new "try our app" logo in the corner. the box back more standard stuff with the b-model and a larger app ad. the contents 3 bags, two manuals (yes, despite all the ads for their instructions app, they included printed manuals for both the main and b models!), a big sticker sheet, and two loose black beams. the interesting parts there's a lot of panels in this set. some are new colors (the blue curved panel) and the l-shaped blue panels are a new mold. i see them being used as mudguards on future sets (or maybe even this year; i haven't looked at the other 2016 technic sets in detail yet). the hose, soft axle 7 long in black is new as well. the normal 7 axle in yellow is a new color too, and i have no idea why it's in this set. both models use it in invisible places, so there's no reason other than making it easier to grab the right length axle to have it. i assume other sets this year are using it, but i'm not sure. the manual and the dumbing-down continues. now they have to show people to compare axle lengths to the 1:1 prints on the page that have always been there. but how does the 1:1 work on the app? might have to look into that... (for the record... i pulled out my phone and tried to find the app in the google store. couldn't find it. so then i went to the lego website shown on the page and it had a link to it. turns out it wasn't showing up because it's tablet only, so google wasn't showing it to me on my phone. i'll try again later with a tablet...) starting the build two technic standards. a bunch of pieces linked together to make a specific pattern of holes, and an engine block. some weirdness this felt very weird to me - making the crankshaft for the engine, they have you build it right to left. i don't know if it's because i'm a lefty or what, but it felt awkward. i need to look in some old manuals and see if it's always been this way... (nope! i randomly looked at 2013's set 42000 racer, and it builds it left to right.) assembling the core here's the core of the racer, upside down. the engine block, some gears at each end, and a couple boat studs for smooth gliding. and yes, they cheated and those are only attached on two studs instead of all 4. i'm always amazed at how lego geometry keeps finding interesting ways that it works. like here, with those boat studs. they fit perfectly into the bottom of the brick and against the beam. the front end up front we get a standard blue seat with a couple "hidden" wheels behind it. a boat doesn't typically have wheels, but these will drive the mechanisms of this model, so we'll let it slide. an odd part choice here though - in the very front there are two tan "axle pin without friction" parts holding that 3 long liftarm on. why? there's no need in either model for the non-friction pin, and there's lots of the normal blue axle pins in the set. so why include these two different pins? and all done! it looks like a huge jump here, but it's really not. the front and rear connect to each other, and then a bunch of big panels are added that make the model look way bigger. the stickers on this set really make it work. without them it's pretty bland and boring, so i recommend using them. from the rear at the back we have a fan to propel the boat. that's not so accurate. all the images i can find of real-life boats use props in the water. but since this is a non-floating model, we have to make some tweaks i guess. there also should be fins going down into the water for stability and hydroplaning, but again, had to drop that. here's an example of a real boat: you can see they nailed the overall look quite well. the underside for those that want to see the mechanicals, here's the underside of the model. minifig scale technic? nope, not quite. a fig will fit the seat, but sticks out of the cockpit and can't fit a helmet at all. so close... starting the b model again with the engine block, but this time an opposing 4 instead of inline. an odd part it's rare for lego to include parts specific to the b-model, so i was curious when i found this 2-axle with pin, a fairly new part. in the main model, it's used in a place that a normal 3 pin would have been fine, and it's the only one of these in the whole set, so it obviously must be needed in the b-model. sure enough, there's an assembly here that needs it: the front of the boat more upside-down building. and that silver piston is basically only there as a spacer. it has no real function. (yet.... it turns out later an axle goes into it, so it's a support for one end of the axle.) adding the wheels we keep building around the engine. this model uses the same wheel setup as the main model. taking shape the b-model instructions tell you to put the stickers on in case you haven't - they actually did a good job making the sticker work on either model. but the silver piston used as a cross-brace is a bit weird. it can spin, so that axle hole on the side ends up facing whatever way it wants. the back end the flex axles are used here under the panels just for appearance and to support the exhausts at the right angle. same fan propulsion as the main model, and just as wrong here :) worse, the gearing is switched. in the main model, the pistons and fan spin pretty quickly as you push the boat across the floor. in this one, they turn very slowly. more instruction weirdness i'm always curious at how lego decides to do instructions. here's how the panels on one side of the boat are assembled. for the mirror image on the other side, they tell you to put all 3 pins into the short panel as step 1 (2 black and a blue), add the white piece as step 2, and then add teh second panel and stickers as step 3. why two different ways? all done here's a similar angle as most of the official images. looks ok. i noticed though how obvious the wheels are. the back of the box image is a lower angle that hides them more. and i like the mudguard panels as seats. pretty clever. from the side i'm not fond of the profile. it doesn't sit level like i think it should. the wheels are a stud too low sticking out of the bottom. the underside like most b-models, there are compromises. there's pins and axles sticking out, but that's what you do when faced with a limited piece selection. minifig scale yet? nope, not quite. a bit too big this time. i think the driver is supposed to sit in the seat with knees over the front of the guard (where the grey pin is). so the minifig is way too small. spare pieces very few leftovers in this b-model. the conclusion so, what's my conclusion on this model? the b-model is fairly meh, and too similar to the main model. however, i love the hydroplane racer itself. it looks great and is very swooshable. for the price, it's surprisingly large thanks to the big panels on the sides, yes, this is one set that really needs the stickers to look good, but they look great and are well worth putting on. the ratings value: 9/10 - close to 10 cents a piece, and a fairly large model for the price. design: 9/10 - looks great other than the tiny fan on the back. minifigs: n/a - i was tempted to give a score since a minifig almost fits, but that'd be cheating. playability: 8/10 - not much functionality other than the engine and fan spinning, but very swooshable and sturdy enough to be played with. parts: 9/10 - a bunch of panels (including some new ones), just about every kind of technic pin, and quite a few thin liftarms . overall: 9/10 - the set is a solid winner, as long as your satisfied with the main model.

1 again, great review with superb pictures. the white and blue certainly works very well with your dark backdrop. thorough review for such a small model. small in size but great as a set. tell me, why did i let you review this one?!

0 quote and the dumbing-down continues. now they have to show people to compare axle lengths to the 1:1 prints on the page that have always been there. but how does the 1:1 work on the app? might have to look into that... (for the record... i pulled out my phone and tried to find the app in the google store. couldn't find it. so then i went to the lego website shown on the page and it had a link to it. turns out it wasn't showing up because it's tablet only, so google wasn't showing it to me on my phone. i'll try again later with a tablet...) funny thing is that they changed colour of 7l axle to yellow, and on that picture it still is in lbg.

-1 thanks for a great review! too bad there is only one blue curved panel in this set. my opinion on the frictionless axlepins is that the flex axle might be easier to stick in them than in regular/blue axlepins... didn't actually try it though :-) edited by majklspajkl, 05 december 2015 - 11:46 pm.

1 excellent review! i am glad that you did not rush this or the mine loader review. could it be that the fan in the back is like a turbo prop propulsion.... just reaching here. andy d

-1 thank you for the review. i have this one in my pile to build. i wish there was more of the curved blue panels though.

1 here is a video review via jang to add to the review: i like both a and b so will buy both.

1 review - 42038 - arctic truck introduction arctic vehicles aren't new to lego. back in 2000 the town theme already had several small orange arctic vehicles. in 2014 tlg again released a number of arctic sets in the city theme (formerly known as town). some of these sets are actually pretty big, containing over 700 parts. looking back in history it seems that arctic sets may have found their origin in the technic theme. although these sets were white instead of orange, they are unmistakenly arctic. the 1986 technic arctic sets contained the infamous technic figures. unfortunately the 2015 arctic truck doesn't contain any technic figures, but nonetheless it's great to see a new arctic vehicle in the technic line, not counting several snow scooters. let's see if the new arctic truck lives up to the expectations. note: all images can be clicked for hi-res versions. set information number: 42038 title: arctic truck theme: technic released: 2015 part count: 1219 box weight: 2110 gr box dimensions: 47,8 cm x 28,0 cm x 7,2 cm set price (msrp):  79,99 / us$ 84.99 /  59.99 price per part:  0,088 / us$ 0.093 /  0.066 links: brickset, bricklink the box the box measures 47,8 cm x 28,0 cm x 7,2 cm and weighs around 1385 grams. the box actually feels pretty heavy which means it's filled properly. this seems to be a trend in the technic theme. slightly smaller boxes can save shelf space for retailers. the front the front of the box shows the main model and in the lower right corner there's a image with the dimension of the model. it's 40cm long and 18cm wide. the back the upper part of the back of the box shows the functions of the main model. the lower left section shows the b-model, which looks very promising (more on that later). the lower right section shows the motorization options for the main model. the crane (partially) and the bed can be motorized. besides motorization some leds can be added as headlights. the side on of the sides shows one of the newer smaller style panels. this is the first time it appears in orange. when you take a look at the sticker you can see that it's not symmetrical. not sure why tlg "cut of" one of the sides of the stickers, since the position of the panel is very suitable for a continuous sticker. content of the box the box is pretty densely packed, which is better than semi-filled boxes. it feels like you actually bought something which matches the box size. the box contains: 2 booklets 1 sticker sheet 8 bags booklets & sticker sheet unfortunately the instructions and sticker sheet haven't been packed with cardboard protection, which results in a curved sticker sheet and slightly bent instructions. in my case this wasn't so bad. at least no real damage. highlighted parts this set proves to be a great parts pack, especially when you might have missed some of the 2014 sets. black link treads usually the link treads come in dark blue grey, but this sets includes 96 black treads, which is great if you'd like to replace the dbg ones in your mocs, or other official sets. undercarriage and suspension several parts are included to build the undercarriage driving the treads. four large tread sprockets and eight small tread sprockets, which are used as return sprockets. also included are four steering portal hubs and four steering portal axles for driving and steering the vehicle. several frames, including two c-shaped pivot frames and two steering ball joints to create an undercarriage much like the 4x4 crawler. the set even includes two h-shaped frames (a.k.a. dog bone frames). new changeover catch parts this year (2015) three new parts have been introduced to improve the changeover catch. more on these parts later. new pin connector another new part for this year (2015) is the "1l round pin connector", which looks like a pin connector, but acts more like a bush. new pins furthermore this sets includes quite a large number of three (relatively) new parts. 17 x pin with pin hole, 14 x 3l pin with 1l axle and 11 x 3l pin with 2l axle, which have been introduced this year (2015). when the new 3l pin with 1l axle was introduced in 2014 it was only a matter of time before the new 3l pin with 2l axle would appear. both new pins are a great addition to the parts portfolio. panels last but not least this sets contains a fair number of orange panels, including the 3x11 panel in orange, which is the first time we've seen this part. part list below is the entire part list for the 913 parts. as usual this part list can be found at the end of the second booklet. the build the build immediately starts with some of the new parts, used to build the compact gearbox in the center of the model. notice the two 20 tooth bevel gears. one would have been enough to drive the 12 tooth bevel gear, so the second seems to be useless. tlg probably used it in the a-model, because they needed it in the b-model, which you can see later. the front and rear suspension are almost identical. the front side also has the 13l gear rack, used for steering. the picture below shows the steering rack on the front suspension in more detail. at this point you have more or less finished the chassis. the gearbox is in place and the majority of the functions has internally been connected to the right gears. the small turntable shows where the crane will be attached later on. at the end of the first booklet, some of the bodywork has been attached to the chassis. the orange-black color scheme never fails to please me. throw in some cool stickers for the extra effect and we have a winner. if you decide to motorize the model, using pf, the top of the cabin can be lifted to accomodate the battery box. the chassis uses lots of orange (and some black) panels to give the model it's distinctive look. the protective black bumber/railing is a nice addition which adds something to the exterior. the dumping bed at the rear can tilt to empty it's load. it's operated by a mini la. the treads, which look very cool in black, are driven by a large tread sprocket and returned by two small tread sprockets. the front and rear sections are identical. building the undercarriages feels a bit repetitive, which is a problem for most tracked vehicles. finished model adding the crane to the model finishes the build. your model should look something like this. when you take a close look at the finished model, you realize this is something else. it's trully a unique vehicle. the color scheme is brilliant and the fact that it's an arctic truck is really neat. it's a welcome change for the technic line to see a vehicle like this. this picture emphasizes that's it's a very cool vehicle. imagine this beast plowing through the snow! as far as i know it's not based on a real life vehicle. if's probably a combination of several vehicles and some imagination. i can be totally wrong though. the rear of the vehicle shows the crane and drum, placed on the tipper bed. from this angle you can see some of the internals of the model, the gearbox behind the cabin for example. the crane can be partially motorized (rotation and base), while the boom is operated manually. what i like a lot is the protective railing around the vehicle. left over parts some leftover parts, nothing noteworthy. features and functions this set has several functions/features: steering driving suspension crane tipping bed steering as you can see in the image below the steering mechanism has quite a bit of negative caster (please correct me if i'm wrong), which causes the treads to rotate a bit upward/downward instead of only to the left and right. driving you mention driving as a feature?! yes i do and let me explain why. normally i would ommit this as a feature and take driving for granted. however, driving this vehicle (on a flat surface) causes it to simply slide over the surface. for other arctic vehicles this would be a plus, but with a tracked vehicle it limits playability. this is one of the main drawbacks of these tread, they simple don't work properly on smooth surfaces. suspension the suspension is working properly. you do need to apply some pressure, but all things considered it's not too bad. crane the crane has four degrees of freedom: base rotation lower boom upper boom hook it does what it's supposed to do. base rotation and lower boom can be motorized and switched using the gearbox, while the upper boom and hook are operated manually. tipping bed the tipping is operated via a mini la. conclusion while the set does offer various functions and features, driving and steering is a serious issue. therefor this set is more likely to be showcased than to be played with. b-model instructions for the b-model are of high quality. looking at the image below, you will see what i mean. here's the finished b-model, a tracked jeep with a communcations device. this alternate model looks so good, it could easily have made it as a main model. one thing that does pop in mind; how would this look with tires?! more on that later. when you are in the artcic region it's imperative to have proper communication channels. since there's no internet backbone, you will need a big antenna of some sort. this b-model actually features a small trailer wagon with a transmitter/receiver. here's more detailed image of the b-model, without trailer wagon. i would buy this model in a heartbeat if it were a main model. simply gorgeous. the side view doesn't give away that this in alternate model. the stickers also work really well in this model. and again, nothing to complain here. the model even has a small crane at the rear, operated by the mini la. here you can see the arctic fleet, comprised of both the a-model and b-model. i bet these two can get some work done!! a bit of a messy picture, but this should give you an impression of the size of both models. leftover parts not too many parts left, which is obviously a good thing. alternate model with tumbler tires just like me, you probably have been wondering how this model would look like with (tumbler) tires. well, here it is. as i imagined it does look great. admittedly, these are not the type of tires we ought to use, but to be honest; i don't really care. again, the negative caster results in quirky steering. the tires are a bit too big, so they hit the chassis when you compress the suspension. while this has absolutely nothing to do with an arctic vehicle, i really love this picture. summary we're almost at the end of my review, so what do i think of this set. let's start with getting the elephant out of the room; this set lacks proper driving and steering. does that make it a bad set?! definitely not! it's a great set, but it lacks some playability when it comes to moving the vehicle. the crane and tipper bed do work properly, so there's still some playability left. does this set look cool? definitely! i think it's one of the coolest (no pun intended) and most original models of recent years. the orange and black color scheme works great and the stickers are well designed. the b-model is of very high quality and some might even prefer it over the a-model. and if you are not interested in either of these models, this set provides you with a variety of great parts! all in all i think this is a great set! maybe not to play with, but it scores high on all other criteria. pros original model great color scheme lots of interesting parts great b-model cons steering and driving don't work too well repetitive build of undercarriages (minor con) score below are my scores based on different categories. 8 design original and good looking model. 7 building experience fun to build, albeit a bit repetitive. 8 features packs quite a few features. 7 playability some features work, some don't. 9 parts comes with interesting parts. 9 value for money two great model in a single set. 8 cool! as a bonus, here's picture of the main model with tumbler tires. why? because we can!

1 very timely review jim. my wife has just surprised me by giving me this set a few days ago and i have just built the a model two days ago and b model yesterday. i agree with all that you wrote above. i don't have tumbler tires but i have 9398 tires. driving is smooth but steering + suspension will be bad as you said due to negative caster and tires hitting the chassis. anyway, tonight i will destroy the b model and rebuilt this http://www.busterhau...8-c-model.html.

-1 the set is a looker, you've got to admit it, but what it gives in looks does not make up for what it lacks in functions. i really wanted this set, badly even, when i restarted my adventure with technic about a month ago. than i learned more and more about what a good model can do, mostly thanks to this forum and yt. right now i'm a bit disappointed with the arctic truck - smaller sets offer more functions and teach you much more. jim it was a great review nevertheless edited by pgplay, 14 december 2015 - 11:22 am.

1 great review. i bought this model several weeks ago and the box has sat on my shelf, so i think after this i will be digging it out for christmas and i expect my son will have a lot of fun with it when it's built. ps. these tumbler tyres look amazing on this model, and indeed amazing in their own right!

0 how about this one: ps i somehow didn't find this picture when i wrote my review.

0 i could be wrong but i am 100% sure that i've seen this review before.

0 you switched the sides for the panel with the unsymmetrical sticker. otherwise you would see that the cut off part is where there's a beam in front of the panel. that's probably done because the beam could possibly damage the sticker, either while building or while placed against it for a long time. or it's simply omitted because it wouldn't be (completely) visible

1 great review and pictures as always. its an odd combo, but i agree that the b model looks good with tumbler tires therize, on 14 december 2015 - 09:32 pm, said: i could be wrong but i am 100% sure that i've seen this review before. i believe jim posted the same one in the reviewers academy

1 until i saw photos of this set i wasn't convinced i wanted it. now after seeing all the combinations (a+b and tumbler tires!) i am definitely buying two copies. i need orange parts and black treads anyway. the only problem i have with this is that it's going to encourage me to buy many copies of the drag racer just to get enough wheels to play with.

-1 jim/anyone....i built this set a few days ago, i dont like the way the crane arm section has no knob to turn the mini turntable. you see the 20 tooth gear?....there is a pinhole located next to this....i would like to add something here to make it easier to turn the winch section.

-1 i have the 42038, nice set but i found the tipping of the bed clumsy. it was a pleasure to build and i do like the build with the tumble wheels

1 thank you jim, nice review its a great set: a lot unique parts and not just pins, axles and beams. i bough it to bring me back to lego from my da (10 years)... ps. soon i will post an alternative model

1 you wrote a very accurate review of this set, jim. it's a pretty good model (with some obvious problems) but it's an even better parts pack. your pictures with the tumbler tires are great. what is the material of the gray background? nerdsforprez, on 15 december 2015 - 01:26 pm, said: lets not forget the c-model made by buster haus. pretty sweet c model..... thank you for the mention.

1 review - 42001 - mini off-roader introduction technic mini models are sometimes regarded as models not worth buying. i don't agree with this opinion. whether it's a special part or innovative building technique, almost every mini model has something that makes the set worthwhile. this time i will be reviewing the 42001 mini off-roader. this model is not a smaller version of an existing model, so there's no real comparison with a bigger brother, or sister if you will. nor does the model resemble a real life brand or vehicle, so it is what it is, a mini off-roader. note: all images can be clicked for hi-res versions. set information number: 42001 title: mini off-roader theme: technic released: 2013 part count: 100 box weight: 165 gr box dimensions: 15,5 x 14,0 x 4,2 cm set price (msrp): 9.99 eur de / 7.99 gbp / 12.99 usd price per part: de 0.100 eur / uk 0.080 gbp / usa 0.130 usd links: brickset, bricklink the box the box measures 15,5 x 14,0 x 4,2 cm which is obviously not very big. the weight of the box is approximately 165 grams. frontside the front of the box shows a though four wheel drive off-roader challenging a fierce rocky mountain trail...now does it?! what the box actually shows is mini off-roader challenging a small foam rock formation, much like rocks used in star trek the original series, yet smaller the box also states that this model is for the age of 7 till 14. more importantly, the 2-models in-1 logo is clearly visible, which means this set can be used to build two different models. backside the backside shows a picture of the alternate model and a smaller version of the original model. the conversion arrow and the 2-in-1 are printed to clarify that the main model can be converted into a secondary model. sides one of the sides shows the 2-in-1 logo and a picture of the main model. another side shows a picture of one of the wheels in actual size and again, a picture of the main model. contents of the box the box contains: 2 booklets 2 bags 4 tires booklets this set contains two booklets which is not very common for a set this size. both models share the same chassis, which is why the build has been divided over two booklets, one for the chassis (8 pages with 10 steps) and one for the bodywork (34 pages with 23 steps for the main model and 20 steps for the alternate model). bags the box contains only 2 bags which is to be expected from a set consisting of 100 parts. one of the bags is filled with liftarms, panels, rims and two elastic bands. the other bags contains all the other parts, like pins, axles, connectors, etc. opening the bags results in the following collection of parts, with the exception of the tires. no abundant number parts that will add real value to your collection. nevertheless, there are some interesting orange parts and elastic bands. tires the tires are provided seperately (i.e. not contained in the bags). from the picture you can see that these tires have a front and a back side, so you should pay attention when fitting them to the rims, which have two different sides as well. highlighted parts this section describes the unique and/or highlighted parts. very small smooth technic panel (#21 and #22) these two small technic were new at the time of release and this set was only one of two sets containing them in orange. the other set is the 42007 - moto cross bike. at the moment of writing there's a third set containing these parts, the black champion racer. side a side b small rubber band i was under the impression that these white rubber bands weren't that common, but it seems that these bands are as common as dirt. but hey, you can't have enough rubber bands! thin liftarm 1x5 with axle holes like the panels, these liftarms were also new at the time of release. looking at the the frequent usage in other sets, this part has proven to be a most useful mammal. thin liftarm 1x3 not a very rare piece per se, but if you are not into bionicle, this liftarm part can be hard to find. your other option would be to buy the 9390 - mini tow truck, or the 8305 - dual bikes from a while ago (2000). long pin with center pin hole this relatively new kid on the block is currently used in many technic and non-technic sets and has well proven it's worth. axle pin connector hub with 2 axles like the previous part this newish part is also quite helpful in certain situations. part list here's the complete list for all 100 parts. building experience the build starts with the chassis of the off-roader. after connecting some liftarms two elastic bands, one on each side, are attached to the towball pins. this is all there is to the suspension, plain and simple. the two elastic bands contract the l-shaped liftarms, which results in the long ends swiveling downwards. the video below demonstrates the suspension. the simplicity doesn't do it justice, because it works like a charm. the suspension is very smooth with the right amount of stretch and resistance. this great working suspension adds a lot of value to this set. to quote john hurt in the movie contact: "why build one when you can have two at twice the price?". i have purchased two sets so we can simultaneously see both models and make a proper comparison. below you can see two identical chassis which will be used for both versions of the build. at this stage we have arrived at the end of the first booklet, which only took about ten minutes. not surprising, since the first booklet only has 10 building steps. progressing to the second booklet, you need to choose between building the main and alternative model. that's a choice i don't need to make for this review, so let's start with the main model. main model when building the bodywork there's a rather peculiar building technique, which you wouldn't expect in an official lego set. the axle and pin connector hub with 2 axles only protrudes halfway into the double bent liftarm. the thin 1x4 liftarm which is added in one of the following steps makes sure the hubs stay perfectly in place, but i was still surprised to see this technique. the finished bodywork for the main model looks like....uhh...well.....i don't know exactly. it doesn't bear any resemblance to a real life model, which makes it hard to judge. one thing's for sure; it's not the best looking technic mini model. the bodywork can be attached to the chassis by using a 7l axle and two bushes, one on each side of the chassis. alternate model unfortunately the alternate model doesn't look much better than the main model. it's even a stud less wide, while you would like to see slightly more body, matching the size of the tires and chassis. attached to the chassis the body is even more out of proportion. it's not really ugly and the color scheme is great (obviously this goes for the main model as well), but the body simply doesn't match the chassis. i can only imagine that this model is supposed to have a chibi look, much like the microfighter star wars models. comparison the following section shows a selection of images from different angles to compare the main and secondary model. the main model has a bit more volume, while the alternate model has a more sporty look. front view the main model has headlights which are attached at a higher point, while the alternate model has headlights which are placed more closely next to each other. rear view a slightly different setup in both models, where the main model again has higher placed rear lights. side view the side view shows that the panels are used differently in both models. the main models uses them as doors, while the alternate model uses them as engine cover (bonnet). top view the top view reveals that the main model might have room for a minifig parts left the left image shows the parts which are left after building the main model, while the second image shows the parts left after building the alternate model. as you can see, the main model uses slightly more parts than the alternate model. features besides the awesome suspension, which we already have discussed, there aren't a lot of features in this set. there's actually a single feature, which is only present in the main model....opening doors! wow, impressive! well, maybe we can't expect too much functionality in such a small model. summary the off-roader is a fun model which is fairly easy to build. the suspension is simple, yet very effective. the model could do better in the design department, but the suspension offers great playability and that is what this set is all about. the orange parts are not very common so they are an added bonus. all things considered this set is definitely worth the few bucks you need to spend on it. pros great suspension fun to play with some (semi) rare orange parts great color scheme cons no resemblence to an actual off-roader not the best looking model score below are my scores based on different categories. 6 design not the best looking technic model. 7 building experience the suspension makes it fun to build. 7 features the suspension makes up for the lack of functionality. 8 playability the model has car-swooshability. 7 parts some interesting orange parts. 8 value for money great present for the younger builders. 7,1 elastic hope you enjoyed it! thanks for reading and please rate this set at the top of this topic!

1 once again, excellent review jim! than you for not skipping this small but pretty great set. i also got two of this and i have to say, i really admire the nifty suspension. building a third bodywork for the same suspension system is still on my backlog.

0 sad, i miss this set.

1 here is the review...for broadside's brig 6259! a set from 1991, with a handsome count of 64 pieces, 3 figures, and a sale price of $8.75! the building(and parrot): we'll start off with the front. it looks like a good solid building to hold those scurvy dogs! we yonder over to the left side: and see a nice open back: and yonder to the plain right side: back to the left, we find the corner, with a nice area to rest your tired soldiers! we see the platform in the corner, a lovely place for soldiers to stand on! it's a bit...skimpy, so watch your step! the middle is blocked by some stones, assuring security! but still open enough to stand in! the jail is cramped, and fits only two people, but we only need one prisoner in this set :-) ! moving up is the watch tower, a place for your soldier stand and stand watch or for silly parots to sit on! here's the front middle part, again those stones blocking the way! figures and accesories: we have a delightful number of a soldier, a sailor, and a scurvy pirate! a lovely parot! and a generous assortment of weapons! that concludes our review. overall: it's a fantastic little set, and great for army and supplies and bricks gathering! i can't find any faults with this set, it's just the neatest little thing you've seen in a port *wub* highly recomended *y* . and to end our review: a comic!

0 the poll doesn't allow you to select 2 from 1-5. it instead says 1, 3, 3, 4, 5. but besides that, your review i give it a 5 because 1) shows the set in all angles 2) shows the characters 3) comment on the little creature comforts of the set 4) added a comic (playability) 5) showed true enthusiasm *y* *wub*

0 the poll is for the set, not the review :-d . but thank you anyway! and it appears mister phes made the mistake :-p !

-1 i'd give a 2, but you put 3 two times. is a nice set but is not really cool. is a worse version of lagoon lock up

1 a nice little set. silly parrots on!

1 great review, cool comic. *wub* i give the set a four, and i will go and buy it now as i am missing many of those parts.... oh it's not for sale? off to bricklink then! :-d

1 how much was it again? for the price it looks really solid. if u add the prison to the back it looks real good.

0 rupeeclock, on nov 21 2007, 01:13 pm, said: well i only know the european price: 89.99 euros i think that's quiet expensive against the 2005 police station (7237): 74.99 euros - rupeeclock u.s. price is $89.99. already for pre-order at amazon.

1 hello, well as this is my first review i hope you like it. the 7744 police station is simply fanstastic. the many minifigs and the vehicles makes it really nice. the great playabillaty and and great space makes it great for children i think. but latest but not least the pics! general overview: the front of the box: the back of the box: inside the box: top of the box: instructions: the minifigs: the cars: patrol car: dog car: the dog: the motor: well now the police station : the mailbox: the crime report room: the handcuffs holder: handcuff: suspect who wears handcuffs: jails: satelite: little things: water machiene: and if you don?t like water, we have coffee to!: well and as last: the interrogation room: well this was the review. i hope you liked it! bye

1 i got most of the sets from '07, they're pretty cool.

1 thanks for the review, it's a neat little set. i hope it comes to australia sooner rather than later. that minifig head was also used in 7699 mt-101 so that may be why it seems familiar.

1 thanks for the review! *sweet* aside from the fact that i like the model, this set has a few new and useful pieces so i will have to get it! *wub*

1 a wonderful set and, perhaps, as close to classic space as possible. *y* also there?s a great amount of very useful and interesting parts too like these round 'stabilizer' parts with clip.... :'-) there?s a complete different feeling with this new sets compared to the first mm ones.... 8-| beside the a little more realistic aspects of it with the more enclosed cockpit (nearly with some controls.... ;-) ) it?s the overall more solid feeling i guess.... the other sets look pretty neat and fashionable at the surface, but their internal structure is much more hollow and useless with some studless technic beams and such stuff.... very shining, but hard and boring to mod, just aimed for maximal cool looking box art and the rest went down for saving costs.... (beside that already pretty good 7692 dropship that is). the only thing i don?t get with that is why the minirobot?s a one-armed one.... ach, pirates on mars i suppose.... x-d

1 that head might have been from rock raiders. lovely set, and a good review. jifel

0 hmm, not actually a bad set. not high on my 'to buy' list, there're other things up there first, but definitely a possibility somewhere down the line. thanks for the review.

-1 tks for the great review mm ;-) its always appreciated to have reviews of new set. having said that i really don't see the point of that set and its such money and time wasted imo. i don't like that theme apart the dropship and 6wheeler and that tiny vehicle doesn't do the trick for me. i see it as a really cheap excuse to try and please classic space fan with that horrendous mm graphics and what amazes me is that you guys loke that :-d money saved on !! *yoda*

1 thanks for posting the picture of this new mm set. when i first saw the mars mission sets i was a little apprehensive about the design and the aliens (they could have at least make movable arms :(), but anyways when i bought the small fighter i was totally hook. my fave set from the line is the mech.

1 during the annual thanksgiving road trip to the relatives, i stopped by the tru in portland, or. lo and behold, the new mars mission sets! predictably, i bought them. i present to you: the mx-41 switch fighter! man, what a long name. the box: standard mm. on the front, it shows the fighter in flight mode, and a yellow note telling you that it transforms. the back shows three pictures showing it happen. the parts: once i open the box, the first thing that comes out is a bent and rolled up instruction booklet, and i was forced to put it under a stack of beer books for an hour. then, there's the dss. yes, two of the stickers do feature a cobra. i wonder why, because this set's decal should be a beatle. x-d decent parts, nothing too special. then, i noticed this little part. it's used for the flick-missiles, but i have no idea what else it would be used for. :-/ the build: the alien ship: when i looked at the box art for this set, i was releived to see that the aliens don't have another curved-forward wing ship. instead, they have this little beauty, which appears to be the alien mini cooper- small and hot. *wub* anyway, partially completed. even if you don't like the set, it has some nice green flame peices, which work nicely for space laser swords. fully completed. the only annoying bit about it is that the crystal-holding thing in front wobbles all over the place. the alien fits into it by way of impalement. it must hurt getting in and out. switch fighter (cockpit): the set makes good use of the alpha team cockpit. for controls, it has a meagre handlebar that the astronaught can't even reach. the rear "shell" of the fighter starts out around the alien containment chamber. it's a bit odd that the containment chamber has an alien sticker, because the instruction booklet lists it as holding crystals. the crystal canister is held back by a technic pin. this is, without a doubt, the ugliest color arrangment ever. warning: mass stickers. :-x the cockpit fits into grooves in the "shell". then it clicks into place in a 1x1 brick with a horizontal clip. the wing "mechanism": the wing. for some reason, the body of the "mechanism" has a blue brick. *wacko* the wing and "mechanism" connect to prevent the fighter doing a nosedive while in tank mode. the wing "mechanism" completed: the underside: the body and wing connect by way of a miscolored red brick. i have no idea why it's red- black would bave been much, much better. completed. tank mode: all in all, this looks pretty neat. the wheel base is pretty short, but it's not bad. transform! the set transforms neatly, if ungainly. without "anti-grav" support, it would fall forward on it's nose each time it transformed. jet mode. it's all right, but it could be a bit better. the "shell" keeps slipping back forward to the "tank mode" because there's nothing to stop it sliding. spare parts: overall: i thought this set was great. it could do with some fixing, such as the mismatched colors, but it should be a definate buy for mm fans. brickshelf gallery (when available)

0 *wub* thanks for another great review. *sweet* i am also glad that it is a very different alien fighter design as i already have three varients of the old type! the fighter transforms better than i thought it would; i was expecting just the wings. i should be buying this set as well... mr. mandalorian, on nov 26 2007, 03:45 pm, said: without "anti-grav" support, it would fall forward on it's nose each time it transformed. well, since anti-grav doesn't exist, and will never exist, there has to be another option! looking at it in tank mode it does have a vague aerofoil shape so i think it should be able to work as a lifting body. all it needs to do then is move fast enough to start taking off and then it can extend the wings... 8-|

"how can it support itself without anti-grav while transforming?" the answer? it can't *sweet* :-p

1 very cool review, mr. mandalorian! this isn't a bad set, the alien craft is very sleek (if only they'd gone with the old alien body in trans-green...) and the transforming is alright. the tank mode looks sweet. *sweet* ~peace

0 after seeing this set review it change my mind about this set. by the way thanks for the great review.

1 thanks for a very thorough review. i might think about getting this. i really like the mini alien fighter, and the transformation idea is always a welcome one. both modes look pretty good, despite the some of the odd coloured bricks (which i'd mod out). you know what it reminds me of? some of the futuristic designs in the gerry anderson series.

1 wow. this is actually quite a neat set! it is definitively my favorite in the line after the big drilling unit! \begin{geek} i'm not sure it would nose dive when transforming from tank mode. i guess it would pick up speed and transform quickly since it doesn't seem to have any downwards pointing thrusters. \end{geek}

1 i really like the transforming aspect of this! the one thing i wish mm sets would include would be baseplates. i liked that about the classic space stuff because it really helped create the environment. some "red rock orange" mars baseplates would be great!

-1 great review mr mandalorian! *y* i'm not a fan of mm and don't like this set much, but it has some neat features. but the only way i can see it transforming is by racing off a cliff and swinging its wings out *wacko* to the brickmobile! >:-)

1 great review hinckley! i know you've been busy, so thank you so much for getting this up! :-d the spine construction is clever, the minirobot's cool, this is a fantastic set! ~peace

1 thanks hinckley! it's always nice to see your reviews, and i can't wait to see the story mode (from the pic, i guess it will include sinner and hinckley, instead of bianca and gavin, right? 8-| ) luxorv

1 thanks for this fantastic review hinckley, i can't wait to see the comic! :'-) i really love this mech as i am a fan of non-bipedal mechs (though i am terrible at making them), the purple is great and i can't wait to see what mocers will use those awesome new spike peices for! 3 robots in one mech is a really good deal too, and that spider droid just adds so much more to the set. and thanks for taking the time to do this! *sweet* not to sound like a smartypants though, but the grill peice in purple is not the first time this has happened, two were included in the 06 joker helicopter ;-) thanks again! to the brickmobile! >:-)

1 awesome reveiw thanks for the pics!! did the instructions come with a comic?

1 thanks for that very neat review, hinckley! *y* this set looks indeed very interesting, with a very cool antlike look and a simple but essential overall design. the cockpit seems better protected than many other ef ones, that spine?s lovely and the way these iron drones?re attached is simple but effective. :-) and hey, did i miss something or?re there really no crappy shooting devices...? :-p thanks to the minirobots and their inventor i guess.... :'-)

0 thanks everyone! i'm glad you are enjoying the review. i'm working on the 8118 right now and will have comics up for both starting tonight. hayatoson, on nov 27 2007, 04:02 am, said: awesome reveiw thanks for the pics!! did the instructions come with a comic? the instructions do not have a comic, but i always write one for my reviews featuring my sig-fig or other fabuland creatures interacting with the new set...

0 don't forget bianca and gavin, o' lordship of pies! :-d truly another excellent review! the pictures are absolutely splendid, as usual! i'm really glad those air-vent pieces were done so well. while i remain skeptical about the new giant spikes, you've sold me on this set! i can't wait to see the fabuland comic and your final verdict, hink!

1 that's a very interesting set... and with all that purple a must buy. i decided recently that i am going to resist buying lego unless it's on sale next year, but i have so little purple.... 8-| i love the little robot! :-p thanks for the photos hinckley and i look forward to the comic! *sweet* (as sir dillon said, some of the links appear dead but i suspect it is a server error... :-/ )

0 i too got an error message when clicking on the images, but the text links work correctly 8-| i wonder which way gavin will meet his death this time :-d luxorv

0 8118 hybrid rescue tank review enjoy guys! i am working on more. maybe we'll have the 8112 battle arachnoid next. the comics will be around eventually. sorry for all the delays and the teasing. i appreciate your patience!!

0 great almost finished review *y* thanks for doing these, since you are probably busy however my favorite part is missing, the comic!! :-d interesting set, however i never liked exoforce but i like the parts wait on! piranha

0 dark sword ragnarok, on nov 27 2007, 08:08 pm, said: sweet. caant wait for all of these sets to show up in the u.s. uh... he got that in the us.

1 another great review, hink! looks like a great set. quote the cockpit isn't sealed and is actually aggravatingly unrealistic as it leaves the drivers chest vulnerable to enemy fire. actually the cockpit lacks any controls as seen here where it looks like keiken is simply pounding a counter demanding food. :-d "gimme food! or else my friend up there willl shoot your punk- @$$ into mars!" well, i guess that explains why there are no robot snipers in ef. if there were, well.... wouldn't be much of a story, would there? x-d

0 darnit, hinckley! >:-( you always make us wait for the comic, which is almost everyones favorite part! >:-( |-/ x-d i just noticed ryos uniform had a camo pattern. with all the orange he has, it's kinda pointless. edited by lt. veers, 28 november 2007 - 04:48 am.

0 john cleese, on nov 27 2007, 11:26 pm, said: this designers were on a roll with this one until it came to the flying unit. it looks like a shambles, epecially the guns looking rather simplistic. although they used something similar to the light and sound globe peice, which is kind of neat. i dont think i'll be buying this but your review almost talked me into it. cool! but my reviews are not meant to sway anyone. they should just inform people further as if they want to buy it or not. i am not necessarily for encouraging anyone to buy every set i review. :-d but i'm glad you liked it. thank you. and actually i did feel the same way you did about the flying module, until i put sinner in it and started to play. here's a sneak peek of the comic and a cool feature of ryo's ship-it can be configured in a lot of different ways:

0 sinner, on nov 28 2007, 12:53 am, said: how well do the tracks work? the last tank was too light and it didn't roll well at all. :-/ it's similar in weight but i didn't have to press down so hard to get the treads to move, barely at all, really. i think the mobile defense tank, although a better overall design, suffered from the odd angle of the treads and that was mostly why the treads didn't turn well. plus, what was with those weird exhaust pipes?? anyway, they are both cool tanks although i like the mobile defense tank better... :-)

1 thank you for the glimps at the new set hinckley *y* . i saw this set today at my local tru store. the new slope 1x2 pieces look very *sweet* . i definitly see great potential for these pieces on locomotives. i hope these are going to be bountiful in the 2008 lines. model on!!

1 hinckley, on nov 28 2007, 06:48 am, said: cool! but my reviews are not meant to sway anyone. they should just inform people further as if they want to buy it or not. i am not necessarily for encouraging anyone to buy every set i review. :-d but i'm glad you liked it. thank you. oh i know but without the info i definately wouldnt buy it, now i'm considering it. hinckley, on nov 28 2007, 06:48 am, said: and actually i did feel the same way you did about the flying module, until i put sinner in it and started to play. here's a sneak peek of the comic and a cool feature of ryo's ship-it can be configured in a lot of different ways: x-o ........................................ sinner fits in there. well, i'm sold. x-d

0 thank you for the review hinckley :-) already waiting for the comic x-d

0 i think this is probably my least favourite set of next years selection, but i still might get it, partly because of this review (thanks, btw). i quite like the mini-robot, and while there are a few problems (the front cockpit, the exposed axles) i relish the idea of moding them out, and correcting them. and the change back to the original figs is welcome. i didn't really get any of this years sets, only last years. makes it easier from a mocing potential, anyway.

0 jifel, on dec 2 2007, 08:37 am, said: crap! >:-( now i have to spend all my money on this! *wub* *wub* and whats the code? oh well, awesome set, and judt curios, didnt the reviewers used to be bianca and gavin? jifel yes they did! *sweet* i like using me and sinner better, though. i have put fabuland housewives on the back burner for a while, but plan to revive it for the first season conclusion in january. it's nice to see that there are people who really follow it out there. thanks! :-$

1 thanks for this new review, hinckley *wub* for me, it was love at fistr sight with this little set :-p it's simple but nice, and way better than shadow crawler for a spider-like mech *y* you sure will be very busy these days, and your characters will get breakdown before they finish filming all the comics x-d luxorv

1 thanks for that neat review of a very nice set. the color scheme?s great and that minirobot looks very comical and funny indeed, sweet! *sweet*

1 awesome! thanks hinckley! i was not planning to get this set but now it look as if i will have too. (i still cannot afford it anyway) :'-(

1 i would agree. the spider looks really cool. too bad we can't see how the combo mech looks like. instructions are not online yet. :-/ there should be another combo mech but you'll need the storm lasher set. :-p

1 hinkley, you are the man! your reviews just keep on getting better and better! although all of the sets this year are great and i love them all to bits, i can't say there was one that i absolutely felt like something i'd buy except for the storm lasher. but with this review, i think this will be the first purchase of 2008 for me! i totally agree with you on how the spider looks better without mini-robot. but from looking at where the cockpit is placed and how the skull on the cockpit is lodged underneath the walker, maybe the mini-robot would look better mounted underneath the head? that way it looks more even and even gives the thing a nasty set of teeth! i gotta try it out once i get it. can't wait for the fabuland comics! keep it up, hink!

1 cool! another *y* *y* *y* *y* *y* *y* out of *y* *y* *y* *y* *y* and could you post a pic of all the minirobots and planes

-1 thanks for the review, although i still have no intentions of buying this, it's neat to know what's inside, the build etc... (the etc being the comic ;-) x-d ) it's wierd because i dont know what it is i dont like about this set.

1 oh, i just *wub* theat mini-bot. creepy, but strangely cute... nice piece selection, and the idea of something with rotors that double up as cutters storming (no pun intended) through the jungle ripping it apart is just fantastic (to me, anyway). i'm liking the new swords as rotors blades, that's pretty innovative, and the exhaust pipe pieces are intriguing.

1 thanks for the review, hinckley! i like the set it looks good, and all those ork swords..... *wub*

0 zero1312, on dec 6 2007, 09:48 am, said: yes, when in 2008 do these sets come to germany? :-/ um i do not know, i live in the u.s.a. *sweet*

0 exo-builder59, on dec 6 2007, 11:11 pm, said: um i do not know, i live in the u.s.a. *sweet* sorry, my bad! :-/

1 fantastic review! i'll post my views on the set later when i have more time. but i've already fixed the poll.

1 nice review! hmm...i gave it a 4...why? very good bits: -3 epaulettes for 3 gurads! -patterned wall parts -cannon bad bits: -no pirates to fight -title is rather grand for an outpost -top needs battlements, not very low lattices -needs a more substantial base - the wall goes right into the sea! - surely the whole thing would sink... -palm tree is too short ...and the rest is good! :-p you might want to fix the vote option for 5 - it appears to be the title; you can't vote for it... pirate king skelly killer edit: ok, boney, but i gave it a 4! edited by slyowl, 06 december 2007 - 07:32 pm.

0 bonaparte, on dec 6 2007, 07:29 pm, said: fantastic review! i'll post my views on the set later when i have more time. but i've already fixed the poll. thanks, bonaparte! thank you for the comments people!

1 you even have the box! splendid review. i also own this one, and i think there's nothing to complain about. (more figs would be appreciated though, a sneaky pirate perhaps) 4 out of 5!

1 thanks for that nice review, it?s a 5 for me.... just a great little blue coats set, perfect for army and fortress building. *sweet*

1 i remember buying this set and thinking what an amazing job lego had done. it was my first pirate set and i still have it built. *sweet*

1 i gave it a 5, it has some nice pieces at a reasonable price. thanks for this review, and the pictures are great! *sweet*

1 thank you for the comments! *sweet* i wonder who voted "1", surely such a nice set doesn't deserve such a low score!? *wacko*

1 it's not a bad thing to vote sabre island 1 if someone feels that it's genuinely worth 1 but t'would be interesting to know why.

0 remind us what aberbrick is mr radar... or better still give us a link and give your moc plug x-d

0 bonaparte, on dec 8 2007, 09:40 pm, said: i gave this one a 5. *snip* it can be used as a small independent base or in combination with one of the bigger sets (eldorado or trading posts) as a lookup or outer defense.*snip* i hope that when i got eldorado fortress for christmas (the one i got for ?25) i can somehow combine the two to make a single larger base. i will post pics of the results one day if all goes to plan.

1 lord of pies, on dec 6 2007, 08:24 pm, said: but never fear, the lord of pies is here! me throwing a pie at captain ironhook from another angle. lol (somehow i cannot add a clickeble smilie) i never had this set when i was young, but i bought it some years ago second hand. it is a nice in between piratesoldierset and i like it very much.

0 lord of pies, on dec 6 2007, 07:24 pm, said: the top of the tower is rather plain and simple which in some ways is good, as it keeps the whole set detailed yet not crowded, but i feel a little something should of been added to the top though. perhaps a catapult? steve

0 athos, on jan 2 2008, 10:59 pm, said: perhaps a catapult? steve hmm, maybe, although a catapult doesn't really fit in to that time period all that well.

1 i liked the set, but it could have done more, plus the strange price of 15.50 just seems odd. must be the modern pricing systems *wacko* another rowboat with a pirate would have been good *y* *y* *y* out of *y* *y* *y* *y* *y*

0 lord of pies, on jan 3 2008, 08:51 pm, said: what a wonderful idea.... :-p a pie catapult! although it is a waste of a pie....we have ourselves a dilemma! there's plenty of stale, moldy old, maggot infested grog around eldorado fortress, perhaps that's worth wasting on the scurvy sea-dogs afterall my men have taken to eating only coconuts brought by islander girls in their skimpy undies! x-d

1 its a fantastic set, cant think of anything wrong with it to be honest, even if the island is a bit small, the plate itself is still useful, and the rest of it is also very useful, walls can go toward a bigger fort, cannon can extend your ship, soldiers extend your army, boat extends err your boats, and the island prin is just cool

1 its a nice set. i would not mind owning one, just for the minifigs and cannon. the base plate is pretty cool as well. nice review, i gave it a 4 out of 5.

1 :'-) i really love everything you did with this gas station. it looks very cozy!!! amazing how you said you built it by the book, does that mean you didn't have the set but you used your own pieces to rebuild the thing? the flourescent lighting is genius! and the interior space looks just like what you'd see at those little shops. i really dig the moc ;-) it gives me good ideas and now i want a gas station of my own :-p and the history behind how it was "rebuilt" and how it will improve business etc is so cool *wub*

1 legobear, on dec 8 2007, 11:32 pm, said: ... does that mean you didn't have the set but you used your own pieces to rebuild the thing? ... thanx legobear. it means that i have the complete set and have kept it complete until yesterday x-d since i like the set so much, i wanted to keep the general look of it :-) p edited by phred, 09 december 2007 - 06:27 am.

1 that?s a be-au-ti-ful station! it looks perfect from head to toe ;) you managed to keep the original feeling, yet enhanced it to match the spirit of todays city sets. congratulations! and i love your milkman truck! :d

1 that's a beautiful upgrade of a classic set! the new interior is great. *wub* do you still have the tow truck?

1 a wonderful work and a neat idea with that propane tank refilling station. *y* very detailed and very charming indeed! :'-)

0 thanx for the compliments :-$ stauder, on dec 9 2007, 01:47 am, said: ...

0 he's doing a review of temple escape now. edited by indy565, 16 december 2007 - 12:29 am.

1 thank you big pete *wub* this set looks very good, it looks well built and the statues are nice. the ark looks great and the star wars hieroglyphic is classic :-d just a two things: is marion's face double sided? it looks like a calm face on the back of the box. where do the snakes come out? and about the stickers, have you tried putting them on the long bricks above the breakable walls? once again, thanks very much *wub* *y*

0 tinypiesrus, on dec 16 2007, 12:39 am, said: is marion's face double sided? it looks like a calm face on the back of the box. yes it is ... i never noticed until i just checked! :-$ will post a pic of the alternate face when my camera battery is charged :) quote where do the snakes come out? they sit on a pivoting plate behind the star wars heiroglyphics. you press down on a brick at the back and the plate drops and they fall out from underneath. quote and about the stickers, have you tried putting them on the long bricks above the breakable walls? well, yes ... that was where i guessed they were meant to go ... but really ... there is no mention of this in the instructions! edited by big pete, 16 december 2007 - 12:49 am.

1 thanks for the review! it looks awesome, and 10 snakes! is that box the ark though? thanks again! ~peace

1 outstanding! i can't believe you found one! i'd bet hinckley would be surprised about this.

0 marion's other face!

1 db24, on dec 16 2007, 02:09 am, said: thank you for the great review! looks like a very nice set, so many snakes!! 10 in all ... 5 green, 5 red

1 thanks for that cool review, big pete! *y* a very interesting set with a great playability and that sw sticker?s just hilarious! snake shower on! :-d

1 big pete, on dec 15 2007, 09:07 pm, said: marion's other face! that is an amazing figure!!!! i'm definitely getting that! thank you! *wub*

1 lol! those star wars heiroglyphics are awesome! were those in the movie? or is this just a joke by the lego designers? that would be the first time tlc showed any kind of reference humor! the rest of the set is great too, even the skeleton and the stickers. yes, that's right, i actually like those things. i like the new skellies because of their posability (i'm a big supporter & user of stop-motion) and i think there's nothing wrong with stickers. i mean seriously, why does everybody hate stickers so much??? :-| sure, they are a pain in the megablocks to put on and, sure, they come off after a while and are never usable again, but hey, you don't have to put them on, even better, you can save them (like i do) and use them for your mocs! could somebody tell me, please? i'm just curious. however, as i said, nice set! i might even get one. gotta love that marion with the carot torch x-d and that arc is neat too! by the way, are all parts on it golden? some more pics on it would be nice as soon as your camera is recharged! ;-) thanks. peace out!

1 this and motorcycle chase were the two sets i've wanted from the start. i like how you get lots of snakes, and i'll add my snakes in too, for a brickfilm. sometimes i like the stickers, but all my world city ones got hard and fell off :'-( i like the r2-d2. could you take a pic of any hieroglyphics in this set(not the ones on the sticker sheet.) thanks. i want to decode them.

1 my 2nd review (what a veteran) ... again, found this set via a shop assistant, in my local tru (portsmouth, uk) this evening. comes in at ?44.99, which, is pretty steep, but, you get quite a bit for your money. front of the box : back of the box : back of the box closeup : contents : it was a nice surprise to get numbered bags ... not had a large set with numbered bags for quite a while, at least in none of the sets i've bought recently! didn't take a close up of the stickers, but i was quite disappointed that the curved pieces had stickers ... if they could print the att curved pieces, why not these? minifigs : oh ... and there's a nice backprint on the pilot figure : now, the build was pretty good ... you build the plane first (after the minifigures). quite an interesting build in a way, becayse for a while you think the back is the front ... and then you realise, heh! now ... i've not seen the film in a while, but i don't recall a guy flying a plane with a fishing rod ... don't flame me if this is what happens, see earlier point regards not seeing the film in ages!! :-p after that, you build the temple in stages, starting with the entrance first, and then the holey floor section with the spears. these spears are just loosely placed into technic holed bricks. quite easy to make em flick out but they can go anywhere! hehe entrance : holey floor & spears : these two parts are hinged and on an angle to each other and the gap makes for a handy bottomless pit, complete with pole for indy to swing over with his whip. after that, you create the door and the ratchet mechanism to keep it raised. after that, you add the runners for the ball and the swinging knives trap. swords trap - before : after : finally, you build the statue that holds the efigy. nice bit of construction here, especially the way that everything falls over once the efigy is removed. do be careful when putting the curved bits on though ... it appears one of the edges on mine has slightly bent when putting it on ... nowt noticable though. temple : preparing to steal : run!! you can see that the temple has toppled and debris has fallen all around ... and then, as he goes through the door, the door falls (he gets his hat) and then the rock ball starts a rolling! ruuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuun!! the stickers were a pain though ... there's no room for a border around the sticker here! beware!! after all that is done, you join all the pieces together and it makes more a really good playset. plenty of opportunity for recreating scenes here! idol closeup : total set : spares : yet more spare stickers??! (sorry, i've already put the spares in my box of bits!) overall, 8 out of 10 ... lots of play value and a pretty nice build. too many stickers though ... and defo poor arms for the skeletons! edited by imperialshadows, 01 june 2008 - 12:18 pm.

1 awesome!!! i want it soo bad!! :'-) how much was it? edited by indy565, 16 december 2007 - 12:55 am.

1 thanks for the review! this is certainly bigger than i expected! can't wait to see your other pics! *y*

0 is the efigy a totally new peice, or is it made of smaller peices with some gold hair attatched? sorry if i missed this :-$ nice review, just wish we had some more pics of the built set :-d

0 thanks for the pics cant wait to see more, oh btw when the camera charges could you pleese take a photo of everything falling apart when indy takes the idol? cheers! reveiw on *y*

1 great review!this set has lots of play value i see too bad about the hovito though :'-( one request: -could we get some close up pics of the idol? thanks very much

-1 cool. found it bit disappointed though |-/ ... (not disappointed about the review but the set)

1 wow! i took a peak at the pics in your photobucket, thanks very much! this is a wonderful set, full of details! awesome! :-d *y* *y* ~peace

1 awesome looking playset. will probably not get due to price, and the fact i don't really need it. good to see how everything works, but those damn stickers!

1 thanks for that fine review, big pete! *y* a really adventurous set with a good playability and neat traps! that mayaesque sticker?s also very decent. i think that the box art of these indy sets is pretty cool too with all these 'action scene' pics, nicely done, tlc. overall, a very lovely set indeed.... tomb raiding on! :'-)

1 thank you for another excellent review big pete! *y* *y*

0 thanks for the great review! i'll probably be picking this one up if only for the minifigs (how can you not complete your alfred molina minifig collection?) and the idol piece. tinypiesrus, on dec 15 2007, 10:41 pm, said: oh, i watched this scene a few weeks ago, and the pilot is fishing while waiting for indy to escape. this is correct, and in pure serial film fashion, the pilot is has just hooked a big one just as jones starts yelling for him to get ready to leave ;-) badger

0 indy565, on dec 16 2007, 04:05 am, said: yes, but i don't live in the uk. any idea how much it might cost in the us? $59.99 is the us price. already up for pre-sale on amazon.

0 this set is pretty nice i love the idol id probably buy the set just for that :-d lol is it just me or in the earlier concepts of this set we saw a native on the box? i wonder why they removed it :-( *wacko*

0 i just noticed another inconsistency between box art and the actual set ... on the box, the biplan has white wing supports (they're just plane windows without glass in them) and yet the set they are dark grey (or is it bley ... can never tell the difference without careful study). add to that ... the outer of the engine at the front is white on the box and black in the set. we don't normally have this many inconsistencies do we ?

1 because of exams and other obligations, i haven't posted this sooner. seeing that no-one else has reviewed this set, i thought i might as well do it myself. the set in its entire glory (minus the slammer, instructions and the (obviously) massive sticker sheet) the four cars included in this set; a muscle car, a sports car, a roadster and the police off-roader(!): because the police obviously have no clue that an off-roader is useless for catching street-racers, no less a batmobile-ish sports car, it will always trail behind: but the police have a trick up their sleeve - the drawbridge: gotcha! and the mechanism that makes it all tick: the motor is nothing more than a (slow) pull-back motor. push down the bridge, the latch will hook on to the gear and keep it in place until the latch is released. and there's the new gas station. staying within theme, this gas-station is, like the tanker in 8147, from the company fuel 4 speed: there's a notable presence of detail here, such as the soda-dispenser, water (coolant?) bottles and other accesories, two fuel pumps and bumper-level railings to prevent cars from crashing into them. there's no interior however. and as demonstrated here by a loyal octan-employee and a pursuing officer, the gas station is built to minifig-scale: my impressions of this set: as a collector of tiny turbos, and yet to miss a set, i got this one regardless of what it included. the gas station is indeed very nice, and the minifig-scale accesories were unexpected. the lack of interior is no big issue, and the both the station and bridge can with ease be implemented into a mini-fig town. the bridge also solidly built, and includes the ramps in its design, so it can be lifted, with ramps attached, without breaking apart. the slammer included in the set is identical, apart from the white color, with those in 8147. the cars are also very nice, altough i am yet to get used to the yellow batmobile, as i've grown accustomed to calling it. i also love the off-roader's chunky tires, they make perfect wheels for the newer minifig-scale cars. i never consider price/parts ratio, and here it would, for me, be irrelevant, because it will never be demolished for parts. the play value is what i would consider pretty good, and while the bridge won't rise with a car on it, it's still strong enough to stay open with a car tipping over the edge. hmm. every nerve in my body is saying that this sets is worth roughly 8/10, so: verdict: 8/10 edited by whitefang, 23 may 2009 - 07:01 pm. indexed

0 looks like a nice set, i like the tiny turbos and have most of the older individual cars, but i am put off by the ever increasing price of the large sets with lots of extra parts that i'm not really interested in. i wish these were available as individual vehicles as well.

1 thanks for the review! it's really cool that the petrol station is mini-fig scaled, i wasn't expecting that! :-d ~peace

1 it looks like a nice set but i'm not interested in the minis, it's got a nice drawbridge though! thanks! *sweet*

-1 aww man! i hate that face. it doesn't match any of my other lego heads! in my opinion, it's not even lego-ey.

0 thanks for the review. i will probably miss this set as i have too many workers already! :-d zuloon, on dec 25 2007, 09:55 am, said: in my opinion, it's not even lego-ey. i have a few of this head... it's one of the multipurpose heads, it's even been used as a viking! *wacko*

0 thanks for the very thorough review! looks good, but i see they didn't include the new 4x4x1/3 circle piece. ah well, did you see/buy any other impulse sets? ~peace

1 i tink its better if you resize the pics before uploading to ur brickshelf account. picasa2 is a good tool to resize ur pics. use the "export" function. ;-) anyway, nice review! looks like i will be getting all of the city impulse sets except for the fire fighter one. maybe more of those large bin sets. heh.. thanks for the pics! is it possible if you scan the rest of the sets at the back of the manual? thanks in advance! :-d

0 thanks for the review. does anyone know if these mini sets are sold at tru?

1 omg i absolutely love how you reviewed this set, i think you are the only person i've ever seen on eurobrick with such a thorough review. i read eurobricks daily and this really raises the bar in terms of how a person does a review. please do not resize your pics, they are perfect, crisp, large, thorough, and clear; it gives anyone who really wants info on the set just about everything they need to know about it. i had no idea they used that lil "thing" to have the cement mixer spin, cool idea ;-) . nice set, but perfect perfect review. thanks much! x-d

0 thanks for the review, this looks like a nice set to have multiple copies of... i think that you may have mistyped the setnumber, as i was expecting this cute car when i read the title (i wondered how you could see a cementmixer in this set...) :-p

1 heres all the parts in assorted baggies, and the horribly messed up instructions. four astronauts and four aliens, with an extra gold visor (yay!) not bad. the base of the horribly unstable alien craft. the wings move up and down, aswell as back and forth, the purpose i know not. next we build the nerf section of the base. basically technic. and the rest of the tube connectors. heres the farthest i got the little missle to go. its fairly dissapointing. good thing i didnt expect much from this portion of the set. heres the start of the command base. more of the main structure, will be adding lots of things to all the little beams. heres a storage container and the surprisingly not flimsy radar. on this side we see the alien elevator. it uses a horribly long technic rod, i have not seen one of this proportion, its like, a foot and a half long. more of the inner base where all the little tubes shall go. all the connected tubes and such. i also encountered a problem. in the instructions it says for the end of the elevator prong to be touching the tube connector where it is shown here, but mine has a 1x space inbetween. no matter. heres the completed base. + my knee. again. onto the spaceship. the bulk of it is just technic supporting beams, with some large slope peices covering it all up. more on that later. the white coverup. the middle section lifts up to store the overly large jetpack. as you see, the storage containers take up most the bulk in the back, and you can see the jetpack on the ground. aswell as the trigger hand hold thing that allows you to swoosh it. look, in the back! lego greebles! despite the large cockpit, it only holds one person, laying down. the wings are really the saving grace - double layered with a nice two toned effect. kitty nudged me this picture so its abit blurry, my apologies :-| extra peices and or peices i have no idea where the hell they go. :-p overall, the set is quite fun i must admit. full price, i probably would not go for it, but i got it for just under 70 dollars. for that price i can confidently say its quite worth it, many useful peices, nice figures (other than the aliens) and the tube things are quite fun to boot, even though i liked the life on mars system more, which i also have. none the less, its very fun to make them shoot around. alright, so its not much of a command base either, and it looks abit bare. but it's still fun, even if you ignore the nerf section. overall i give it a hardy 3.5 out of 5, the openness and epic fail of a missile launcher are hard to get by, but overall, its a dandy set :-d merry christmas *wub*

-1 thanks for the review brickmaster! i wanted this set at first but i realized i don't want it as much anymore, seems like a waste of 90$. :-(

0 i just want the ship...just the ship.

0 i don't recall mine having an alignment problem on the tubes... could you perhaps take a closer picture of the area? did yours also have two of the same sticker for the wings of the alien craft?

1 thanks for this review. lots of minifigs is a plus, although half of them are junk jellies, but dang the base just doesn't seem impressive. it looks so cheap, like a skeleton. the tubes are just ridiculous. but hey, at least it comes with two cool spacecraft, that's nice.

0 i agree, it does seem very scarce, but ive taken apart the nerf launcher, made a new module with the tube the launcher used, and beefed up the base with some computers and other things. for 90 dollars i would pass, i agree. on sale it is lovely, though. and none the less ive been entertained for ages with them flyin through the tubes :-d

0 thanks for the review brickmaster! this set looks nice, i really like the orange (*wub*) and white colour scheme, although the purple of the lom base was very cool too. i only have the lom base, if you have it built could you show a comparison? on an unrelated note, by the time i realised the red and blue hangers on the lom base were for the red and blue mechs, the mechs were no longer in stores. :'-( i was a bit slow, huh? :-p anywho, this is one set i won't be buying, although if the rocket was sold separately i'd get that. :-d thanks again. *y* ~peace

1 set 7741. the box: back: cool pose on back: the insides: the dss: theres acually a printed piece: the new handcuff piece with sb in the back: the finished product: the inventory: police page: the mail page: is this a new air plane?: the fireman page: the back: a future doctor hair piece?: price: 5/5 play: 5/5 overall: 5/5 i *wub* it!!!!!

0 thanks. iamded you never know.us ;-)

1 thanks for the review pspguy. i think this is a very nice little chopper... but the biggest reason why i will probably get this is for the handcuffs! :-d are the side windows flush like the old ones or recessed like the new ones are supposed to me?

0 the binoculers. :-) you must have a small moniter.

0 pspguy, on dec 26 2007, 12:29 pm, said: you must have a small moniter. that i do my friend, that i do :-d

0 a nice simple helicopter! i always had thoughts of this, but after the review i'm gonna go get it! (well, not at the moment... x-o )

1 pspguy, on dec 27 2007, 03:08 am, said: what? if your asking how they are but together you snap the window piece into the ho\lder. errr.... no. as brikbitz said on his site in the 7732 postal plane review... quote you can see the traditional airplane window piece, but the bad news is they've changed the window pane. it's the new flat piece used in 4996 beach house, it just doesn't work as well. without the original bevelled edge it doesn't seal the window and there is small noticable gap around the edge. not a major problem but it might get a bit draughty inside and certainly no high altitude flying. i was wondering if it is the old or new type. darth_legois_619, on dec 27 2007, 08:20 am, said: nice review *y* i will get 2 of these at the least especialy since they're going to be $15 aud *wub* :'-) how did you find out the price? if you are right then this is a must buy! *wub*

-1 is it wrong that i got an extra printed control panel with this set? edited by db24, 27 january 2008 - 01:36 am.

1 so here it is, the long expected ;-) review of the town plan: i bought it at the legostore riem arcaden last saturday. i paid 149,99 eur for 1981 pieces. this set is separated in 4 parts. 1: the service/gasstation 2: the cars. the petrol pump and the fountain 3: the cinema 4: the town hall the service station has a lot of really nice details, like tools for the car repair, or the table with the cashpoint and the foodstation (there?s a croissant, a banana and a apple in this set). one of my favourit parts is the trolley with some tools, you can see it at brickshelf. at the second part are only a few pieces and i needed not much time to built the 2 cars, the fountain and the petrol pump. there?s something at the truck i don?t understand.. maybe i did something wrong.. but.. the truck has no backlights.. *wacko* i like the petrol pump, that?s why i post a pic of it: the cinema is the highlight for me. it has also really nice details, like the popcorn table or the gumball or candy machine. the colours sheme is really nice, the front of the building with the big displays is a cool idea. overall a really nice building. the town hall has also a really nice colour sheme, i love that dark green mixed with the white stairs. a lot of plants around and in the town hall. as you can see some figs who married there. not more to say about this building. see the pics and enjoy it: overall this set is a must have!! it was really fun to built it. this set reminds me of the back to the future movie with michael j. fox. the whole gallery is at brickshelf, there you can find a few more pics. i hope you enjoyed this review. regards sandra

1 great review sandra, thanks for taking the time. i love the theatre and the town hall, and the married couple is just a cute little extra *wub* this looks fantastic not only for the model, but for parts as well!

1 thank you for the review sandra! this set looks finally nice, better than my first view. i really need it, i've already planed to integrate it to my new layout... it will be hard to wait for it!

1 thank you very much for the wonderful review, legocastlegirl! plenty of pics, thanks again! *wub* *y* ~peace

1 can you take a picture(s) of all the film posters?

1 legocastlegirl, on dec 28 2007, 02:12 pm, said: there?s no necessity to take pics of all the film posters. there are only 3 different film posters at the set. always one poster twice.. and you can see every different poster at the brickshelf gallery. if you need more details, then you should maybe buy it :-) regards sandra ouch ;-)

1 awesome!! i love the intierior of the theater! really good reveiw!

1 i see the service station has a full arry of tools, oxy/fuel torch and other goodies. not a bad set, still very pricey :-/

1 very good review, thanks!!!!!!!! axle, on dec 28 2007, 02:07 pm, said: can you take a picture(s) of all the film posters? sticker sheet pic with 1 megapixel film posters

1 tks sandra for these sweet pics 8-? this set is a true thing of beauty ;-) i love the vehicles and all the sweet details added to render that gklorious 50's atmosphere ;-) i love thge town hall, its very cleverly built and looks great 8-? my favoprite part of the whole bunch has to be the movie theater wich is superb *wub* i guess its pocorn time :-p ps: @ tedbeard - do tone it down youg man !! if you're not happy with sandra's work, do provide one yourself instead of bitching on how you view a review and on how sandra's post is veryt far from one (according to you !!) *yoda*

1 thanks for the review legocastlegirl - excellent work *y*! i agree with you, the best part seems to be the movietheater!! that?s perfect because i just love to watch movies in the theater, so far this year i?ve seen 46 pictures (and had some pop-corn to ;-)). this is a must-get-set!! town on copmike

1 really cool review: i have got so much to do that i even did not know that set is already available. the cinema is great. aredhel

1 sorry for answering so late but i was very busy... thanks guys for your comments *y* tedbeard, on dec 28 2007, 08:08 pm, said: sorry to disagree with anyone however, but this was not a great review. i appreciate the effort sandra made but a great review would include more details such as what are stickers and what are printed pieces. a great review points out flaws or limitations as well as what works or is really neat. a great review would have analyzed the price per piece and compared that to other sets/themes. one might look at the recent reviews of the indy sets or the new spongebob sets as examples of really good reviews. the pictures are good but a great review, above all, should provide the reader with some new information, perhaps even answer questions posed in the pre-release discussion thread. i learned nothing new about the set from this review. that said, it was a good review for someone who had not seen the pre-release discussion and she did a good job of showing said person what they could expect in the set. it?s good that you told me your opinion about my review. it was my third review i made and i have to say that i made this review not for analyses, just only to show the eb members some nice pics and to tell them my opinion. lego is fun for me!! i don?t like to analyse the pieces, bricks, prices, colours. i just want to build something. that?s why i?m at eurobricks and not at an other big legocommunity in germany. lego is fun, fun, fun!! and everybody knows that lego is a expensive hobbie.. so why should i write it again and again? julencin2000, on dec 29 2007, 10:07 pm, said: very good review, thanks!!!!!!!! sticker sheet pic with 1 megapixel film posters thanks for the link julencin! ;-) xwingyoda, on dec 29 2007, 10:25 pm, said: ps: @ tedbeard - do tone it down youg man !! if you're not happy with sandra's work, do provide one yourself instead of bitching on how you view a review and on how sandra's post is veryt far from one (according to you !!) *yoda* thanks *yoda* *sweet* copmike, on dec 30 2007, 01:30 pm, said: thanks for the review legocastlegirl - excellent work *y*! i agree with you, the best part seems to be the movietheater!! that?s perfect because i just love to watch movies in the theater, so far this year i?ve seen 46 pictures (and had some pop-corn to ;-)). this is a must-get-set!! town on copmike thanks copmike :-$ so it will be a good year 2008 for you. there?ll be a lot of good movies at cinema next year. i can?t wait for national treasure: book of secrets, the second movie after national treasure with nicolas cage.

1 oh... i want this sooooooo bad!!!

1 kimt, on jan 4 2008, 10:25 am, said: btw: which set would you recommend: market streeet, town plan or cafe corner? just curious. they're pretty expensive and i might only afford one of them. i guess it all depends on what you are after kim. if you want a really great and detailed set i would opt for the cafe corner, but if you want a set that can easilly be included in a city i would opt for town plan. since i can't afford all of them, i will just get town plan, because i lve the feeling of thge set and that theater is superb !! *yoda*

1 this is a great set, lots of detail and that service station and gaspumps do it for me! *sweet* thanks for the review legocastlegirl! *y*

1 happy new year, everyone! i went to my local wal-mart looking for an exclusive bionicle set yesterday, but was amazed to find everything there- sw, bionicle, ef, indie, the works. i nabbed the jsf and the rogue shadow and scampered home to take pics with my new camera. *wub* the box: the same as the other '07 boxes. nothing new. the back shows the various features, with "pop out r2." :-| luckily, the intruction booklet and the dss were intact- not folded like the last mm set i got. |-/ the dss: not too bad, but printed parts would have been great. the figs. anakin is amazing, imo. *wub* fits the cw anie great. i noticed on the s@h reviews the kiddies were saying how ugly he looked. |-/ they need to see the cw cartoon. for the sake of my health, i should probably stop reading those. :-d the build. i won't go too in-depth on the build, since *vader* posted a very in-depth review here. the start of the build: the body of the fighter starts out long and skinny. the jsf's landing gear allows it to sit comfortably without getting in the way while swooshing. r2-d2's launching device. r2 in position. when launched... ...he often gets stuck if you don't press the button hard enough. :-/ looks like r2 needs to lay off... whatever it is robots eat. so far: the flag stickered. it's a big sucker sticker. completed. i forgot to add the nose stickers before i took the pic. warning- the nose cone sticker is actually two stickers. i thought it was one, peeled of one of the stickers, and put it on the middle of the two 1x8 plates, and didn't notice the other sticker. *wacko* various completed shots: i think this was a beautiful little set. r2's launching unit and the flick missiles are annoying, but easily fixed. i plan to add proper cannons in place of the flick missiles. anakin is a great minifig, but he doesn't look so well standing next to my other figs. the brickshelf gallery (when public) will

1 great review!! i still don't like that cartoon anakin though :-/ excuse me for a sec *runs to local wal-mart to check" :-d buying 08 sets on! p

1 thanks for the review agentrick57. it is a beautiful set, and quite cheap for me; $50 aud for 965 parts! 8-? not sure what i will do with the rabbit though; it is huge! :-d (i was considering doing this review myself but sinnerton is a mess... :-/ )

0 blah. i wanted one of these at half off but i forgot and missed out. thanks for the review though :-$

1 got one for 90 usd, one of the best trains ever..funny as train, perfect for parts. what else to say. *y*

1 okie guys and gals, here s time for some droid exploration with my review of set 7670. as a general statement i have to say its really a neat set that is not that expensive for what it holds. 1) box art like always i will start with pics of the box art. btw, notice anything guys ? no bloody crappy dss. yes, finally a set without stickers and that feels great :-d 2) the mfs nothing really spectacular there. the only novelty lies within the inclusion of the new commander (yellow torso) bd. apart from that, there are 2 bds and unfortunately yet another sbd (i like those but i have a huge amount of them, and i would rather had something different). you have 3 short blasters and a couple of extra parts. 3) the spider droid i think it?s a pretty cool little buggar. it?s a rather simple yet classic construction i think. it has sweet parts such as the bd body in dark bley. it really has a spider feel unlike the previous ep3 one. 4) the hailfire droid this baby represents the ?pi?ce de resistance? of this set. i truly love it !! sure it?s a bit under scale but i don?t really mind that. its conception is superb even if i totally dislike assembling those technic treads (especially 80 of those small things). the ellipse of the treads is well balanced and that trans disc is a brilliant idea. the great thing is those new flick fire missiles: they don?t fall unlike the other ones and they do look good on this baby. also you can put the wheels together and the missiles to gain some shelf space (easy storage on :-d ) in conclusion those druids re really sweet and are perfect target practice for the upcoming rgs hehe !! i hope you enjoyed that review and do not hesitate to comment and ask pic requests if any ;-) *yoda*

0 they released the battle droid commander in 2000 :-|

0 trudop561, on jan 5 2008, 04:21 pm, said: they released the battle droid commander in 2000 :-| while there was a yellow-marked battle droid officer in the 3343 minifigure pack released in 2000, the battle droid commander from 7670 is different. the new 7670 commander has a torso made of all yellow plastic, whereas the 2000 battle droid commander had a tan torso with yellow printings, and a tan head with yellow printings. so, while we have had a bd commander before, the 7670 commander is "new."

0 you thought the bat tank was bad, the tie crawler has 81 for each of the sides *sing*. and don't get me started on the sand crawler! :-x

0 nice review! and you finally got an 08 set! i haven't gotten any, i blame wal-mart for putting products out late |-/ :-d instead of a sbd, tlc should have included a droideka(new version) *y* the scale is a bit off, so this is a dwarf hailfire droid :-p p

0 nive review of it yoda.. but i was going to do a review of it.. but now i see this.. i don't want to do it anymore.. :'-( next time.. try to do it with action.. [it is rare that people do that, they only do it with the set and not further..] ;-)

0 great review very precise. as for the spider droid construction, i have already worked it into a moc: http://www.brickshel...ry.cgi?f=290980 stryker-single gun hydra-seven guns hammer-missile pods. steel...

1 thanks for the great reveiw *yoda* fantastic pictures (very crisp) i am now going onto bricklink to purchse to because you have reasured me that this is a good set. ashoka~

1 great review, as we've come to expect from *yoda* *y* nice to see that tlg is finding new and interesting ways to get around the "no minifig only" sets restrictions with hasbro. clearly, this is another army builder with a minimal vehicle as we're becoming accustomed to. heck, even the diminutive hailfire is technically a droid as well, thus making this all minifigs, from a certain point of view. only negative: it is a bit overpriced. i'll have a better feel for that when i get one. treads/links always drive up a price, so it might just be fair. the spiderdroid is a winner, even with the unusual parts assortment. i like it when lego thinks of different ways to use things, i think it promotes the same from us. i'm not sure what i think of the new battledroid commanders, but at least i can make extras easily if i need to, as i bought a bunch of yellow droid bodies off bricklink once, thinking i might want to make some kind of new droid out of them. they were cheap at the time, now i expect the price to go up just because of this potential use. between those and the grey ones, it's good to see more becoming available. hopefully we'll see black and a few other colours produced for some nice customizing possibilities. all in all, a nice little set with a great army building potential, especially on a buy-one-get-one-half-off or better type of sale. until then, i'll grab one or two and be glad to have them.

1 i got this set for a few months [1 or 2].. and i agree that it is small.. but still.. it looks great on plates, clone troopers [just for fun..] >:-)

-1 i got this and a couple of other sets on monday.and to tell you the truth, i was a bit dissapointed.i like the set, i like the parts, but it's definitly not worth it's rrp of $45 nzd, if you ask me i should be more like $35 nzd, but hey, i still like it, i got it for $30 on ebay so i'm not complaining *y* *y*

1 ah i finally got the 2 city sets i really wanted !! i am so happy that lego went postal on us :-p . since they are rather small i shall do a mix review of these 2 sweet sweet sets. 1) mail van (7731) like always i?ll start with shots of the box art and bloody dss. now here are the extras of that set: i really love the new torso of the postal worker. my huge grip lies on the mail box: that mail logo is a freaking sticker !! for that part i was so expecting a printed part. that is really really bad !! apart from that the design is pretty cool. the van is quite simple but i think its pretty cute. i love the fact that the rear is a window. 2) air mail (7732) like always i?ll start with shots of the box art and bloody dss. the extras are ok: another great postal worker. you also have yet another red trolley with a package that is a bloody sticker yet again !! g tlc should have more printed parts !! that plane for me is a classic thing of beauty !! really is consistent with the fantastic planes of the 80?s. that?s the kind of lanes tlc should produce instead of those huge playmo planes. actually i am happy that tlc released that one ? for once its not a bloody airline exclusive promo set !! here are general pics. i love the engines of the plane: simple yet superb. also the top hatch opens to insert mail and packages. the front control panel is a printed part !! i love the classic double train windows and here is a poc of the undeneath of the set. in conclusion i truly love these small sets: they are the perfect size (4 wide car yeay !!) and the colour pattern is amazing as well. i hope you enjoyed that review and do not hesitate to comment and ask pic requests if any ;-) *yoda*

1 excellent review. you convinced me to buy these two. could you tell me how much you payed for them? i think i'm gonna buy them tomorrow if they have it already (or if i don't see any cooler sets).

1 thanks for the great review *yoda* . i'm definitely going to get that plane, i've sadly only owned one of the many lego planes there is. :'-( thebrickster, on jan 5 2008, 11:23 am, said: i haven't spotted these in the us yet. i'm looking forward to finding them. overall, the 2008 line-up is a excellent and it's going to be difficult for me to decide which themes/sets to pursue. there's a lot to choose from. really? where do you live?

1 nice review yoda i dont think i have ever read one with as much cursing of stickers! :-d i love these two little sets, the colour scheme the little different wheels on the post van and of course the new postmen uniforms! would have been nice if they had included little satchels like in the new indiana jones sets, oh well! ;-) postman yoda on! *yoda*

1 very nice, cheers yoda! i'll definitely be getting the post van, not sure about the plane though. both are awesome, but i think i have enough planes... can you tell me though, the wheels on the van, are they rubber or plastic? they look a bit tacky...

1 these little sets are really nice! they cought my eye the minute i saw them! it would have been so great if there was a post office to go with them! there are so few buildings in lego city the design is very classic and i am ofcourse considering to get them but it seems that i have a lot of small cars and planes on my desk! :-$ recently i took a flight with cyprus airways from thessaloniki to cyprus and the two promo plane sets were there! i was so tired though that i couldnt stay awake to buy them! im taking a flight again on tuesday and i hope they are not out of stock!! thanks for a great review yoda! a fine job as always! cant wait for your next one

0 thanks for the review! i was always going to get these two sets, so you haven't swayed me at all!! x-d i reckon lego could enhance this sub-theme by releasing a post motorbike (with or without a sidecar) and post office. obviouly the office would be the hub of all the activity, while the post bike would take care of the postal run. this would free up the van to take or recieve bulk mail or parcels to or from the airport. it could then also do the parcel deliveries around the city. the office would also serve as the reciever for all the parcels the new goods truck might deliver. just some thoughts, that's all!! *sweet*

1 thanks for the review :-) i was actually considering getting these, but i saw they were overpriced for my tastes - too bad, theyre nifty lil things *wub*

1 loool : spielberg goes on a career change :-d these are some nice sets. i really love that car. looks sleek

1 thanks for a nice review and few comments to sets: nice airplane, finally some reminiscence for lego city golden era (for me years 1982-1992). everything is nice, but two things are freezing a smile on my face. first of all the ugly new hinge used for plane roof. i have already 4032 and those new hinges are looking really terrible when compared f.e. with 6368. second one is new minifig, i don?t know what i expected, but this torso design looks too simple and too cheap.. concerning new car - i appreciate fact, that tlc makes after long long years again postal sets, but i don?t like those new-style cars. matchbox wheels and bad rate between drivers cockpit and cargo space are damping me from buying. 6651 mail truck or 105 canada post truck were much better... edited by kanal-k1, 06 january 2008 - 07:33 pm.

1 5150 lego, on jan 7 2008, 06:08 am, said: and the plane.... hm. this has a "cute" factor and all, but i mean com'on... you have to open a hatch on the roof to get your packages in?? and what about getting them out? you have to flip the plane upside down? :-| weak. they should have had a hinged rear end or a hatch on the side. yes, this is the lego charming! no stairs in buildings, cars with just one minifig, all those things that make lego what it is... thanks yoda for your review! those posts sets will be mine, but i will wait to find them in my supermarket, even if i have to wait 2 or 3 months, i know that i will save some money, so i will buy more lego :-d there are simple designed sets, but we don't need more: two nice litle sets that are not oversized and too expensive.

0 i'm glad to see the mail van has the doors that used to be on the older cargo containers. i had given up on those older ones, but now that they're still out there, i may invest in the older cargo system instead of the new 6-wide ones. both sets are good enough, i'll get both. i'm hoping for a postal building too, even though i have the smaller of the old post offices. a nice big modern one would be great. i'm not too hung up about the design of the plane; i've got the neat old cargo plane with the tail that swings open (one of the best plane sets) for big packages. the truck is goofy looking, but if i get sick of looking at it i can rebuild it into a classic looking one. great review by the way, the pictures are some of the better one i've seen in a review recently.

0 thanks *yoda* for the great reviews. i love the airplane, it's really cute. the van needed to grow on me though but you did the trick. i don't like the wheels of the van. they will need replacing. and wouldn't everything have been better if they were completely red? dr. brick

1 thanks for the great reviews, *yoda*! the car looks great. *y* and the plane is very cool too, and much more suited to a lego town than the large planes. on!(?) x-d ~peace

1 cool! finally its an entire line i can actually afford to own every set! :-d i can't wait to get my hands on them! if its possible, could you give us the demensions of the box? it would be apprectiated. *y* dp8

1 nice set and review. what i really like is that this set gives you a lot of ideas for your own houses (mocs)? kimt

1 thanks for that really nice review dunamis! now it is even more harder for me to wait for this set. i hope my legostore will get it tomorrow!! it is really nice. i?m a really big fan of the creator houses.. but that one is now the best one for me!!! i love the colour of it and of course the windows at the roof. *wub* creator house on!!! greetings sandra

1 love this set now more than ever. *wub* i knew i wanted it from the first leaked boxshots, especially with my love of yellow buildings (just ask hinckley ;-) ). great review, especially nice to see the closeup parts shots. those new 2x2 white windows are very much like replacements for the classic 2x2 windows tlg stopped regularly making a while back, so it's great to see them. the wheels are trolley wheels, common in sets including stretchers and handcarts. the holder for them is a fairly recent part i think. i remember a couple coming in a little single minifig jet engine repair set i picked up in a s@h order within the last year. oh honey, be sure to wrench that chicken before it burns! *wacko* thanks for another excellent review of a set i'm even more excited about than before! *y*

1 thanks for the review! i definitely plan on getting this one. thanks again! *sweet*

1 thank you for the nice review with many pictures. *y* :-d i already wanted this set, but the pictures make it i want even much/more.

0 agentrick57, on jan 7 2008, 09:49 pm, said: i didn't know that the other models in this set came with interiors. this changes everything! keep in mind there is not a lot of interior, just mainly what was shown in the last two photos of the review. still, it does make the models really nice.

1 great review, thank you. i have this on order for my youngest's birthday next month as our first venture into creator. looking towards the town house thereafter, and then perhaps town plan or the town house.

1 another great review from dunamis thanks! i will get it if i can find it on sale!!

1 thanks for the review. *sweet* this set is on my when-i-see-it-i-buy list! x-d

1 thank you for the great review. i think, i?ll get 2 of these sets, so i can have the beach house and the caf? in my city. *sweet* dunamis, on jan 7 2008, 10:35 am, said: i did see a few pieces that i was not familiar with so i?m going to show them below. keep in mind i?m not a parts jockey so bear with me if i think a part is brand new for 2008 and it was actually released with the classic space line. ... i know these are common, but didn?t they have four studs on top? these only have two: how about this sloped 4x3 window that opens: as for the fence: i know only the 2-stud version. 8-| and the window was used a lot in the 80s and 90s (even in the 2004 city airport). don?t worry, i?m not complaining. it just came to my mind, because today i rebuild my 7866 (from 1983), which had 2 of these babys. >:-)

1 thanks for this great review! i love this awesome set, the creator line never disappoints. this is definitely a must-buy for me, just like the other creator houses. batbrick something! *wacko*

1 thanks for the great review! very in depth! *y* *y* those wheel pieces are quite old by the way, i have 1 from some time ago. ~peace

0 i got this set on tuesday on the sunshine coast (i was on a holiday) and since kmart were having a 15% off lego it was only $40 *y* . im modifying my summer house (its pretty small) .so far i've put a small kitchen,toilet,fridge & freezer downstairs and up stairs i will try to fit a bed and computer also im going to attach a small garage for my minifigs car. 8-?

1 my sister bought this last week. i'm so proud! :'-) this is a great set. not too big, and it looks really nice... will

0 i finally got around to finding this at my local tru. probably going to do an interior soon.

0 hey, yesterday i got around to mod my beachhouse too! i bought two boxes so i could have enough material for an extra floor and then i also added a kitchen, a vine in the backyard, storage for the upper floor... try to spot the humongous flatscreen tv! http://www.brickshel...96/cimg2656.jpg edited by takuto20, 23 march 2008 - 02:17 pm.

1 i had this set, and it's really a very nice and excellent house! thanks for the great review! hehe, enjoy it very much. my fave part was the bbq pit :-$

1 very nice! i have been debating on whether or not to buy it-it would appear you made up my mind for me! *y*

1 looks like i'll need to buy another one i just started the garage (which is attached to the house) but i ran out of yellow bricks........... :'-( >:-( btw nice moc takuto20 *y* i might have to "steal" your idea and make a third story since its abit tight downstairs to fit everything.......ooo yea and i like your kitchen and the dishwasher :'-) ....... edited by darth_legois_619, 23 march 2008 - 11:00 pm.

1 thanks for the review dunamis, this is a great little set! i'm also very impressed with takuto20's mods. i've been trying a few of my own. i liked the tower block design, but a lot of stuff needed fixing. firstly i added a 4th wall, and made it so the storeys could be lifted off like in the other models. i also added flowers on the windowsills and doorways out on to the balconies. still to be added is an extra door for the top floor which i'm going to get from the new doors and windows pack. i added a chimney that goes all the way up the back of the house, and has a fireplace on every level. each floor is fully furnished with a fireplace, wash basin and bed on the upper levels... ...and a corner sofa and coffee table, plus an extra large fireplace on the ground floor. finally here is my idea of what to do with two copies of this set! all the parts pictured are from 2x 4996, except 5 extra fence panels and the minifigs. the house on the left has it's garden at the rear.

-1 1. before buying even if i am city fan, those new sized planes are really not mine cup of tea, my love to lego is firmly frozen somewhere between years 1980-1995. main reason to buy was, that i wanted to write a review at czech afol web kostky.org. i bought it three days ago via web advertising, price was +- 35 usd. 2. after opening the box as presumed, some very big parts and three bags, and as an additional bonus lot of danish air free of charge. first sight told me, that this will be really short and easy building.. 3. impressions during building ...and it was really true. 30 minutes of lazy building. bag 1 - plane. bag 2 - plane gondols with supports. bag 3 - wings and propellers. when i saw the way, how is this plane made, i was strongly thinking to play money for nothing from dire straits as a music accordant with whole set. 4. impressions after building - lookout juniorized creeps. this is my first plane in this scale and for 99% the last one. lack of details, lot of ugly big parts, from whole set you can see the main development target - to keep rrp at some certain low level. inner space of airplane absolutely undone, no details, no luggage, no computers, nothing at all!! just a lot, lot of air! the very only details in whole plane are the stickered pilots desk and some kind of seat constuction. 5. impressions after building - playability but, what is playability at this set? hydroplane, which cannot float (as seen on enclosed photos) ? if tlc will make some new kind of big parts used for gondolas, to make the plane floating, they will for sure make no other damage. juniorization couldn?t be higher. you even cannot drive across the carpet with the plane. so, how to play? open the doors, open the cabin part, and turn with propellers? weak, weak, weak! 6. resumed impressions sadly i must say, that at limited release sets tlc? boat seems to sailing to the worst part of the coast. after quite good 7344, perfect 7899 and 7900, strange, but acceptable 7998, juniorization came back with 7906, followed with this ugly playmobilized 7732. 7. final word in fact, even 15 usd seems to be too much for this kind of set. 35 usd, expected rrp in our country, is really overpriced to hell. neither set, nor minifig is not interesting. tlc maybe knows about juniorization as well, as nowhere on the box the number of pieces isn?t written. if you my afol friends want to spent your bucks, better give half of the price to african orphans. you will save your money, and you will have a good feeling! all the photos you can see below, as i cannot upload onto this topic due to some limit.. http://www.kostky.or...c=15954.new#new edited by kanal-k1, 16 january 2008 - 10:32 pm.

-1 ah great review kanal-k1 (and welcome to eb! :-d ), i was waiting for one of this set. not that i was expecting anything good, i won't buy it. i agree with thr playability, it does seem weak. what can you do with it. swoosh it? :-/ big step backwards lego... :-( dr. brick

-1 i think this is one to leave on the shelf with the giant dump truck of 2006 and the hovercraft of 2007!

-1 howly cow! this is *y* *y* *y* for you for making a review so fast! thank you so much. hope it keeps a lot of people from buying. :-| kanal-k1, on jan 16 2008, 09:26 pm, said: when i saw the way, how is this plane made, i was strongly thinking to play money for nothing from dire straits as a music accordant with whole set. :-d lol! :-d , great comment! kanal-k1, on jan 16 2008, 09:26 pm, said: this is my first plane in this scale and for 99% the last one. this will never be my first or last plane and that for 100% :-x 7723 crap plane off!

-1 review gets *y* *y* , ugly plane gets :-x. thanks for the review!

-1 thanks for the review, but its an utter pass for me on this one - i already have a huge juniorized plane from the airport set - one is enough for me! :-$

0 am i the only that one that thinks it is not so bad???????????????????????what i am trying to say is wouldn't planes be this big in real life???i know it has a lot of big pieces but how would they make them any smaller,or how would they the big pieces into a bunch of tiny pieces?well any way i do think in some cases that if there is any "juniorized" involved it should be with duplo. complaning off

-1 thanks for the review, unfortunately the pictures did not load for me! i have to say having seen other images, i do agree with your comments, the plane is far to big, and not enough details. that sums it up for me!

-1 daoudbazaar, on jan 17 2008, 05:21 pm, said: thks for this caustic review :-d i'll wait for the parts on bricklink. i think you're a bit unfair with this small oversized submarine - oups sorry, i mean plane. here are some advantages i tried to imagine : 1. that's the first submarine with a plane nose, 2. that's the first unprinted nose, 3. that's the first shark that make me laugh, and which has a plain white fin 4. and at last, you should have notice that that the first submarine with a wing made of several plates it is said that this set has more than 200 parts... hide and seek ! x-d you may have lost several bags i'm eager that people buy this set a lot : i'd like to buy a lot of these new white 4x4x2 curved slope for my mocs. can you take a picture of the plane crashing in the sink ? is it fire proof ? i think that will be too easy this year to decide what is the crap of year ... great comments, rofl, rofl, rofl. :-d :-d :-d concerning last sentence - i have seen or built hundreds of different sets issued since 1980 until now, but this plane is really a hot candidate not only for crap of the year, but for crap of the decade... last two days i thought about the sense of this set, and, finally, i was enlighted - i must call to my folks living in a small village, i am pretty sure, that they will be happy for a new house for their pullets. edited by kanal-k1, 17 january 2008 - 06:31 pm.

-1 i'll probably get the nice green cargo plane. but not this. how can the same hull pieces be used for full size jets and what's supposed to be a small seaplane.

0 what i don't understand is what sort of crime this seaplane is exactly designed to fight that the multitude of other crimefighters in lego city can't handle.

-1 legoman132, on sep 11 2008, 07:26 pm, said: this still looks like a cool set but the price not so much. do all lego police set come with the polizei option or just ones from europe i have not bought a police set in years. legoman, why are you kicking a topic from the beginning of this year with such an irrelevant reply after all?!

1 an excellent first time (?) review iamded! *y* well, atleast a first time redman review anyway. i really enjoy redman, i hope to see him pop up more often. your pics are great now that you ditched the phone :-p , and you've shown the set from many different angles and perspectives. thanks for this brilliant review, you have certainly convinced me to get a few of these, and then some x-d redman on! edit: btw, is it just me, or does my new avatar make me seem a bit creepy? 8-| batbrick is back! >:-) edited by batbrick, 18 january 2008 - 12:39 pm.

1 great review iamded! lots of pics, all the details. wish i could find some of these sets locally, but so far no luck. :'-( i fully intend to steal your use of a character to do the reviewing, should i ever do one like this. x-d oh, and if eb news presents ever needs someone to do a commercial, we'll be sure to get in touch with you. *y* batbrick, on jan 18 2008, 07:36 am, said: btw, is it just me, or does my new avatar make me seem a bit creepy? 8-| are you sure it's the avatar doing it? 8-| :-d ;-)

0 very good reviews, i think that redman is really ok, a very little cute curious fig... sadly he is not in the impulse set... ;-) i wish to see redman still around about your creepy avatar, yes, it look a bit creepy *skull* nausicaakro (this impulse set is storage in 8 copies, with 8 wizard set, 16 city set (2x), 16 mission to mars set... so if you want buy 10 of this (like me) you must find 2 different toy center)

1 nice review, very detailed. *y* as for the spare parts, mine didn't come with any. both dark grey 1x1 round plates are used on the weapons rack (one for the armour, one for the helmet) and i only got one robot hand for holding weapons.

1 thanks everyone for your positive feedback, it's really appreciated! :-d you'd be surprised how long that 'redman presents' thing up the top took me to make! x-d so, it appears people do like redman, expect him to be reviewing the good wizard and battle arachnoid in near future!

1 thanks, agentrick! actually redman's based on the wrestling costume version of spider-man, as seen in this set. *sweet* ~peace

-1 i would have purchased a few of these except for the fact that i do not like the new torso that they use.

1 well today i finally got my hands on set 7038, now since the moment i first saw pics of this set i knew it was for me. so lets start with the new troll helmet and torso, these are both great. this troll really stands out as a leader when next to the usual trolls in the dwarf mining set: ok so here's a few shots of the front of the set: now one thing i really like about this set is the way that lego have placed the back wheels higher than the front. this allows the set to really appear to being pulled: here we have a shot at the missiles on the wagon, these are better than some around i have to say. if you look just behind the bottom missile you will see a simple firing device, simply push it down and then let it go to see those missiles fire: the troll flag is moved behind the missiles for firing: one thing that does bother me about this set is the lack of anything on the rear, ok it's easy to fix with a little moc'ing so it's not the end of the world but i would of liked something placed there: now lets move on to the crownie's wagon, this is simple yet good for holding weapons: as for the crown knights themselves, well there the ones from the impulse sets which is great imo: here's a few quick shots of the 2 larger trolls we have so far, i prefer the sand green one. what about you? well that's the end for now, requests for pics and comments are welcome. overall i rate this set as a must for anyone who's a fantasy castle fan, i know i'll be getting more of this set...... as for the new wagon well it's joined up with the other trolls: i do hope the impules crownies i bought today can handle them, oh and yes i did change the knights heads x-d : fantasy war on!! *vader*

1 awesome review!! i like the turkey leg hanging in front of the troll x-d yea the back looks a little....empty 8-| well overall i enjoyed the review! see ya soon!

1 looks like an ace set :-$ i may get this just for the sand green troll, even if i'm not a great castle fan, i do want one of them things! *wub* i also love the goblin's new metal flaked helmet, and the same style with the wheels. they look very nice. the chicken leg fishing pole is always fun too :-$

1 nice review. *sweet* this is a must buy for me since i *wub* the new sand green giant troll! now i just have to wait until it's available in the us :'-( general tarful

1 thanks for this excellent review vader! it seems you are succumbing to the castle side of the force. i love the new helmet, and the new orc torso is fantastic as well, which is great to see that the troll faction has many ranks too. the troll himself i love, i agree with you in saying i prefer the sand green version. the battle wagon is cool, one of the better wagon designs, and the flag is a great touch which improves it. sadly the back is rather empty, but a few mods'll change that :-) and of course this set includes the infamous chicken pole! one pic request, if you have time vader, could you please post a few pics of the new helmet on its own, and on a human soldier please? batbrick is back! >:-)

1 thanks for the review *vader*! the first picture of the troll is great, the gold armour really shines! x-d a fantastic set, i'll definitely get a couple of these! *wub* as for the ogres/'giant trolls', the dark tan one fits in the mine setting well, but for above ground, settings, i prefer the sand green one. *y* ~peace edited by iamded, 19 january 2008 - 10:21 am.

1 some people say they like the shadow knight helmet better, but this one is way better!

0 batbrick, on jan 19 2008, 01:39 am, said: thanks for that vader, i love this helmet *wub* it will certainly work great as an asian dynasty war helm i reckon. thanks again. batbrick is back! >:-) yeah it's alot better than the other one, i'll have to buy some extra ones now just to replace the old ones |-/ still let's hope the new impulse set has the new version *y*

1 this is fantastic, i love the new helmets for the goblins *sweet* i've always loved the chicken leg thing, really screams lego to me! at least how lego used to be :'-( great little bit the goblins are awesome too, and the sand green one should look good next to the tan ones...gives a nice feeling of a real species. in reality not all members of a species are identical, it's great seeing them in different colors. great review x-d

1 those extra helmet pictures just seal how much i love those new helmets *wub* they look so great.

-1 great review, vader :-) as i've said before, this is a nice set, but doesn't really come with anything that doesn't come with the other sets of the line. for this reason, it will be somewhere at the bottom of my list for 2008. also, i like torso and helmet of the dwarf mining orcs much better. the colours make the torso look rather dull and boring, while the other, more brown one, looks much clearer and more exciting. i think i like the *knight* helmet better too, looks more covering and threatening than this one, although i'll save my judgement until i have one in my hands. thanks again vader ;-) edit: forgot to mention, hilarious pic in your sig, vader :-d edited by tinypiesrus, 19 january 2008 - 08:28 am.

1 thanks for the review! i love this set! it's a cheap way to get green trolls, and i love the new helmet, it looks great and i think it will be very usefull for other factions as well. *sweet* dnl

-1 a troll driven by a turkey leg, what a wonderful little detail!!! :-d :-d thanks for the review vader. very clever, using a flag to hide that crazy firing device. i find it rather odd they used blue pins for this. black or gray would've been alot more discrete. about the big trolls, i think using different colours is good. i don't think a troll force would be very organized, so different colours would make the effect complete *y* . as for your troops, looks quite fearsome! definitely compared to my pathetic number of soldiers.. :-$ a nice set, but i would rather get the attack on tower though.. no matter about the price difference.

0 vader, on jan 19 2008, 01:32 am, said: am i the only one who thinks this helmet looks a bit like the juggernaut from x-men?

1 vader, on jan 19 2008, 12:45 am, said: here's a few quick shots of the 2 larger trolls we have so far, i prefer the sand green one. nice comparison shot, judging from these pics, i think i have to agree with you that green suits the troll better. especially since the orcs are sand green as well, indicating some relation between the two races (if they are indeed separate races). great review, very detailed and with lots of pictures. i was already interested in this set, but after reading your review i want this set for sure! *y*

1 tks for the review mate ;-) now i have to bloody wait long because lego france has this line available in freaking march >:-( pissed *yoda* on !! :-d i love the "new" goblin :-p that helmet is really cool. why on earth tlc didn't include that one in the dwarf mine ? such another idiotic move |-/ anyone keeping track of tlc's stupidity lately ? that would be interesting !! i clearly want a huge goblin army now hehe !! and i totally agree with you mate, the troll lokks better in sand green. the cart itself is pretty lame imo - just a sordid excuse to include yet another annoying shooting crappy device. but for a 21? set its okie i say ;-) need my bad guys on !! *yoda*

0 thanks for the review of a set i would otherwise probably have passed on. out of curiosity how did you 'know it was for you'? you seem to be building quite a collection. why castle now? was the fantasy element all it took? just curious. thanks again and god bless, nathan

1 the forklift is amazing, and nice design of the opening side doors aswell. thanks for the review, i may actually pick this one up ;-)

0 brickmaster, on jan 19 2008, 12:27 am, said: it's either that or it's a toysrus exclusive set, as my armoured drilling unit box also had special edition on it. special edition mean that it's a store exclusive set. the cargo theme is a tru exclusive, and another example is thr tie crawler is exclusive to target. also, can th doors be opened on either side?

1 thanks for the review! that forklift is wonderful! *wub* i may have to pick this one up convince dragonator to pick this one up! :-d too bad it can only hold 1 crate. :-/ ~peace

0 agentrick57, on jan 18 2008, 09:48 pm, said: can th doors be opened on either side? no, just one side. i'm not sure why the "special edition". it appears to be the same set as lego sah?

0 i'm curious, for those of you who are not into city sets and want this set for the forklift, what would you use it for?

0 ,

-1 thank you very much for your nice review, the brickster! *y* although i really like this set i?m sooo disappointed about the big "on the cabin" brick :-x , that i probably won?t buy it. tlc could easiliy have done so much better with bricks already in use, like these: or or no, that juniorized part is a thorn in my side. >:-( but i have use for those new canisters. *wub*

0 thanks for the review. i think the special edition is just for making people intrested and make them want to buy that set or something.

0 mr tiber, on jan 19 2008, 02:46 pm, said: hmm, that's a thought, but why would they pick this particular set? i would expect they'd do that with a slightly bigger set, like the heavy hauler perhaps. why do you think they'de pick this one? good question. maybe it's merely a gimick to help push the city sets with all the other competing themes. the cement mixer is a special edition as well.

-1 great review! my only grip with this set is you can only fit one pallet in the truck. it should have been the same size as the trailer so you can at least fit 2 pallets. seems like alotof wasted space. if i'm going to transport cargo, i want to use the maximum amount of space aviable!! x-d

1 i got this set last week and just to add a few of my own points cons: - the forklift spring feels a bit flimsy - i don't know how long it will last or how much stress it would take - and the end coil isn't really heavily secured to the lift mechanism. time will tell on that one. - 30 stickers! it's the exo-force of city sets! the truck set does look less plain with them on though. i would reccomend lining them up with the green brick in the second container rather than applying the first lot without a guide or they may end up uneven - it's very hard to put the minifig in the forklift without dismantling (or breaking open) the set slightly - the cargo box attached to the main cabin of the truck doesn't hold very strongly - minifigs are dull - that dark blue torso with pattern is way overused - green stickers are a different green to the bricks themselves pros: - lots of nice pieces including the large white panels and cargo pieces, and i like the green/ white colour scheme - the cargo doors open well and the hingeing mechanism doesn't stand out to the detriment of the rest of the set (as some people have complained about the mail airplane) - studless floor in cargo containers makes it easy to move pallets in and out - fits in better than the heavy hauler to a minifig sized city - new 1x1x4 slope! (at least i hadn't seen it before) overall - nice set with some good pictures, although a bit flimsy, and way too many stickers - the same issues i have with the cargo plane as well (although that had more colour issues).

0 hey, thanks for the review the brickster! i was just wondering if you could possibly upload a picture of the instructions for the forklift, and, if possible, tell me the piece # of the 1x4 slope bricks (to bricklink them). thanks!

1 greetings, and welcome to another redman review! i'm your host, redman, and today i adorn my medieval outfit to tell you about the impulse set simply titled "the knight". no wait, that's the old script. x-d i mean, "the good wizard". *sweet* the other castle impulse set (the first being 'the knight'), this is a wonderful, and in my case unexpected addition to the castle line! i did not expect to get a nice good wizard, but rather another plain white skellie for the impulse, and was pleasantly surprised when i saw the first picture of this set. the impulse sets give you pieces you wouldn't expect to see in such small sets, for example, the knight came with the armour, and this comes with an owl, a gem, and a crystal ball piece. it comes with 11 pieces, including the wand, owl, and gem, and no spares, which doesn't really matter as it doesn't need any. the box sports the set number, age range (which i blissfully ignore x-d), awesome castle logo, and the assembled set, with the usual 1:1 scale picture of a minifig. the back of the box shows pictures of the boxed skeleton tower and king's castle siege sets. note the price is in new zealand dollars, and is really the same prica as any other impulse set. next are the instructions, which are separated into 3 parts, 1 for the minifigure, 1 for the table, and one for the bird stand. very simple, also worth mentioning is the parts numbers are next to their respective parts, for replacement parts etc. on the back we see (on the top half) pictures of skeleton prison carriage, skeleton tower, and king's castle siege, this time not of the boxed sets, but the sets themselves. on the lower half we have 8 pictures, each of the different impulse sets. the wizard's torso is plain sand blue, with no patterns or anything, but it doesn't really matter is his beard's in the way. ;-) the head is that same old 'white fade to grey beard' head, but the white beard covers up most of the grey. my favourite part is the pants, i love that we're getting printed belts and legs again. his belt has 4 gold crosses (as seen in, if you look closely, the new crownie's torso and the crownie archer's torso) and a belt buckle, and the legs have a bottle, a coin, and a small bag. nice little wizard-ey items. the, er, items, no, accessories, no, models? the stuff in the set include a little stand for the owl, and a table utilising the new 4x4 round piece in light bley, with the crystal ball in the middle, encasing the yellow gem held on by a 2x2 circle piece in blue. why blue, i'm not sure. maybe it's because the crystal is yellow, and the crownie's colours are blue and gold, so the blue piece with the yellow crystal symbolise the crownie's colours. or maybe tlc just felt the need to include an odd colour. :-p in conclusion, this is a wonderful set, with some neat accessories, and it doesn't really need to be bought in the masses, after all, you needs an army of owls and wizards? :-| :-p so it works fine as a single set, and adds a more fantasy feel to your crownie army. that's all for today folks! *sweet* [/redman] thanks for reading another of my redman interviews, any suggestions on how to/what to do to improve it is greatly appreciated, as are all comments and criticisms (except those blatant thoughtless criticisms that don't help at all :-p)! ~peace edited by kimt, 10 august 2008 - 01:31 pm.

1 good reveiw, i quite like this set and ill buy it as soon as it actually gets in my country |-/ :-| (600th post) edit: $7!!!!! geez i thought $6 was bad :-x edit: who typed megablocks in my post..i didnt,??? edited by hollisbrick, 20 january 2008 - 05:41 am.

1 yay! another redman review! you are an excellent reviewer iamded redman, your pictures show all the details included in the set and your thoughts bring new light to features and bits i hadn't noticed or thought about before *y* i love this little set, i will get two i reckon, because i want all the wizard bits in a minifig box as well. nice little humorous pic at the end too. one improvement i think could be to include the pics of the back of the box and other side of the instructions anyway. honestly, there isn't much to improve, you are an excellent reviewer :-) redman on! batbrick is back! >:-)

1 nice review, your camera is much better now. i look forward to more of your reviews :-) i just went to toyworld today and got a wizard and 4 knights :-) and on top of that, they were having a 20% off sale *sweet* i might go back and get some more tommorrow. the wizard is pretty good, and comes with some good parts (owl, beard, legs, hat, round table, crystal ball..). it would be nicer if he had a torso with printing on it, but i can understand why they didn't.

1 iamded, on jan 20 2008, 05:29 am, said: his belt has 4 gold crosses (as seen in, if you look closely, the new crownie's torso and the crownie archer's torso) and a belt buckle, and the legs have a bottle, a coin, and a small bag. nice little wizard-ey items. i think the "coin" is actually some kind of amulet or locket. nice review, keep them coming! *sweet*

0 simonwillems, on jan 20 2008, 02:59 pm, said: thanks for the review of this nice little set. for it's price (3 euros here in holland) it contains quite a lot of useful parts. the only thing that could have been better in my opinion is the wand, i always liked this one: i miss those wands! they could've used it, but i think the wood wand kindda adds "realis" to the set, and since many fans don't like their castle theme to be too fantasized, i guess lego decided to use a mold that was still being used for various sets. when i get this set i'm going to put it on the tower in the king's castle, you know, the one that is right above the throne room? ;-) that'll be a great spot, and then i'll finally have all the necessary characters, the king in his throne, the knights on the walls, the wizard on his tower top, and the princess in her tower room that floats in mid air and is connected to the throne room by a 2-stud wide bridge! :-d i love the king;s castle siege set *wub*

1 yay! more redman! probably going to get one of these and turn it into a carnival attraction.

0 not bad. i could see picking up a couple of these guys along with a few of the new knights. i actually prefer the wizard as these impulse items are simply too expensive for army building (imo). later.

1 sweet plane looks much better than in the catalogs *sweet*

0 lt. veers, on feb 4 2008, 11:42 pm, said: i do admit the amount of cargo is rediculously small, but it still looks good. say, how much can the plane hold? thanks for the review! *sweet* that's all the space you get. now, it might be possible to rip out that rear bulkhead at the back of the wing and fill the middle area with tiles so cargo pallets could slide up the fuselage. but that would definitely prevent the undercarriage folding internally if that's what you wanted to do as well. dr. s.

0 thank you very much for a good and informative review, doc sinister. *y* this looks like the best of the bigplanes to me, very nice and smoother than the rest. :'-) although, like you?ve said, what the heck?re they transporting, diamonds and pearls? so much wasted space.... and the landing gear should really fold in. *n*

-1 i loved the pics in the catalogues but was a bit disappointed by the build and end result. my own thoughts: cons: - as noted, the cargo space is really small considering the size of the plane, although i can see this is restricted due to playability - without the barrier in the middle, the cargo would slide all over the place while the plane was being swooshed - the cargo 'lift' (i'm not sure how else to describe it) is very weak and snaps off, although it is a clever design i think it's badly implemented - there is nothing to hold the cargo pallet to the cargo lift truck so it tends to slide off all over the place as soon as the truck moves - colour issues - i had at least 3 shades of green with the larger plane pieces and noticeable variances even with identical cargo hatch pieces. at least one of them also came quite scratched, which was a little disappointing - at $79.95 aud it's $10 more than the passenger plane was with less pieces and figs, and no printed pieces whatsoever! more $ for less, methinks. pros: - lots of nice cargo crate pieces and even the stickers for these are pretty good. - landing gear piece adjusts very well to height differentials so the plane doesn't lose its gear as often as the earlier passenger planes - the hinging mechanism works very well to open the cargo holds - opens very smoothly and is not noticeable - i'd definitely like to see more of this technique - the little vehicles work well chained together and are all good small designs overall: - i really like the large planes since 06 but i don't think they've still quite hit the nail on the head. whereas the earlier planes were a little flimsy, this one is sturdier but has its own issues. the look of the cargo plane is nice, and the new landing piece and cargo hatch pieces are really great, but some design weaknesses and colour issues detract from the overall product. it's a shame as with a bit of tweaking this could have been a must-have set.

-1 thanks for the review that seems to be a nice set but as far i'm concerned, i don't think it's worth eur 49.99. there aren't so many parts though those new curved slope will add some more building possibilities. *y* what lacks : - a 2 x 4 cut out in the lower part of the nose to retract the landing gear. - a 4 x 6 cut out in the lower part of the tail to allow passagers to get off through the back like in a dc-10 - some real plates and tiles instead of these crappy wings. this part is the useless one that tlc ever produced *n*

1 an excellent review dr. sinister! *y* i really like how tlc is using the new crate mold in different sets! the transport car is really neat as well as the lifting thingy plus i love the green color! *wub* p

-1 wow what a screw up from lego! that one is even more out there than the extra obi wan in the rc. x-d

0 that is the one of the oddest mistakes i have ever heard of! :-d even so, you have to admit that it is good news for you; lego will hapily give you the right head if you ask. thanks for the review. i have this set too. *wub*

1 nice review, all the important stuff is there. weird cock-up by tlc to put an ani face on indy... i didn't encounter any mistakes in my four indy sets. great selfmade temple of doom indy fig, piranha! so uhm... has anyone found out yet what the extra hieroglyphic stickers are for?

0 i have noticed that at my local tlc store (orlando) they have this set in a glass case on display...with the cw anakin head on indy. i did not realize this was such i widespread problem.

1 i got mine today! x-d i too got an anakin clone wars head, although i'm not really complaining since i already have an indy head from the motorcycle chase set. it is really odd that they would pack in such a different looking head though. also, for those that think the head has no use, try placing it under one of the braided new brown dwarf beards. it looks pretty nice, i think! *y* on the set, it's wonderful! the hieroglyphic stickers are wonderful, marion (especially her head and hair) is wonderful, and the anubis statues are nice too. there's also lots of nice tan parts, such as 20 round 2x2s, and 8 1x8 bricks. all in all, it's a great set for the price, and i can't wait to get race for the stolen treasure and temple escape now! *sweet*

0 i got this set and there weren't any qualms/misprints/mis packagings. hmmm, must be a small problem.

0 yeah in mine i did not have any problems. well except on one of my dark blue round pieces it was a bit damaged but it still worked fine and i got a replacement from lego.

1 welcome to: my sigfig sgt. joey sh. will lead trough this review of the new city 7743 police surveilance truck. first of all the box: front back the minifigs: 3 police officers and a bad guy now the vehicles: the cute little atv *wub* the main part of the set: the surveilance truck a shot of the interior the trailer back of the trailer the truck back side the little building: front the interior and last but not least: spare parts and not needed stickers that?s it! hope to see you again at the next episode of sgt. joey?s reviews.

0 thanks for the review, stealth hunter. *y* that truck looks better than i expected, and it?s for sure a pretty playable set. nice, but still too much police mayhem to me. i think the new police station?ll satisfy all my safety needs.... :-)

0 great review stealth hunter, a bit blurry in places but overall nice shots of the truck. it is much, much better than i expected, but i still won't get it, i have no need for more police. thanks for the great review! batbrick away! >:-)

0 thanks for the review, that truck is actually better than i first thought! i am still tossing up getting it, as i am getting the police station, and where would it park?! :-p i quite like the little building though, but still... i am so confused *wacko*

1 hello and welcome to another, oh wait, first batbrick and iamded review! today us two sworn enemies will be reviewing the creator cargo chopper, here is the front of the box: and while pushing iamded to his doom, here is the back: haha! ouch! oh dear...here are the parts anyway... here is the instruction of the first model, the cargo chopper. i love creator sets for the different models, they always excite me. just ignore me finishing off my nemesis in the background. something very interesting that i liked in the instructions was this step where you must add those three 2x2 yellow rounded pieces under the chopper. this is for support while you build, which is handy, and later you take it off: and even later use it as the cargo. i found that to be rather innovative and clever, as well as - hey! what are you hitting me for? both instruction booklets have the same back: now heres the chopper itself. i love the design of it, it isn't quite minifig scale but its great all the same. this is my first non-xpod or house creator set, and it sure is fun. here me and iamded go for a dizzy ride. i love the nose of the copter, and the landing gear is fantastic. a shot from the other side. oh dear, it seems we've been a bit sick from that ride, and were vomiting transgreen 1x1s. the cargo itself is nicely made, though i forgot to put on two tiles here :-$ . it fits in real well with the chopper to, and the line is great for giving iamded the wedgie he deserves: this is my first power function set, so i was pretty excited. the motor is intergrated really well into this set, and is activated by pushing that little 3x2 plate with the 1x1 slopes on it forward, until it hits the motor button, that orange knob. another point of interest is the use of bley barrels on each side. i like this as i don't have those pieces in that colour. a shot of the motor. its really simple, all you do is pull the hook out to any length that allows, then press the orange button and it will wind it back up. this makes the chopper pull the cargo up into its bay, and iamded pull me here reluctantly to a whacking: a top view, is that my head? a view of the chopper without the cargo in it. i love the lowered cockpit: the leftover pieces from building: (note: iamded's head does not count as set piece) and a final shot of the set with me and iamded. oh, it appear we're dead, oh dear... hope you enjoyed this review, soon i will post the two alternate models. i loved this chopper, its great to play with and has nice construction. it also has some handy pieces too. the motor function sounds like a gimmick but is well intergrated into this model. well worth the price, so far this is another win for creator i say! so far i recommend this model, but later we'll see if the alt models are up to scratch. also, since this is my first review, comments and criticism welcome on everything. batbrick away! >:-) edited by whitefang, 23 may 2009 - 06:37 pm. indexed

1 thank you very much for a fine review, batbrick. *y* what the.... i never realized these cool grey barrels till now.... that?s pretty interesting. :-) the whole chopper looks very good, with a well fitting power function. it?s for sure a rewardable work to change that baby into a real mf version with accessible cockpit. :'-)

1 great review! keep them coming! i might get this set now. i must have those grey barrels... oh dear... :-d x-d :-p x-d this was a hilaruos review, too. edited by ~vbbn~, 10 february 2008 - 11:21 pm.

-1 i wish i could just get those grey barrels alone, the rest of the set doesnt really intreigue me much :-$ thanks for the review.

1 thanks everyone, heres part 2: the second instruction booklet includes instructions for both alternate models, which is good, i hate having too many manuals: here she is, the plane: its very nice and well proportioned, but where did iamded get that laser? overview, the landing gear is very sturdy and nice, and the wings are surprisingly good: top view, iamded's head fell into the propellers, i was trying to save him, honest! a view of how the motor on this one works, by pushing the orange button you can make the prop spin. it is well integrated like the chopper, though the prop only spins for about 2 1/2 seconds. still, its a nice feature: the tail is also well made, simple, but lovable. oh, and check out that tank! the prop spinning, agh! is that my hand? final view, there seems to be some sort of explosion here 8-| well i think i got iamded more than me atleast. the second model is also great, though not as good as the chopper. the lack of space to fit something into the cockpit brings it down a bit, but it is a very nice model overall. i recommend it, though unlike the chopper it will be hard to mod into minifig scale. so far so good with 4995, here are the leftover pieces from the model: enjoy! batbrick away! >:-)

1 haha your review are so funny and so lego cool

1 lt. veers, on feb 11 2008, 11:55 am, said: great review, batbrick! iamded got what he deserved. x-d x-o :'-( :-p great review, batbrick! this looks like a wonderful set, i love that plane! it doesn't bother me that it's not mini-fig scale, as it looks more for display imo. *wub* looking forward to seeing the final model! *y* ~peace

1 i really like this set... even though i was hoping for a mini-motor! :-d chock full of great parts too. thanks for the review. *sweet*

1 thanks guys, heres the final part: the instructions for the boat begin on page 46: the overall set, its actually much nicer than i thought it would be, the pictures on the box make it look ugly. top view, tommy guns do not actually come with set ;-) side view, the designers have done an excellent job with the hull, considering the lack of many slopes pieces. you can see it is pretty much minifig scale too: here you can see that by pushing in the red technic axle, the "anchor" on the front will be hauled back into the boat: back view, these outboard motors are pretty cool, though i wish they could go own into the water more: overall, though the weakest model, its still a lot of fun, and has a clever way around the lack of a shapely hull. i was impressed with it after the building it, it even has two rounded snotty bottom pieces on the nose of the boat to give the impression it is speeding through the water with the front lifting up. lots of leftover pieces for this one: the pieces: sorry about the poor photograph there, it was getting late :-$ overall the cargo chopper is another great set in the fantastic creator line. loads of fun, great play, and some clever designs, it challenges you to make your own things, and even includes some nifty pieces (bley barrels! *wub* ) i won't give it a rating, but i'll just say i certainly recommend it to fans of the theme and lego fans in general. now, finally, iamded and i teamup in the face of a larger foe. get that lord of pies! batbrick away! >:-)

1 congrats to that nice review.... i like the batcave set, you should also been able to find it at discount....

1 thank you for your wonderful review! ) i was done very well.... ) i suggest that you will find "two-face's escape" set a very interesting one to build.... it also provides great playability and is not very expensive for what you will get. ) good day to you. )

1 thanks for that nice review. i still don't think i will get this set though. the penguin, on feb 18 2008, 05:04 pm, said: thank you for your wonderful review! ) i was done very well.... ) i suggest that you will find "two-face's escape" set a very interesting one to build.... it also provides great playability and is not very expensive for what you will get. ) good day to you. ) yes, two-face escape is definitly a good buy. i suggest you get it.

1 thanks for the review aayla, i love this set and its great to see another person interested in batman. now all you have to do is start watching the movies, then the cartoon series, then the comics, then the......... x-d i really recommend two-face's escape as well, a great set for a great price. and btw, the green dude as you call him is named killer croc, he is a killer with a freakish skin condition. batbrick away! >:-)

1 it is a tie between two face's escape and the batcave... but i would go with the cave... over 1000 pieces, nifty submarine, penguins, alfred, mr freeze, and and and.... it is wonderful...! especially for 38?!! :-) ol' style batman on! (yep, this is a lil' rant on 2008 batman.. :-p )

1 6258 smuggler's shanty overview smuggler's shanty was released in 1992, it consisted of 69 pieces, 3 minifigs (two pirates, one imperial) and it cost $9.25 (usd). the set itself is a small but rather sturdy den for the pirates! review: the minifigs consist of two pirates and one imperial. the minifigs are not all that rare, which is disappointing, i would of liked a rarer fig! but still it is a good cheap source of pirate and imperial figures. here is an overall shot of the set, which includes the three figs, the shanty which is made using palm leaves pieces, and a nice grey shark nibbling at the soldier's oar. a close up of the soldier rowing hard in his boat. i would have preferred to have a normal soldier with shako hat, as i have more officers than normal soldiers now!: and a close up snap of the main structure. note the wine glass, which was a nice touch! funnily enough, only 4 pieces of treasure were included in this set, compared to the usual 8 gold coins in other sets. a view from the back, which also gives a good view of the pieces used to construct the shanty mainly simple black 1 by 1 bricks: the shanty looks good from most angles but their are a few where the roof construction looks rather odd, but that is just a minor nitpick! yet another view from the front,, this time at a slightly different angle. the yellow base plate looks rather nice too, i prefer it over the tan pieces we trend to get nowadays: "attack!!" the stupid drunk pirate in the background does not even notice! overall i think this is a rather good set, despite some shortcomings, such as the lack of treasure and odd roof from some angles. the shark, imperial soldier and useful parts make up for it, and of course the price is cheap on most auction sites, i got mine for a mere ?5 ($10), with the cheapest price on bricklink being $8. rate the set then leave your comments, thoughts and opinions!!!

1 very nice review, lord of pies! thanks for taking the time to put this together, and especially for all the detailed pics. *y* i very much regret that my dark ages occured when they did. basically, i missed out on all the cheap and easy troop building sets, and this one is certainly no exception. the big sets are nice, but these are the ones that always make me wish just a little harder for a return of lego pirates... :'-) i gave it a 4 out of 5, just because i'd buy 4 out of 5 sitting on the shelves today, were it possible.

1 simonwillems, on feb 19 2008, 07:47 pm, said: nice poll as well, but you made sure nobody can give this set a 1 which is very nice (but probably a little mistake :-d ). i gave it the top-rating. *y* so i have, oops! i never was very good at maths. :-p

1 wow. i remember this set from when i was a kid. i got it for my birthday and opened the package first. sadly, i had to go to school so i had to leave it at home and not build it or play with it until i got home. needless to say that was one of the longest days of school ever. good review, great set.

1 i bought one of these new from bricklink a few months ago as part of my pirate splurge i went on. i really enjoyed this set because of the amount of figs in such a small set, though pirates were always pretty good about their fig count. also the neat little hut is nicely done for its purpose. great review, btw!

1 great small set that can help you add to you minifig count. the little boats are always cool, and the den isn't that bad either.

1 a very nice review of a pretty and neat little set, thanks lord of pies, guess its a 3 for me, with strong tendencies to 4....

1 first of all excellent review! 5/5 for me. i have yet to attain one of these sets. it has a nice trio of men including a redcoat, and a nice assortment of weapons. the rest, such as the leaves, is great for mocing. imperialshadows, on feb 19 2008, 08:41 pm, said: i gave it a 4 out of 5, just because i'd buy 4 out of 5 sitting on the shelves today, were it possible. if i saw 5 of these sitting on a shelf i would certainly buy all 5, then i would ask to speak with a manager to see if there is any way i can attain more pirate lego stuff. simonwillems, on feb 19 2008, 08:47 pm, said: nice poll as well, but you made sure nobody can give this set a 1 which is very nice (but probably a little mistake :-d ). i gave it the top-rating. one should not step into the pirates domain and give a mere 1 to any non4+ pirate set. duke

0 woow :d this was my first lego set ever!

1 this set shows the awesomeness of classic pirate sets. i really have to get me some more! xd great review on a great set!

0 i'd give the set a 3 1/2 out of 5. it needed 1 more imperial to get a 4. a bigger basplate would have been nice as it appears to hard to fit all the minifigs on the island. thanks for this great review

1 imo this is a very simple and small set good to add some part to forbidden island. good

0 laurinator- i don't mind an occassional old review coming back to life for discussion, but it seems you've replied to many old reviews that have been stagnant for years. please try to refrain from "bumping" a lot of old topics as it pushes down new content that should really be the focus of discussion now.

1 hi guys. i picked these up the other day, but it's taken me this long to get round to posting the reviews. so, here we go: tub comparison with a minfig (thanks brainbox): the lighting changes a bit throughout the photographs, as it was going dark outside, so i only really had my desk light, and i kept getting in the way. 4837 mini trains now the box i really like. it's no different to those of last year's sets, but the colour here is simply fantastic, and really seems appropriate for the theme. so this is what you get inside. all the pieces are still inside the bag, the optical illusion was accidental :-d . no pieces of particular outstanding interest, but the dark green cheese slopes are rather nice. look out for those later. 1 2 3 this is the main model, and uses all the pieces in the set (bar these two, which according to the inventory are spares, but as with all my other creator sets, i'm cheating and leaving them in). this is far and away the best model of the three, and evokes the iconic version of a steam train. the green looks superb, but i'm not sure whether that's due to the model itself or the actual colour. moving on, we get to the second model: 1 leftovers (yes, i admit, i was using a piece of paper) this isn't actually a bad model. i don't think it's quite as nice as the previous one, but it's not bad. it's different from the first model as well, which is good. too muich of the same can be a bad thing. finally, we come to the third model: leftovers now... i'll be honest. i don't really know what this is. it's not that good a model compared to the other two. that's all i can say, really. and of course, all the pieces fit into the tub. overall: i have to say, i do like this set, despite the weak third model. the strength of the primary and secondary models make up for any weaknesses in the third, and i can imagine the pieces being fully usuable in building other trains. while the basic idea of these tubs isn't quite as good as the x-pods with regards portability and general 'niceness' they aren't bad. and for a fairly cheap price (?3-4) as well. 4838 mini vehicles this is one of those set boxes that you see because of the ridiculously loud colours. sound marketing scheme if you ask me. i've managed it again. there are pieces outside the bag. or are there? now these i like *y* . 1 2 (i don't know what the clip is for, there isn't one on the other side) 3 4 5 this is the main model of the set, and again all the pieces are used bar these three, the spares. it's quite a nice model, although the car's a bit odd. still, i like the ramps, and the colour scheme reminds me just a little of g1 ultra magnus. hmm, i think that boom arm could do with refixing... 1 2 leftovers this is actually quite nice as well. it's that classic breakdown truck, and the boom arm itself is quite nice, with quite a bit of movement. another solid model. 1 leftovers i'm surprised by the amount of detail here actually. not only have tlc included a spare wheel at the back, but also what looks like a trailer hitch, which all adds to the 'realism.' another nice model to round out a nice set. and in the tub. overall: i'm not sure which of the two i like better. when i bought them, and on the way home, i much preferred the train set. but after building this set, i'm not sure. this is another good set from the year when tlc seems to be giving us so many. there are some good pieces in here too, and while there's nothing unique, they're still good. so, thanks for reading, hope it helped someone, and if there are any requests, i'll see what i can do. that's requests for pics, not songs ;-) . edited by whitefang, 23 may 2009 - 06:56 pm. indexed

0 why not? they are all very nice (i have all six of them), especially the helicopter, my least anticipated, but one of the most detailed!! thanks for the review brainbox!!

0 thanks for the review brainbox. *sweet* these look really nifty* i might pick up a couple of these as for the parts, i'm sure they could come in handy for something. and so cheap as well. i still miss x-pods though. :'-( *do the kids still say nifty these days? *wacko*

1 great review, pictures and all! thanks for showing all the mechanisms of the tower, i didn't notice them from either the pics we had or the instructions--it didn't hit me that when you knock down the wall the second floor breaks. that is a genius idea. this looks like a superb set, unfortunately my priority right now is the troll warship. still, if that really is u.s. $80, i might skip it and go for this instead, which is only $20 us. one note, though. i think there might not be a back cage on the second floor of the tower so that the mechanism can work. did you try to see if the second floor ground still falls if you add it a fourth cage wall? also, you could just pretend that the tower is built against a mountainside. it would fit perfectly and add more defense to the knights. great review! :-) vk

0 this set didn't come with the new jail door piece? i'd have guessed it would have, since there is an orc in prison. nice review. i'm looking forward to picking up these sets. steve

1 thank you for these fine reviews, metalandi. *y* there?re really some nice playable features in the tower raid set, and all these great orc torsos, just sweet! and it even looks like that black orc-armor?s a new piece, lovely.... :'-)

1 thanks for the double review, i like the dwarf catapult but the real deal is the tower raid set. i love that siege tower and love that new armour, can't wait to get it. thanks for the review! batbrick away! >:-)

1 the tower raid has the best price per piece ratio in the whole 2008 line. thanks for the review ^_^

1 thanks metalandi! these are 2 great sets, i'm definately looking forward to seeing these in new zealand stores! the collapsing floor/prisoner freeing mechanism on the tower is wonderful, a great touch. some slight modifications, like, some walls, will make this perfect. and the dwarf's mine defender is a sweet little set, with some neat minifigs. thanks for the reviews! *y* ~peace

1 well, i don't think orcs are that sturdy, seeing that they'd have to jump from the second level of the tower, i don't see survival as his chief objective! :-p awesome review! i'm loving these sets more and more! the tower raid is definitely the best and the cheapest set there! >:-) oh, and pirhana, it's not really a 'king', it's more like an officer. remember, the wizard rules these goblins! edited by trooperdavinfelth, 22 february 2008 - 02:49 pm.

1 *sweet* wow!! another excellent review! haha, that tower does reminds me of kk ii of mistland tower =x well, overall, i love these 2 sets very very much *sweet*

0 thank you for the nice review. pity the tower is not designed better, but i still want to buy these 2 sets. if only there were 2 dwarves in the dmdefender.

-1 i got myself today 3 dwarf's mine defender and i have to say that sets does suck big time: the plastic rubber band doesn't do squat, and 3 wheels i really not enough. i only built 2 of those and changed the front of it with 4 wheels and no plastic rubber band and i changed the 2x2 dark bley plate. its still looks good but the crappy rubber band system is really not well thought off. anyhow my orc army is growing >:-) *yoda*

1 thanks for the great review. *y* the siege tower does look great. i'll have to look out for these sets. edited by zouave, 14 march 2008 - 07:24 pm.

0 well you didn't say anything wrong yet undead army officer i perfer using the batle wheel to knock down the tower's walls, not the seige tower

1 the rancor, on apr 22 2008, 05:54 am, said: i perfer using the batle wheel to knock down the tower's walls, not the seige tower i love all the siege machines the orcs have, they are certainly a much bigger threat than the skellies. batbrick away!

0 yeah, the open towers are kinda funny, although they were also typical of (for instance) 90s pirate sets. the trolls' vehicles are cool though. they look evil. i can't wait to start collecting '08 castle sets...(i didn't buy any castle in '07, i only got one set for xmas, so i'm catching up on the '07 stuff first before it's all sold out)

1 now that this topic has been brought up again, i just want to say that the rubber band on my dwarf mine defender actually works

1 they're so beautiful... 4 more months.

1 green grocer reviewed by dunamis set 10185 2,352 pieces $149.95 from the lego store (glendale, ca) build time 6.5 hours holy guacamole! almost exactly one year after caf? corner was released we get the third installment in the increasingly popular lego exclusive town series. combined with the famous 10182 caf? corner and its trusty companion 10190 market street this trio makes the foundation for an amazing city block of lego goodness. for those new to this series of sets, check out my reviews of the two previous sets in this line: cafe corner market street i would not necessarily recommend reading too many of my reviews in one setting as you might experience loss of brain cells and/or drowsiness. you have been warned. so, how does green grocer stack up to the two previous sets you ask? well, follow along kind reader and i shall attempt to unravel this question. the box: the gigantic box is pretty standard and looks amazingly similar to the caf? corner box. the back of the box shows some of the features of the green grocer as well as a lot of the cool interior that was absent from the previous sets. in addition, we are shown an image of the three sets together and a small insert image showing how they connect together (as if we could not master that difficult maneuver?) opening the box is a matter of breaking two seals. as it seems to be the norm now, we have the reusable cereal box type tab system that we saw so often in 2007 sets. however, upon opening the tabs we are pleasantly surprised to find a cardboard tray! have not seen one of those in a while. as you can see in the photo, we have two 32x16 green base plates, three instruction manuals and a bunch of bags that are broken into four groups: group 1 has 12 bags and goes with the first manual and builds the first floor. group 2 has 9 bags and goes with the second manual to build the second floor. group 3 has 14 bags and goes with the third manual for the top floor and roof. and one bag that is not numbered and hence you can open it whenever you feel like it. there are no stickers ? yay! moving right along, we get to the three instruction manuals. the manuals: the three manuals are 55, 47 and 47 pages in length. they are laid out well and are pretty standard with all the usual trimmings: - piece call outs for each step - parts inventory at the end of the second manual - page numbers color separation in these manuals was fine for me except dark bley and black. we get a nice photo of all three sets together: plus, we get a nice tip showing how to split up the bags and what goes where. those additional pieces you see in the photo just below the numbered bags are the pieces that come from the single un-numbered bag (along with the base plates). parts list random manual shot the pieces: upon opening the first set of bags, one thing is clear; there are a ton of little tiny pieces! the minifigs are included in this first section as well. interesting to note that there are a handful of printed pieces and as i mentioned previously, no stickers. we also get a host of new and exciting pieces to add to our collection. keep in mind my scope of lego sets is generally centered around star wars, technic, creator and the occasional racer set so what is new to me might have been around 15 years. at any rate, here are some of the more interesting pieces: again, note the printed tiles. this time around, lego has decided to include 33% more minifigs than the caf? corner and market street sets. yes, we get four minifigs instead of three! here are the cast of characters: pictured (left to right) is sir top hat, miss jenny blue overalls, patti o? furniture and little timmy cub scout. i?ll leave it up to the minifig aficionados to decipher which torsos are new and to tell us all about the hairpieces. i can say with reasonable certainty that the four yellow smiley heads are not new (somebody check that?) don?t forget the lovable little cat named ?tom?. he is the arch-rival of the mouse ?jerry? that lives downstairs: overall, there are a lot of pieces, large variety and wide range of colors. the build: if you have either of the two previous sets, you will feel right at home here. just like in the previous builds, it seems like the first ten build steps are consumed with laying a bunch of 1x1, 1x2 and 2x2 tiles everywhere. almost feels like 30% of the pieces are used up right away (see below). there are several sections where you build various parts of the interior. take a look at the cash register/counter below: and the beverage cooler: and the produce stand and everything that goes in it: looks like someone has mail: looks like someone just had a baby: this set is incredibly well done and gives inspiration to go back and add similar items to caf? corner and market street. as before, the average builder is introduced to some new building techniques like using the hinge plates to make the angles on the front of the building as shown below: also the top of the roof shows some interesting ideas: overall, it is a really fun build that kept me entertained the whole way. the design: this is a great set with lots of little details. i especially like the little mouse hole in the wall leading to the jerry the mouse?s area. they even included a little slice of cheese! it seems the designers can?t get away from the ?usual? staircase which i always feel is way too big. maybe future designs can incorporate a spiral staircase to save room for other things in the model. one welcome addition is the fire escape as seen below: i?m going to show a bunch of examples of various items in the set so you can get the feel of the amazing detail in this design. take a look at the lamps (torches?) just outside the door: and the streetlight with fire hydrant: brickwork and archway: awning: here is the back side of the building. note the trashcans and yard tools: here is a close-up of the railings on the second story balcony and the second photo is the finished product with curtains in the window. nice use of cups to make the banister on the second floor: here is the fireplace on the second floor: second floor staircase with tom?s hiding spot: check out the radiator on the third floor: more third floor: nice grandfather clock and rug (third floor) check out the deck that is up on the roof. complete with two chairs, table, umbrella, flower pots and grill: interesting use of minifig hammers on the roof: finally, here is what is left over when we?re done: a couple of shots of the front: a shot of the back: and here are all three together: overall thoughts: this is an incredible set and the best of the three in my opinion. it is hard to top caf? corner but i believe green grocer just did. i absolutely love all the details and building techniques that went into making this set. there is a ton of different parts and wide color selection. as usual, we get a bunch of tiles and small plates, but that goes with the series. also, we get four minifigs and lots of minifig accessories. i?m giving this set a score of 100%! i thought about it and i really don?t know how they could have made it any better. in short, run don?t walk to go pick this set up! final rating: 100% build 10/10 (excellent - lots of nice interiors, details and accessories to build.) functionality 10/10 (outstanding. raises the bar with interior and detail. think caf? corner on steroids.) design 10/10 (excellent ? can?t say enough good things about it.) parts 10/10 (great selection and diverse colors. great minifigs.) price 10/10 (price ratio is excellent but lots and lots of little parts. well worth the price.) as alway, feel free to comment, complain and question what you see here. i'd like to hear your feedback on this amazing set.

1 wow! that's a great review i'm glad you took so many pictures, this set is far better than i ever expected it to be, the detail inside is great. is it the first set you'e given 100% to?

1 a great reveiw dunamis *y* . you have only backed up what i thought when the pictures first appeared, if you are a lego fan there is no excuse not to buy this set. it is a must have! i love the mouse hole and the mouse and his cheese *wub* .

1 very nice. very nice, indeed. lots of lovely, little details, even at the back. this review hasn't changed my opinion one bit, i'm still looking forward to when i can finally pick up mine at the post office. i'm crossing my fingers that there will be more buildings following after this one. i'm guessing that lego's just testing the waters to see how far afol's are willing to go regarding price vs. details. green grocer is still epic, though.

1 for some silly (and quite delusional) reason i thought that i had a chance to review this first... :-d but yours is at your house, and mine is (hopefully) winging it's way to me... :'-) thanks for the review! it will help me survive until mine arrives. i love this set. *wub* hopefully there will be many more stunning sets like this to come. *sweet* xwingyoda, on mar 8 2008, 08:03 pm, said: i didn't know green grocer had a rodent infestation !! neither did i and i have looked through the instructions at least three times... :-$

1 *runs to lego store in bluewater...* m.

1 man, these sets are so awesome. incredible work done by the designers there, must have took a long time to get all this ogether. if they weren't too expensive i would go and buy them all 3 right away *wub*

1 damn it ! what a great great review ! i definitly love this set !!!! burn credit card, burn ! you're the must in there dunamis ! many thanks !

1 like the set, this review also deserves a 10/10. i've ordered this set yesterday on s@h. seeing and reading this review, i'm convinced it will be worth the money. so, bonaparte is finally entering the city theme !!!

1 this is a nice review, thanks for all the great pictures!

1 truly an awesome review. thanks dunamis. i ordered my two copies (one to build, one to store in the "vault") last week. can't wait to get this one! the attention to detail here is what makes the set great. there's nothing to criticize about this set. it's really the closest thing to perfection that i have seen from tlc. the difference between this set and cc is the interior detail, and because of that, gg now become (in my opinion) the best set ever released by tlc. do the cc/gg/ms sets fit well with the 50th anniv. town plan? my impression is that out of the box, at least, they don't. which is too bad. however, i don't think it would be hard to mod the town plan so it looks like it belongs in the same town as cc/gg/ms. these sets, to me, are what i have always wanted from tlc as an adult. i hope they keep up the line, and add more elements to this excellent lineup.

1 thanks for all the feedback. as you can tell, i really enjoyed building it. cardinal brick, on mar 8 2008, 09:26 am, said: is it the first set you'e given 100% to? yes, it is. i gave cafe corner a 96% and i felt this was a better set and improved on the things that i dinged cafe corner on (lack of minifigs was one thing.) that's why i enjoy reading the comments so i can see if my ratings are in line with what everyone else thinks and to see if i missed anything. i can't wait for some of you to build it and share your thoughts as well.

1 a very fine review with great and informative pictures, thanks dunamis! *y* and what a wonderful set, a masterpiece and far beyond everything i would?ve expected just one year ago.... the amount of details is exceptional, from the different railings to the mousehole and the radiator.... sheer brilliant. :'-) and two female mfs (or hippies, you never know....) and a child.... only one adult male character who nearly looks like.... well, anyways. it?s simply a milestone, and a very creative and inspiring beauty. *wub* easter parade on! and, sweet gg.... will you marry me? :-$

1 a very informative review, indeed. thank you so much for doing so. now i know that the price is worth every penny leaving my pocket. ;-) what do you guys think is tlc putting up as the next modular set? is it asking too much of tlc to produce 1 modular set each quarter (4 times a year)?

1 a million thanks for this review. this is greater than i thought. i especially like that clock. i'm going to get this set as soon as possible.

1 :-) amazing!!! great review!!! :-d u have totalyl convinced me to get this set! its so wonderful, filled with great details. what a waste, i can't order it in s@h because i am from singapore :'-( i hope it will come to my country, so i am able to buy it!!! :-)

1 thank you for the amazing review dunamis! this set looks amazing *wub* i won't be able to afford it though :'-( congrats! this is on the frontpage *y* *sweet*

1 great review. thanks for taking the time to do this. this has been a great line. at the risk of abandoning my castle/adventurer loyalties. i've got to say this is rapidly becoming my favorite line and this set looks to be the best of the lot. while it still hurts to shell out $150, i think i'll still be happy to do so. steve

1 thank you sooo much for this amazing review dunamis! i absolutly adore this set and you've review has prompted me to certainetly start saving! (i have a bit left over form christmas that will come in handy! :-d ) i love the little fridge downstairs, the fire escape and the mouse hole, alot more good ideas that we can all use in creating our own buildings! this line is by far my favorite lego line ever! (yes even beats starwars, but only just ;-) ) hooray for dunamis! x-d

1 i?ve got something, i want to share with you. a beautiful dream came true: #1: the box: top: back: the alternate model is also very well done. the pneumatics dump the bucket and open the flap (?). open: you can see a diagram how the pneumatics work. just a happy kid playing. the plastic inlays (?): all: #2: the parts: as you can see, 8854 offers a very large variety of different parts. loads of technic bricks, gears and even plates. also note the threaded axle 10, 5 large pulleys, a big turntable and the 1x20 rack. #3: building: the mechanism for the outriggers and the rotation of the turntable: the turntable: the pneumatics are finished: the mechanism for the telescope: the finished model: #4 random shots: you can see how the turntable will be rotated. thanks for reading- erm? viewing the pictures! please comment if you want to!

1 really cool set! this has convinced me that i really want it!

1 wow, another old technic set review by you. nice set, and thanks for that review.

0 looks like you have the original 1989 version with the yellow top cylinders. :-) i got one too several years ago, although i probably paid too much for it. :-p on a side note, if that pneumatic tubing feels harder and stiffer than the modern type, i highly recommend that you don't use it and buy some of the newer stuff off bricklink instead. tlc originally used a different material for the tubes and this stuff degrades the nozzles (on pistons, switches and so on) over time. the old tubes also grip the nozzles much more firmly and if you aren't careful when removing them, it's actually possible to rip off the nozzles completely. x-o i had this happen a few years ago, although tlc replaced my broken pistons for free. i got rid of that stuff for good after that, although the pistons on my power crane still have slightly discolored nozzles. edited by cp5670, 10 march 2008 - 04:57 am.

1 thanks for another fun review! this set is high on my list of things to buy, i love cranes, built many and bought many including the classic 8460 from 1995 and the more recent 8421. that threaded axle never stopped intriguing me... it was use in so few sets (i believe 8851 contained one as well?) and i still don't know why it's better than any other axle. congratulations with a near mint copy of this set! :-)

0 simonwillems, on mar 10 2008, 01:32 pm, said: that threaded axle never stopped intriguing me... it was use in so few sets (i believe 8851 contained one as well?) and i still don't know why it's better than any other axle. the purpose of the threaded axle is to carry tension. regular axles are used primarily for carrying torsion (for gears), sometimes for compression (8855 landing gear, helicopter skids), and sometimes just for looks (roll cages, canopies). but used in tension, connectors will usually just pop off. with the threads and the corresponding nuts, this part can be used to squeeze parts together (like the pen in the plotter of 8094), or to hold heavy assemblies onto turntables (like 8862 and 8851). with the power crane (8854) reviewed here, that is the complete list of sets which used this part. i wrote about it here: http://www.ericalbre...1984.html#parts eric

1 as i bought it, i didn't even know i would also get a box. it just said: all parts with building instructions. after opening the parcel i was like: "woah... woooaaahhh" and so on. ;-) i love lego-boxes because as a child i stood in the toy stores starring at the boxes, only seeing the front and the back, nothing more. this brings back some memories... :'-)

0 blakbird, on mar 10 2008, 09:45 pm, said: i wrote about it here: http://www.ericalbre...1984.html#parts eric thanks for that information, it opened my eyes as to the function of the threaded axle! :-)

1 this was my first technic set, aged 7! still a great one in terms of function density, and a great b-model. in the uk i'm certain it was called the "salvage hoist".

0 hi! this is my third (old-school) technic set review! i don?t want to talk much, please enjoy just the pictures! #1 the parts: #2 building: the two axles, you can see in the middle, are not connected and don?t belong to each other. the axle on the left side is for the steering, on the right side for the engine. the dark-gray ?technic gear 16 tooth with clutch? allows the connection from the differential gear to the engine, trough the axle for the steering. the v6-engine: the winch: that?s a part you don?t see everyday: a 1x2 rack. it only reappears in 2 sets from 2001 and 2004. (the rebel wrecker has been released in 1994.) the ?front double wishbone with anti-sway bar?-suspension (yeah, i got it from technopedia! x-d ) the finished model: #3 random shots: i really like this picture! authoritative, isn?t it? 8-? :-d thanks for viewing the pictures! please comment if you want to!

1 thanks for reviewing all these old sets! will you be doing any more?

1 yeah. if i rebuild and wash a model i will record it. glad to see you liked it!

1 this set is really cool. i might actually get it!

1 ah a good old retro review. those old school days had some pretty impressive sets, with alot more complexity than modern sets. if you have it may i recommend 8880?

1 nice pictures. i also sort out the pieces the same way if i'm rebuilding a model. *y* this set packs a lot of functionality into a fairly small size, but was rather expensive for its size ($70) when it was still available, compared to other sets of that time. you can also rig up the technic flag sticker that it comes with to the main model. i've done that on mine. you may want to reinforce it with tape if you're going to leave the model on display though, as it will break up over time due to uv exposure like many stickers do. i had to do that with mine after it started to crack, although it still looks pretty good.

1 thanks for reviewing this classic set. i got it when it first came out and still love it: the suspension, steering and robust look of the model haven't been done that well ever since. this set puzzled me though, back in the days. the rear suspending part containing the differential and some gears was shown different on the box from the instructions. in the instructions it showed that the (grey part of the suspension) in the back had to be made using a 1x2 smooth tile and 4 cornerplates (2x2) in grey. the box however showed a much sturdier solution using a 1x8 tile and a 1x8 plate. it is also visible on the cover of the instructions. the pieces i mean are in this picture: bernddasbrot, on mar 9 2008, 07:05 pm, said: otherwise, great set!

0 thanks! you've just motivated me to go on a "senseless-preliminary-design-errors-hunt"...! a few things i've discovered: left side (alternate model): the steering link can only be put in place with a little violence... the handlebar (?) is turned (far more than it's actually possible) although the wheels are straight. right side: the 1x8 tile simonwillems pointed out the half bush right next to it is... *can't_find_the_words* ..."wrong". could be that the technic triangle is missing. the "windscreen"- 1x6 technic plates are mounted with 1/2 pins instead of axle pins with half bushes. who can find more...? x-d

1 bernddasbrot, on mar 10 2008, 05:56 pm, said: you've just motivated me to go on a "senseless-preliminary-design-errors-hunt"...! man..., this set is a disaster what were they thinking! :-d :-p i just remembered one other fun aspect of this set: the crane hook can be attached to the underside of the rear bumper, to hold it in position while driving along, but when things are like this and you try and wind up the cable the winch is strong enough to break the (original provided lego) rope.... it 'worked' with my copy. :-d so this set is capable of demolishing itself.... but still, one of the best technicsets i have, with all stickers intact. i'm not so sure about that flag though, must check on that.

1 a neat review of a cool set with very informative pictures, thanks bernddasbrot! *y*

0 bernddasbrot, on mar 10 2008, 01:41 pm, said: at my school leaving examination i made a model in blender3d and explained to the board of examiners how to build a car and how to animate it. it needed a color, so i took red "because all beautiful and fast cars are red..." my physics teacher contradicted. :-) did you use ferrari to prove your point? any physics teacher would have to admit that a really fast car, approaching the speed of light, will always look red as it drives away due to red shift!! x-d on the other hand, 8880 looks pretty fast and it is black, although i have seen pictures of one that someone built in red. yellow might be good too. some cars even look fast in green. eric

0 that price is exceptional. it's less than what i paid for mine 9 years ago, and is even less than the original price of the set. note that the stickers in this set are the bad variety that will crack and peel over time. if you want to preserve them (the technic flag in particular), you will need to tape over it.

1 somehow i also managed to get this set in very good condition (including box, instructions and all stickers) for a mere 22 a few months ago. this is indeed a very special set, and was a pleasure to build. the only flaw i noticed was weak support of the rear drivetrain, which was easily corrected with a few extra plates.

0 grepin, on mar 24 2010, 12:37 am, said: ........ the only flaw i noticed was weak support of the rear drivetrain, which was easily corrected with a few extra plates. huh? like where? don't have that much problems with that rear train.

(at least if i you don't trow the model down the stairs or something like that...) maybe it's unusual, but this section of the drive train didn't hold that well on my model: this is how it looks now: the parts made redundant were left in the built model, that's why there's that useless 8-tooth gear there :p

-1 a nice review, well done! *y* the set itself doesn?t look quite interesting to me, compared with some of the newer ones like 7647 or 7648.... the way the driver fits into the cockpit looks not very clever and pretty uncomfortable as well.... x-d

-1 thanx for the review. i have one question. do these aliens have moving arms? as far as the set goes i think lego did a bad job on the alien ship. i dont think any of the alien ships look good in mars mission the human fanction got a lot better this year and i would have bought this buggy if it came by its self..

-1 my friend has this set and the alien ship's wings are wobbly and overall :-x he may have built it wrong, i'm not sure, i didn't see the build. anyways, nice review! *y*

1 sweet first pic review! *y* i got this set for a birthday present last year, and it is pretty fun overall. the alien ship in this set is actually one of my favorites. it just looks cool, and the way you can fold it out is really clever. the only negative for me is the cockpit of the mining unit. not really because it isn't detailed, but because mine is top heavy, and keeps falling forward. it's kinda funny if you think about him driving along and then falling forward...but not funny at all when you're playing. |-/

0 thank you for your nice review, vbbn! *y* but it only confirms: this theme is not my cup of tea. weird aliens, strange colors, parts stuck together with no idea. :-| i always hated this big wheels - it?s even worse in orange. :-x saving money for different sets on! (and that doesn?t mean it was a bad review ;-) )

1 holodoc: i agree with you. and the buety of being a custom parts maker is that i can recolor these... :-) *y* athos: sure, buddy. they have moving arms, legs, (a real mf!) the arms and legs are the same just flipped. :-) edited by ~vbbn~, 14 march 2008 - 01:12 am.

1 thanks for the review! i do like this set, though i am not a fan of the jelly aliens, though the alien ship looks good with the curved parts and flip open and close design!

1 well, as bad a concept aliensvshumans is for a theme... i really do like this set. the human rover has nice parts for reuse, especially those oldschool space wheels. and despite those wobbly wings, i really like the alien ship. goes from a flying saucer-ish shape to a spread winged almost raven shape, very ominous and cool looking. now that 'alien commander' is terrible... if i don't buy bionicle minifigs already, why would i be interested in that thing? kinda wish they'd take the drones from the retiring exoforce theme and do them in green, they'd make nice alien robot things...

1 great review! thanks for taking the time. i'm glad to see another reviewer out there as there are a lot of sets to cover. nicely done.

1 hi! this is my forth (old-school) technic set review! since blakbird pointed out that all my technic reviews are red, i chose a yellow dune blaster for today! just kidding. this set is red as it should be! (don't worry my next reviews will be yellow and black... uhhh forshadowing... ;-) ) i will start with some facts! 277 elements and released in 1994 that's enough. #1: the box: #2: the parts: #3: building instructions and catalogues: wow! no folds, no wear marks - simply: *wub* "was lesen coole kids?" - "klick! das super magazin fuer coole kids!" (how obvious...) #4: building: no differential. i really love the way the 1x8 technic bricks on the sides will be positioned later. fun fact: the engine contains no 2l-technic axle. ...and finished. a real quick build. #5: spare parts: ...for the alternate model. the yellow technic handle should be from 8412. maybe a bonus feature from the seller! #6: random shots: #7: final thoughts: this is my second 8829 and i also noticed that the engine turns very hard. the alternate model is really (sorry to all those of you who like it) crappy. i mean- a nice idea, but not with this wheels! :-| anyway: a really beautiful technic-set! *reminiscing* (this word exists, does it?) thanks for viewing the pictures, i hope you enjoyed it! please comment if you want to! edited by bernddasbrot, 21 march 2008 - 02:09 pm.

1 that looks like a very nice set! :-) in your opinion, how does it compare to the current dune buggy? -toa of justice

0 i don't own the 8296, but what i can see from the pictures, i would say that 8296 is very similar to 8829. the only things that are different ist that 8296 is studless and features a steering wheel for the seat. but 8829 has got bigger wheels... >:-) it also would have been nice, if the wheels from 8296 could have the same tread.

1 a very good review with fine and informative pictures, and a really nice set, thanks, bernddasbrot. *sweet* hmm, i really wish that tlc would make some steerable cars within the system line too....

1 great set, great review, although the set looks better in yellow. :-d

1 toa_of_justice, on mar 21 2008, 08:10 am, said: that looks like a very nice set! :-) in your opinion, how does it compare to the current dune buggy? -toa of justice imho, 8829 is much better than 8296. first, 8829 is a lot bigger. i really like the huge rear balloon tires. they both have rack and pinion steering, and they both have trailing arm rear suspension with a v-2 engine. i think the body on 8829 is a little more well done. for 8296, i think the alternate tractor model is much better. for more comparisons, see technicopedia. eric

0 pictures of my restored set 8829 (i was almost 96% complete, and for missing parts i add of my own) the seat is black and not blue (as one was missing in my 8858) the spoiler is different, steering wheel added (not connected to wheels) and some additional items to make it look better) this is how i change the tire orientation the "new" rear spoiler: i still need to "clean" front rims edited by aow, 26 november 2015 - 12:32 pm.

1 wow! this buggy was my very first lego set. i like this review - it remembered my childhood. i also liked its body with those 8 studs long bricks on sides. i can also remember trying to build engine in such way that it works smooth without success. anyway i think its "studless version" - set 8048 is much better.

1 finally, after a very frustrating incident with the internet explorer 7's 'back' button, i present to you my very first review. this is a review of set 8158 speed racer vs snake oiler, it's also the first review of a speed racer set on eurobricks. also you should know that i didn't put the stickers on as they can be quite valuable later on down the road, so i'm sorry for the lack of stickers. :-$ so without further ado i present to you my first review. he he, that rhymes. :-d edit: i just finished resizing the pics and uploading them to brickshelf after having a heated argument about when my bedtime is with my mother. so, i will be doing a complete redo of the picture portion of my review of set 8158. i'm going to work on that as soon as i finish typing this message... edit 2: review fully redone now, *sighs*, that took forever. edit 3: almost forgot to put in a new link to its brickshelf folder. this is v.2 of my review of set 8158, enjoy... theme: speed racer set:8158 speed racer vs snake oiler price: $19.99us pieces: 242 minifigs: 2 first off pics of the box, instructions, dss, minifigs, and new parts: there are so many stickers they had to number them! x-o so's sunglasses are chrome gold. 8-? close-up of the hemets. new parts include, first system lego hubcap, new more curvy fenders, curved windshield, and a s-shaped connector piece. now onto the build, first speed racer's mach 5: back part of the car. the cockpit of the car. they connect with the new s-shaped piece. front part of the car. front and cockpit also connected using the new s-shaped piece. side view of the car, so far. underside of the car, so far. adding more detail. ground level front view of the car. side view with added detail. underside with newly added axles. demonstrating how the new hubcaps are put on. now on to building snake oilers orange-ilicious racer: back part of the car. the cockpit of the car. they are connected using the s-shaped piece. front part of the car with seemingly random color choices. *wacko* the front and cockpit are also connected using the new s-shaped piece. adding orange-irific fenders. side view of the car so far. adding more detail. smoothing things over. ground level view with lime green "eyes" and white "fangs". side view with more detail. rearword view of the car with newly added cuve-acious windshield. no hubcaps!?! :-| now onto finished views of both cars, first the mach 5: side view with sweet hubcaps. up close and personal with the mach 5. a rearend shot. "i got hubcaps, i got hubcaps!", speed racer. now so's snake racer, yes thats what i'm calling it. :-p :-d beautiful! blurry, :-$ rearend pic. "watchout it bites!", snake oiler he's ready to take on sr, hubcaps or no hubcaps! >:-) racin'! now for some comparison shots: hope you all like v.2 better then v.1, i know i liked it better. x-d seriously though i even learned a thing or two doin' this last version. ;-) now it's time for my summary: overall a very well designed and executed set. it's only downfalls are that there are way too many stickers, 32 to be exact, :-| and there are no cool contraptions on the cars to take out the other racer. a great buy for $19.99, i reccomend this set to everybody because of the reasons i staed above and because even i, who is not a big fan of speed racer, x-o was drawn to this spectacular little set. price: 10/10 pieces: 8/10 too many stickers. minifigs: 9/10 needed some accessories. playability: 8/10 needs some cool contraptions on the cars to take out the other racer. overall: 35/40 general tarful edited by imperialshadows, 01 june 2008 - 12:07 pm.

1 can't wait to get me one of those!!

1 what store did you find this at? x-o great review.

0 general tarful, please resize those pics. even with the new re-size feature, people are having a tough time reading your review because it takes time for the tool to work. check out the picture resize tutorial here and some other handy tutorials here. thanks.

0 lasse d, on mar 22 2008, 06:54 pm, said: i found all the april released speed racers sets in the shop in legoland. i was going to post a review tuesday of this set, but i can see i'm too late. now i cross my fingers for the fierce creatures set doesn't get "taken" as well. i would like to comment on the review, but the pictures are too big - it simply takes too long to load. regarding that new resize function. i can see it does "nearest neighbor" rescaling. doesn't it resize to less than 640x480? i thought that was the standard for forum post pictures. 800 x 600

1 thanks for the picture packed review! :-d i love snake oiler's car, it's so... orange! *wub* *wub* and sleek, and smooth, and sexy... x-d thanks again! ~peace

0 hmm.... very interesting. thanks for the review, generaltarful. *y* both cars, although pretty wide, look still very sleek and fast. especially from the side. and solid, too.... but the front of the mach 5 without the stickers.... i dont know. from some angles it looks good, and a little bad from some other.... 8-| sticker mayhem, again, but very useful parts nevertheless. btw, what was the price..? and, hinckley, do you have a brother or is this just the start of a new career? :-p

1 thanks for the review. *sweet* i love these sets... but buying them will depend on the australian price. just to be a nag, you really need to reduce the picture size. remember that whie the pictures are resized by the forum software, this is done browser side so it isn't as useful as it would seem. the full picture is still loaded, just the same as brickshelf. legofranks, on mar 23 2008, 10:49 am, said: i'm sorry, but your review has only served to further enlighten me that these sets are a pile of cack! absolutely lazy design and the only reason i'd get one is for the windscreen so i can build a proper landspeeder from star wars... m. i'm surprised you feel that way. i think these sets are great and i love how they are no where near as juniorised as i feared.

1 yay, finally! thanks for the great review. it confirmed that i am most definately getting these *wub* the orange racer is absolutley beautiful! once again, awesome review! *sweet*

0 generaltarful, on mar 23 2008, 07:24 pm, said: you're welcome hinkley, it wasn't that time consuming. ;-) ... :-d you're actually responding to a quote from sinner. but don't worry, a lot of people mix us up... and thank you for resizing all of the pics! *sweet*

0 brickmaster, on mar 24 2008, 12:18 am, said: i definately prefer 8159, in terms of minifigs, and useful parts colors to me :-$ but the cars are all the same basic design. thanks for the review. and i actually love the stickers. this means i won't have to rub off all the print, and if wanted, i can use stickers elsewhere :-$ i prefer 8159 too, because of the minifigs mostly. x-d anyways the review of set 8159 is now open for viewing pleasure... just click here. yes they all have the same basic design... so far. i never thought of stickers like that, thanks for enlightening me. :-) you are most definitly welcome brickmaster! ;-) general tarful edited by tarfful, 27 march 2008 - 09:19 pm.

0 thanks for resizing the pics. it is strange that you didn't know about that z-piece before. it was well used in old space sets. the cars are pretty nice, but i think the people sit way too high in them - the windscreen gives almost no protection. i am planning on modifying them to 7 studs wide since that's my current standard for this kind of race cars (seriously!). looking forward to the next review.

1 doctor sinister, on mar 22 2008, 09:56 pm, said: and here's the kit complete. build time, about ten seconds if you pick your nose whilst you are doing it. :-d dr. s. and i thought the visors were really supposed to be gold. :-| thanks doc, that was quick! this looks like a very nice, simple set. i'll probaly get one of these. except it comes with one of those hideous faces! ( that's right, i'm talking to you micvash and phred! ) *sweet*

1 i want that set so badly. i went to a lego store last weekend and they only had the fire and police ones. :'-( i want it for the metal detector. serious whackin' instrument >:-) .

0 pencoin, on jun 3 2008, 12:50 pm, said: nice review the set doesnt seem as good as the crystal hawk and there colouring mistake with gun is just well bad and not the kind of thing i expect tlc to do something that stupid colouring mistake? do tell.

0 as i mentioned elsewhere, i couldn't see a review for this and though it's only small, let's strive for completion! here's the box: the contents: the parts: leftover bits: and the set: not much to it i know, and not much of a review, but there you go...quite a lot of stuff with the copper though. dr. s.

1 big or small we all love our legos, and for that i thank you for the review. i would have had liked to see your opinions though, about the price, the playability, or anything else you'd care to share about it and perhaps how it fits with your collection. i've always been hesitant about getting this set because to me i feel like i have it all already, but i'm missing that dog, radar gun and, 50 mph sign :-/

1 a very neat and useful little set, thank you for the nice review. *sweet*

0 hi! this is my forth pre-old-school review. as promised: a yellow-set ! my 8862 arrived today, survived the washing machine coaster and actually was real fun to build! #1: information: this set contains 664 parts (only! i thought id be far more!) and was released in 1989 in the technic theme. be sure to visit technopediaif you want to know more! #2: building instructions: wow these instructions are used! i'm not used to this after all this sets with unread instruction booklets... the pneumatics page: the last step for the alternate model: #3: the parts: wow! look at all those technic beams, gears, pins...! (a few parts are missing in this photo!) #3: building: the left worm gear is for the outriggers, the right one for turning the rear boom the three 12l axles: left one: outriggers, middle one: steering, right one: erm rear-boom-rotation. the two worm gears in the front part: left one: lifting the bucket, right one: dumping the bucket. the turning-mechanism for the rear-boom is finished. once again a toothed 10l axle. the boat weight 2x6x2 is hidden underneath the radiator grill. okay many hoses and a nice, comfy seat have been added. now you can recognize the backhoes real shape. only with a little violence its possible to lift the bonnet (?) through the pneumatic pump. yeah, outriggers. same technique that the 8854 uses. the finished boom / jib / scoop thing (=bjst) :-| x-d the finished loader bucket. and to end the building process: the same picture from the introduction. (off-topic: it is all part of the miracle of nature! - the circle of life! #4: functionality: this time, i tried something new! i hope you can spot something - if not: technopedia! okay, here we go. #5: random shots: ive got way too many pictures this time, so i refer to my brickshelf folder. until its moderated you can follow the multilingual links! eins deux three quattro fem zes sdem osiem #6: final thoughts: definitely worth buying! as a child i thought it looks hideous - but today ive found out its totally fun to build and freaking functional. three things i want to mention though: the bjst can only be slewed (a new word!) if the outriggers are deployed. it is also possible that the bjst will reach the ground (danger of grinding or sticking) even if the outriggers are deployed. the two mechanisms for the loader bucket can actually interlock, and the 14 tooth gears might break / disentangle from the axle. thanks for viewing the pictures, i hope you enjoyed it! please comment if you want to!

1 ah, what a very fine classic set.... and all these lovely technic beams with studs! *wub* thank you very much for that excellent review, bernd, and you did a fantastic job with all these great pictures! :'-) *y*

1 thanks for the review. it looks beautiful. my father was a backhoe driver, so understandably i used to drool over this set in the catalogs. i never did get it though as lego was so expensive in australia then; i had around 2000 pieces and i thought i had loads! :-d anyway, last year i bought 8455, which i love; it works great with a compressor i made too! *sweet* i wish mine had a real cab though... :'-( do you have 8455 as well? i'd love to see how they compare side by side... it looks bigger than 8455 but i don't own any of the big old chuncky tires so i find it so hard to tell. by the way, i have been reading all of your reviews but i have been a bit busy of late so i haven't had time to comment. i hope you have more planned; any chance of a supercar one?

1 another nice review. the slow shutter speed pictures are great. i think that was the only set with 8 distinct functions for a very long time and was only displaced by the 8455 backhoe in that respect. the turntable on the back doesn't turn very well though, as the weight is all distributed on one side. the screw axle prevents it from popping off but there is still a lot of friction in it. i don't have mine built anymore but it might be worth trying to put a weight brick or something on it. quote do you have 8455 as well? i'd love to see how they compare side by side... it looks bigger than 8455 but i don't own any of the big old chuncky tires so i find it so hard to tell. yeah, it's quite a bit bigger. when everything is fully extended, it becomes something like 26" long. although the 8455 actually has more/better functionality. edited by cp5670, 24 march 2008 - 08:15 am.

1 thanks for your feedback! i like both, but i would say 8455 is far more than just a studless version! with 10 pneumatic cylinders and 2 pneumatic pumps it's a wonderful set for every pneumatic freak. unfortunately i don't own the 8455 - yet. ;-) sinner said: i hope you have more planned; any chance of a supercar one? i foreshadowed a black review a few days ago... guess which one... x-o x-d

-1 bernddasbrot, on mar 24 2008, 05:08 pm, said: there are ~324 axle nuts on bricklink with an avg price of $0.89. but i wants it cheap! *sing* and i would still call 324 quite rare. and i also want to just tack it onto another order. *sad*

0 yeah, i meant they're rare. ;-) but i can imagine that a normal axle with the old half bushes will help. sometimes these are really strong; if you put 2-3 in a row? edit: i just tried it: a normal 10l axle with 2 interlocking old half bushes type 1 on each end. (i chose those who only can be moved very hardly along an axle.) i slewed the bjst / back arm a few times tried the pneumatics parallel to it and it didn't loose. edited by bernddasbrot, 24 march 2008 - 06:06 pm.

1 thanks! *sweet*

0 quote there are ~324 axle nuts on bricklink with an avg price of $0.89. i didn't know of this accessory-set: 5110-2... you can buy it for $40.00 8-? i was thinking of getting one of those off bl several years ago, back when the price used to be more like $15 or so, but i realized that i hardly ever use the couple that i already have. :-p they came out with the modern turntable the year after this set, which mostly negated the need for these screw axles. i think their only use now is to hold non-lego objects onto models, like the technic pen in 8094. i guess you can try to make linear actuators out of them, but they're often too rare and fragile for that.

0 slyowl, on mar 24 2008, 07:53 pm, said: thanks! *sweet* glad to see that i could help! cp5670 said: i guess you can try to make linear actuators out of them could you explain your thoughts please? you know: my english skills ;-)

"slewed"? i think that's a word. how about "slewn" or "slain" or "slewifacated"? i think "rotated" is best. *sweet* eric

1 wow thanks for putting up this thread, that reminded me that i own that one too. *sweet* and i loved it as a kid.

1 by the way, don't forget to build the alternate model of 8862. it is a combine (farm equipment) which is just as good as 8274. i liked it so much that i bought two copies of this set so i could display both. my favorite alternate model (not counting universal sets) is the 8480 submarine. maybe it is time for a white set review? *skull* white is pretty rare. for your blue set, i recommend you review 8462. there are only a couple of green sets, and 8479 is the best. and then of course, 8458 is silver!! i think we all know what the best black set is. and according to your photography, you have lots of them! but don't forget 8868. eric

0 bernddasbrot, on mar 24 2008, 05:39 pm, said: could you explain your thoughts please? you know: my english skills ;-) i was thinking you could somehow attach a 16-tooth dark gray gear (the one that spins freely around axles) to the nut, which would make the axle move in and out when the gear turned and convert the gear's rotary motion to linear motion in a fairly compact package. although there are other ways of doing the same thing that don't use such rare parts, and the 2008 technic sets will come with pre-built linear actuators anyway.

0 bernddasbrot, on mar 25 2008, 03:46 am, said: 15 seconds. wow, that's a long exposure. i would think you would get way too much light and overexpose the image. the aperture must have been tiny. quote i will review it too and post it in this topic! cool. i am also planning to write about the combine on technicopedia. combine quote actually i took it from your site! x-d i thought that word sounded familiar! quote unfortunately i don't own 8480 but i think 8824 is also a very good (though small) white set! 8462 rocks as a blue set. i just got it a few weeks ago. let's see... 8462 also is one of the last technic sets i would call old-school. 8479... okay too, but 8458 is imho not. 8868 and the totally mysteriously black set will follow...! you don't own 8480? that is unacceptable. it is imperative that you put a mortgage on your house immediately to get it! *sweet* yes, 8824 is a good white set. i also see from your room photos that you have the 8839 supply ship which has lots of white. this is a really nice set. 8462 is hard to call old school, but at least it uses regular beams. the air tanks are the best part of the set. i wish lego had used them more often, especially on the highly pneumatic sets. the tank makes all the difference on 8459. you are right, 8458 is certainly not old school, but it is a great set with wonderful suspension. it is of the same era as the super street sensation with all of the panels for body contouring. 8868 is technic at its best. there is nothing else like it, especially with the compressor. quote did you had something like this in mind if the toothed 10l axle rotates the axle nuts want to rotate too but they can't because of that 2x4 technic plate. so they'll decide to move along the axle. the 1x6 bricks on each end make sure that the axle won't move in or out. thanks for your feedback! while the assembly you have drawn would work as a linear actuator, i would not recommend it. the torsional stiffness and strength of an axle are proportional to the polar moment of inertia, a section property. most of the stiffness comes from the outside of the cross shaped axle. but in the threaded axle, you lose all the stiffness of the outer area because it is not continuous. this means you only get stiffness and strength from the small core. i think the threaded axle would bend and break very easily if subjected to much torque. eric

1 quote 8462 rocks as a blue set. i just got it a few weeks ago. let's see... 8462 also is one of the last technic sets i would call old-school. 8479... okay too, but 8458 is imho not. yeah, the tow truck was the last set that still used mainly studded beams. they made many changes to technic the following year, with models becoming predominantly studless and making heavy use of the flexible axles/hoses and decorative panels. the technic logo and box art style was also changed a lot. i really like the overall construction of that set. the model is fairly lightweight but extremely sturdy. it must be one of the strongest large sets they've released. quote did you had something like this in mind? that's basically the idea. as blakbird said though, it wouldn't be very powerful and would put the axle under some stress. the linear actuators they're bringing out this year do the same thing and should work much better.

0 i'm very sorry for that doublepost... i made a picture for you, sinner, but forgot to upload it: your dad, patrick parrot, driving a giant backhoe. sadly his second job as photojournalist and the fact that bianca lamb was strolling by, distracted him. as a consequence he spoiled the whole construction site bringing death and doom with a technic backhoe to fabuland. and a little walrus baby. *y* :-p

1 a great review. i only have new sets, so looking at old ones like this is great. i would suggest multiple pictures blended together afterwards, instead of the long exposure pictures. bernddasbrot, on mar 23 2008, 11:32 pm, said: now you can recognize the backhoes real shape. only with a little violence its possible to lift the bonnet (?) through the pneumatic pump. aren't you supposed to fit the bonnet over the pump, and then attach it to the main frame ? front

1 this is a review of speed racer set 8159 raxer x vs taejo. this is my second review and the first review of this paticular set and the only one on eurobricks... at the moment x-d so without further ado i present to you my review... (i like that saying so much i decided to use it again in this review, it's originally from my review of 8158, which can be seen here.) note: sorry that this review got delayed, but there was a hostile takeover of the computer, x-o don't worry everythings fine now. x-d set: 8159 racer x vs taejo theme: speed racer price: $19.99us pieces: 237 minifigs: 2 note 2: i did not take photos of just the new pieces this time because they're the same "new" pieces as in 8158, just in diff. colors. if you want to see a picture of them click here. first off pictures of the box, instructions, dss, and minifigs: not quite as many stickers as set 8158, but there still are quite a few. can you guess which ones which? :-d yes, taejo's hair really is red and black, for racer x's head tlg just reused the baddie's head from 7620. |-/ now onto the build: first racer x's x racer :-d (thats not it's official name.. i think.) :-$ back end of the car. the cockpit, and yeah there are no seats for racer x's hiny, just a flat 2x2 dark bley plate. the cockpit and rearend of the car connect using an s-shaped connector piece. the front part of the car. the fornt and the cockpit are also connected using an s-shaped connector piece. adding some details including yellow fenders. the underside of the car, so far. adding some more detail. newly added motor vents and smooth details. adding a front bumper, amongst other things. side view of the car, so far.

(which are always good in a set.) it's only downfalls are the lack of acessories for the minifigs and that there are no cool contraptions on the cars, and by "cool" i mean lethal to the other racer(s). now to the scoring of the set: price:10/10 pieces: 8/10 too many stickers for such a small set. minifigs: 10/10 unique and creative. playability: 9/10 would have been perfect except for the lack of acessories and cool contraptions on the cars. (but both are easily modified/fixed hence the nine.) overall: 37/40 a great set! bonus: try and count how many times my silver pocket knife appears and win... the knowledge of knowing how many times the silver pocket knife appears. :-p :-d this concludes the review, more pictures of either set 8158 or 8159 or both available through request, via pm-ing me. ;-) see ya' next time folks... of course i don't mean that literally x-d ... general tarful edited by imperialshadows, 01 june 2008 - 12:05 pm.

1 wow! not as cool as the other set but awesome nonetheless...i can see that red car being a sportscar for city. and i hope that bruce wayne head does't become of liscened themes that the sunglasses face for city :-|

1 a very good review, thanks generaltarful. *y* thats an interesting set for sure, and especially the red car looks really fine. air intakes, very nice.... :'-)

0 speed racer go! >:-)

0 thanks for the review general tarful! i only saw the knife 27 times :'-( i like this set, but i probably won't justify the price, the other set has orange ( *wub*) and the mach 5, as well as better fleshie head i reckon. to the batbrick cave! >:-)

1 again, nice review! lego should have used this for their helmets, you can put a (protecting)glasses(don't know the name) in front of it: offcourse with a little 'm' printed on it.

0 generaltarful, on mar 25 2008, 01:43 pm, said: nope. :-p and thanks hollisbrick. they are both really similar so it really depends on which colors you use more in moc-ing, or which characters you like more. my personal choice is 8159 as it has cooler minifigs, except for racer x's recycled head :-|, and the colors are more useful to me. then again if you're like batbrick the only thing that matters is if a set has orange in it. :-p regards, general tarful thanks *y* probably will get this set although the orange..oh the orange peices 8-? haha anyway once again thanks for the reveiw, and meditate on the decision i will *yoda* x-d

0 thanks for the review. and for giving me directions :-p i think the design of these two cars looks to be better than in the other set. the drivers are positioned lower compared to the windscreen and the design of the front on th red car is really nice. i'm missing details of motors and cars this big could use a working steering mechanism.

1 speaking of pocket knives, i just got speed racer and snake oiler at k-mart and might mod the helmet so it actually looks like the cartoon. the problem is - i don't want to shell out two bucks for a clear visor! >:-( by the way, i know trans-clear visors are non-production, but where did they come from? a pick-a-brick? if so, what store? well at least if i do go through getting the elusive clear visor, it's not as bad as the insane $25+ red vader helmet! this set is great. i would have gotten this along with the one i purchased, but i didn't have enough dough with me to get both.

1 crap, now i want these sets!! great review!

1 very good review! these sets are a lot better than i expected, and for $20, i might have to pick up both! my family and i are going to orlando this summer, hopefully i'll pick these and some other sets up at the lego store in downtown disney. :-d

1 as promised, and with only a single day of delay is my review of the 2008 set: 4994 creator fierce creatures. this small set is the same size and price range as last year's 4939 cool cars reviewed by prateek and dillthepill. the box general info you get 193 pieces (vs 206 for cool cars) which is quite a lot, but most of them are small. there are a lot of hinges and some good slopes and wings. the building instructions contains three models, but no further ideas for inspiration. primary model: spider the first model is a big spider which shares some similarities to the secondary model of 4895 power in the design. the legs each have 3 joints, where the ones in the middle have "stud joints" to be moved sideways while the rest use hinges for all joints. there are 8 of them and it does get a little tedious with all the repetitive building in this relatively small model. i like the design of the face with a lot of eyes and a big and ugly mouth, but the real gem is the x-pattern on the opisthosoma made using double/inverted slopes. it is poseable and i think it looks more "fierce" when inverted. secondary model: snake the face of the snake is nicely detailed with a splitting tongue and a mouth than can move a little. there is a problem with the construction. it uses stacked hinges for some of the joints, which are hard to pull apart without stressing the pieces. tertiary model: fly i'm not completely sure what this insect is. i will say it's a fly, although the tail and head are too pointy. this is a neat little thing. conclusion primary model: 8 it is a good design, but lacks some sturdiness in the legs. they fall off a little too easily. secondary models: 6 they are pretty good when you look at the bricks that are available, but they don't wow you in any way and they suffer from the same issues as the primary model regarding sturdiness. alternate models: 3 it is hard to come up with alternate models with so many small pieces and plates that are only 1 stud wide. the colors might make you want to build a spyrius space ship. playability: 8 the models have many movable joints and you can put quite a scare into your minifigs when their town gets attacked by these creatures... unless some en forces are there to protect them. price: 6 creator sets are known for their great price to bricks ratio, but this set doesn't quite measure up to sets like cool cars. pieces: 7 the pieces aren't great by themselves, but who doesn't need a fist full of hinges, slopes and basic plates in standard colors? i don't think this is a must-have set like the big rig was last year. the pieces are great and it has a nice primary model, but the set lacks a bit when it comes to the usual strong creator qualities like alternate models and price.

1 enchanted island 6278 pictorial review original price: $66 pieces: 412 figures: 7 this 1994 set marked the beginning of a new era for lego pirates - it became a theme more centralised around playability and not so much grand ol' ships. 6278 enchanted island was the flagship set of the islanders subtheme, heavily based around polynesian and native american concepts (in fact, tlc was successfully sued by a number of tribes for using bastardised maori names, such as kahuka). it was released as a legend set in 2001, but due to poor sales was discontinued again. the largest of the islander sets, enchanted island is a portion of an island with a river running through. the left hand side features some sturdy buildings built into a tree-like structure on a rocky outcrop, whilst the left hand side features a tower built out of "wooden" posts and a large tribal statue. the box cover shows all the details; it does, however, differ from the instructions' finished product in that it has been more aesthetically arranged - bushes e.t.c. have been moved to fill in gaps and to not obscure other things. the sides of the box show nothing particularly special, although in one scene it depicts the islander canoe chasing the pirate boat with the treasure; just one way to play with the set. the back of the box, however, is superb, featuring a large number of alternative models: a toothy statue, a pirate tree (think wolfpack) with an islander base, kahuka's throne, a fire-breathing statue and a souped-up boat for the pirates. these, and many more, can be easily made because of the large diversity of pieces. the set has a huge number of minifigures for its size, the third highest number in the pirate range (the ses and the bsb being first and second, respectively) - a whopping 7! 5 islanders, including the all-too-common king kahuka, the elusive islander babe and 3 standard warriors - this set alone will never leave you short of enemies! 2 pirates, ironhook in his standard attire with a scurvy dog at his side attack the island, although they are only moderately armed - 2 cutlasses and a pistol between them; a musket would've been nice. the islanders, on the other hand, have 4 shields, a bow and quiver and 6 spears, not to mention the big pokey thing with horns on top (weapon? idol? staff?). a monkey, parrot and crocodile provide the obvious creature features, with a fair amount of gold to finish off. in the instructions, the goblet does not have the lid, although it does on the box; it's a nice touch anyway - adding a little more diversity to the monotonous treasure stashes. the pirates' boat is a nice 2 sail vessel, with oars for when the wind stops and a treasure map. the sails are similar to those in lagoon lockup, but with an extra front sail. it's an awesome little boat, better for raids than a rowing boat, but not too big that it can't sail up rivers. it can comfortably fit 2 men and, at a squeeze, 5. the sails are expensive if you buy them seperately; normally this won't be a problem, but they can cost aroun $5 each. the islanders' boat is a canoe with a sail and an outrigger to stabilise it. the sail is beautifully done, with 2 spars taughtening it. there is a clip for the rower to leave his weapon when at se and the mast can turn to get as much wind as possible. it's quite a top-heavy boat, but it doesn't look hideous and without the mast/sail it looks great. 3 islanders can fit in it, and more if they sit on the outrigger. the markings on the canoe are stickers, but they look fine and are probably more robust than markings for their job. furthermore, they're waterproof! *sing* kahuka's throne can be carried by 2 loyal subjects... ...or strapped to his pet crocodile! the clips on the side can be used to rest his weaponry, or hold spears for battle. the throne looks nice, although i'm not too sure about the blue against the red - i'd have prefered white as it would clash less... an overview of the island; it is built in 2 halves - left then right and then joined together loosley, so it can be seperated for transporting. around the back to the left and right, there are large open spaces that are great for battles - this set isn't so much about a large solid build, but creating a "village" - smaller structures linked by bridges. and the back... to the far left is a platform built onto the rock, with access from the river via a ladder. there's the standard islander drum with the lovely zebra-skin part (where did they get that?!). i've never understood the white flag - i was under the impression it was used for surrender... further along the rocky bank, there are some hinged palm leaves that swing upwards to reveal... ...the treasure! it's an ok hiding place; not the best place to hide it, right where the pirates sail past, but it feels fabulous; it fits right in. above it on the rocky bank is the main structure. it looks very disjointed when you build it (bricks all over the place), but once it's done it looks nice and rural, with leaves everywhere and the "balcony" where kahuka is standing. you get a nice roof made from 2 large palm leaves tilting down. around the back there's a slight shelter, a table for picnics and a ladder to access the upstairs. i was rather annoyed that it is so open, but the set is designed from just one perspective... to the left is the bridge to the other building... a nice, one piece bridge made of the softer plastic used for muskets and the post-1991 cutlasses. it looks good, but be warned! it tilts when you pull a pin, sending the pirates flying! this contraption is a good idea, but it is very stiff and so doesn't swing, even when burdened by a minifigure - you'll want to modify this bit if you get it. the other building looks like it is made out of posts and beams. they are all red; brown would have been better, but it would have added too many colours to the range, just like the use of black for trees in some forestmen sets. there are 3 clips for spare weapons; only 2 of these will ever be used when all the islanders are armed, but it gives the pirates scope once they've been disarmed...there's another nice palm tree roof on top. 2 ladders give access...there's a total of 4 in this set - worth getting, eh? although they're 5p on bricklink, for a kabob, they're like gold! at the top there's another hidey hole; the palm leaves lift up on hinges to show the treasure or hiding islander. it can be seen from behind, but this set is designed from one perspective only. nice cattlehorns too...alongside the slats you can see in the floor - 5 years later and it would've been a solid plate... the big statue is one of the main selling point of this set, alongside the tilting bridge - they're the action features shown in every catalogue at the time, but it is not really special, just original. the statue fits in with the theme perfectly - kahuka's mask, his shield and this statue all depict the same deity, which is a nice "collectible" idea. the back is rather plain, except the angled 1x1 bricks - a good touch. i'm not sure why there's a black brick in the back of the head, but this is easily remedied; it could even be done with a brick from this same set, just swapping the two over... aside from the head turning, the back can open to store sacred objects, or, in my opinion, prisoners, hence the gaps for breathing. either way, it's a lovely piece of architecture and deservedly a flagship element of the set. there's your standard cooking pot floating around, although a 1x1 yellow stud as human flesh (remember, minifigs are yellow, no matter what the licensed themes say!) is a superb finish. this set is a stunning set for both kids and afols who are just getting back into lego/pirates - it is a great army builder and, due to its release as a legend, is extremely cheap on ebay - you should be able to pick one up for 18, or 15 if you're lucky. for that you get a lifetime's supply of islanders, 4 ladders, some wall panels, 2 baseplates (one raised and both with rivers and printed vegetation around the edge), a ton of weapons, a fair quantity of standard bricks, but most of all, a heap of vegetation: this is an easy to buy set, with normally around 5 on ebay at any time, and is well worth it, for the parts, the play and the nostalgia! it can be easily modified; when used in conjunction with any other outpost, a much larger fortress can be made, especially if more rope bridges are used. if you pick 2 of this fine set off ebay (it'll still be less than the original price!), a huge complex can be constructed, giving you an instantaneous village for around 35. other information lugnet rating: 79/100 brickset rating: 4.3/5 bricklink price: new - $100 used - $54 edited by phred, 05 april 2015 - 08:04 pm.

1 excellent review! *y* getting a better chance to look at this set actually makes me interested in it. i was in my dark ages throughout the islander days, though i have built up a small force of them (10?) from ebay buys, but no actual sets. if this is really as reasonable as you say there, i may just have to pick one up soon. oddly, i do own the baseplates to this set, having also picked them up in a lot on ebay, so i might be able to recreate it manually, but i think i'd rather pick one up whole. it looks like a great mix of parts and makes a decent looking display piece. thanks again for the fine review! *y*

1 excellent review! i really like this set and so i gave it a 5/5. this set is on my list to get. i especially like the speedy pirate boat, and the also very fast outrigger canoe with a sail. i don't think a small number of these cannibals will make much of an impact on gaming though, even if they get a bonus with spears. duke

1 a mighty fine review you've created slyowl! *y* after some sleep i shall immerse myself more fully within it.

1 nice review ( although i'm pretty sure eldorado fortress has 8 minifigs, making this set no 4 in the minifig count.) i gave it a 5. the number of islanders and vegetation pieces comes in very handy for land based scenarios. i've got 3 copies of this set, 1 of them costing me less than 2euro's from an ebay auction in scotland. along with forbidden island it's easily one of the most common and affordable pirate sets to be found on he second hand market.

1 a great and informative review with very fine pictures, thanks slyowl! *sweet* a wonderful set this is indeed, full of nice details and pretty playable, and a cool subtheme that offers a lot of fantasy and charming characters in a marvelous layout. i really love that little boat with the outrigger, and the neat buildings and sweet landscaping works together very well. tlc got sued for using some names of native sounding origin? now that sounds really strange to me.... such namesre widely spread within novels, movies and such stuff, i didnt know that theres some kind of copyright on them.... 8-|

1 good review, mr. slyowl! and good pics too! i know it probably deserves better but i only give him a 3. i'll be surely the only saying that i don't like this set but i remember i had it for christmas when i was a child and it disappointed me very much because i expected it much larger after seeing it in the lego catalogs. well it's just a little trauma i had :-p lol anyway i must admit it's an interesant set, specially because of the large number of mini-figures and accesories it brings with and the two little "ships" edited by bluebard, 31 march 2008 - 01:13 am.

1 it's a great set and one i have yet to add to my collection despite my large number of islander extras. enchanted island, aside from having so alluring a name was good value for money in that you only needed this one set and you had a good representation of the islanders both in the size of the set and the number of minifigs. the flipping rope bridge and the river give it a great rainforest retreat sort of feeling and one is inclined to think of this set as more inland than directly coastal for me. whilst the islanders were never seen in the same light or popularity as pirates and imperials they were an obvious and colourful addition that to me added a whole new depth to the pirate system and one was now able to play a 3 or 4 way war adding a greater political element to the sets. enchanted island is probably the 3rd most appealing of the large land bases for me after port royal and eldorado fortress. good review and glad to see the set recognised!

1 slyowl, you're a legend! thank you for taking the time to do such a comprehensive review. you've captured enchanted island in impeccable detail and anyone who doesn't own this set should know it inside-out by now. i shall write my thoughts on the set itself, directly.

1 great review! i think this set looks great. i really like the islanders and that statue is really nice. it comes with a lot of nice leaves and i like all of the secret compartments and the like. thanks for the nice review!

1 thanks for the review! i am getting very interested in the classic pirates sets, and i wat some now. this seems like it would be a great starter.

1 i was just going into my dark ages when lego began the islander themes, so i've never really cared for them. but this review actually made me want this set real bad. i guess this is what reviews are for then - good job on the review

1 great review! i recently got this set for only 150 sek, around $17, and its really good!

0 everytime i saw this at a toy store i always cried to my parents for one, but never got it, i got the smaller islander sets, but the more i see this now, i don't want it, i could buy it, but naahh, i am hoping lego does an updated version of the islanders with this new pirates line, one can hope right!! xd

0 hello eldiano. although the review is fine and you have memories related to that set please have in mind that the post you were replying to was in fact some 7 years old. this is what we call "bumping of old topics" and it shouldn't be done. you might want to take a look at our faq: posting tips and etiquette edited by phred, 06 april 2015 - 03:47 am. by phred: read next post please.

1 eldiano, thank you for posting about your desire to have this set. i do own the set, and i do recommend it to others if they somehow find a used one. the bricks are kind of sparse, but the the bricks it does come with are really nice, i love the figs, and the base plates are by far my favorite made by tlg. captain braunsfeld, i suggest that you read through the link that covers topic bumping more clearly. i apologize for the confusion eldiano. i do believe that i have found a way to remove the confusion of posting in old topics soon among the pirate staff and to the other members of eb, please stay tuned. sinner, on 18 july 2010 - 03:16 am, said: 3. lego reviews don't date. thus if you have something relevant to say then feel free to post in a topic, but if it's more than a few months old please make sure it's good.... and if it's been a few years it better be really good! for example, if you liked the review or set and want to say so you probably shouldn't. if you've got an answer to a question (such as "does anyone have pictures of the alternate model?) then by all means post! what you shouldn't do is ask questions to the original poster; he/she may not even visit eb any more.

1 fortunately i got this set on 2000 (not the released version, the original one). and i said "fortunately" because it's a lovely set. how could i rate it, but awesome? a little islander "army", the islander girl, ironhook and that cool boat with two sails, the jail-polynesian statue. i must recognize that i have a thing with the islanders. i know that they are weird, poorly based on the polynesian aborigens, etc. but they are very original, broke with the traditional enemies, and gave to the pirates theme an exotic and wild look.

1 what an amazing (old) set! i loved pirates in my childhood, but that was before the islander and spanish stuff... mine were the bsb and soldier fortress with the big baseplate. as i'm now returning to pirates, i've tracked down most of the 2009 sets and of course bought the new 2015 sets... but knowing i missed this "middle" period of islanders vs pirates makes me a bit sad... those islanders are soooo "monkey island" (those of my age likely feel the same) to my eyes! oh for a "lemonhead" minfig... ;) i'm curious now how much this set sells for, given it was apparently one of very few lego actually re-released! i recently bought a misb bsb that was an early 2000's re-release, and it was very pricey... but then, i suspect the bsb has a lot more of a nostalgic following these days than this set! can anyone give me a rough idea what this set goes for in as-new condition these days? regardless, a fantastic review with some great photos of the whole set and minifigs... even though this is an old thread, i am glad someone else bumped it recently so i can add my thoughts too. :) one thing i've noticed comparing the newest pirates sets to the 80's ones i had as a kid (and these from the 90's) is the move away from baseplates and big "panel" pieces. i actually like that in a lot of ways; whilst i miss baseplates being included as they are a great starting point for creating new things (and make the sets easier to "play" with), visually, i think lego-designed model sets look better without them.

0 here is a preview of my review of speed racer: grand prix race i will try to get a full review up later today pics (when public) sorry about the blur, i am not a great photographer. also if, there are any pictures you would like (that i haven't included), just ask

1 no problem casewindu! i actually like this set for the pieces and torsos (especially sprittle's)

-1 joey lock, on mar 29 2008, 07:13 pm, said: how comes the monkey stays yellow but not the people... :'-( it's a liscensed theme, so they are tan. where are these sets coming from? none appeal to me though. oh, and nice review! edited by ~vbbn~, 29 march 2008 - 11:43 pm.

1 i will most likely get all the speed racer sets as it was one of my favorite movies(the animated one) i just loved the decked up and tricked out cars >:-) great review and red tux = x-d

1 looks like a great ole set to me. the cars seem abit overly slopey to me though, i'll probably pass on this. but as a note, i especially like the black and yellow car's horizontal wheel covering things. nice :-$

1 again, no problem! personally i would have liked a lower price ($96.04 cad with tax *n* ) also my favourite would be the gray and black car!

-1 doubt ill get this, i used to like the anime but the the film looks cheesy as a cheese sandwhich

0 sorry to bump such an old thread, but ive just discovered this set is on sale at amazon.de - for a mere 25 euros. i am tempted. not because i like the set or the models, but because of the parts. as most of you might know, im especially into exo-force. so would you recommend to get this set just for the parts? are they a good choice to combine with ef-sets? would anyone of you be interested in obtaining the fleshie-parts of the minifigs from me, as i totally dont need those?

1 i picked up this set a few weeks ago (along with the smaller sets that come with the mach 5 and racer x's car), and i was pleasantly surprised. the commentator's stand is nothing to write home about, but the assortment of figs is great (numerous new face prints in flesh, i believe), and in spite of the large amount of stickers, the three cars are each unique and very well-designed. my only gripe about them is that cannonball taylor's car (the black and yellow one) was a missed opportunity, as in the movie it's yellow and purple. i know tlc is dropping purple for the future and had a bunch of problems with it in the past, but it would have made for a great looking car imo.

0 well...... thanks for your posting, but i couldnt care less about fleshie minifigs or movie-accurate cars - or the cars at all. this set would really only go into my parts bin. therefore i need to know what parts are in there and if they are "cool" enough to go into an exo-force collectors parts bin.

0 an opportunity has come up to buy this set for 100 aud. just wondering whether people think it's worth buying? i've heard very little about the speed racer legos

1 speed racer is the action film.and he has formula 1 car but he is intersted in art of the race.

0 i'm in the same situation as you; i have this set but missed out on the newer 8421. this was a great set for its time but the 8421 definitely looks better to me. i've been trying to find a good deal on it on ebay but it's pretty expensive, considering that it only went out of production last year. quote inlay: i wonder why tlg doesnt make inlays anymore theyre noisy and brake easily but are great for (pre-) sorting. the box designs in general are crappier these days than they used to be 10 years ago. you don't see the old "featured parts" trays anymore and the boxes don't have the different sections either (these also acted as internal supports for larger boxes, so they were less prone to being crushed). the cardboard material is also quite a bit thinner. i think it's a result of tlc's overall cost-cutting moves since then. most people toss the boxes and probably don't care, but i keep all of them. there was actually a time when the boxes used to be even stronger. i have an old 8859 set and the outer box is made of a hard, styrofoam material, although they probably stopped using that for environmental reasons. edited by cp5670, 06 april 2008 - 10:13 pm.

1 a great review, thank you. i do not know these old sets like this one, but it is very cool to see how they were made. i have an un-opened 8421, maybe i should do a small review of that when i get to build it. btw. boxes are expensive, so at a given price point, it's a choise between more bricks or nicer boxes. i have no doubt what most people would chose. front edited by front, 06 april 2008 - 10:21 pm.

1 thanks for the review. *sweet* for it's size and parts count this is a remarkably featured set. i don't think i've never seen the alternate model before. personally i prefer 8421 because i think it looks much better and i love the six wheel steering. i also love the three segment boom and the transmission; they fit it all in so neatly. i realise that it has trouble even holding up itself, but ultimately it doesn't matter as it's not like you are really going to construction work with it. what bothers me more about 8421 is the design change in the boom from chainlinks to strings. i would try to mod mine but all i have is the prototype picture to base it on... and i don't have enough links anyway! :-p bernddasbrot, on apr 7 2008, 07:29 am, said: yeah, somehow i wonderd why only vbbn (thanks!) responded... indeed! i have been very busy the last few months and i kept meaning to reply... at last i managed to find the time to reply today. bernddasbrot, on apr 7 2008, 07:29 am, said: another reason for the 8460 as favorite set? it's got a "real" alternate model, not just a different erm- crane. yes, that really sucks. somebody (i haven't got the time to look :-$) on brickshelf has made a quite good alternate. lego have been a bit inconsistant with alternate models lately. the recent tow truck had a good one; i even made both!

1 great review! while i admit i wasn't into technic at the time this came out (i was a mere child, give me a break! :-d), i can see now why it was featured so much. from the booklets to display stands at toy stores and at my local lego center (when it was still around), this thing was everywhere! with your review, i can now truly appreciate all the details of the set. i got to admit, i can see the appeal now! that comparison shot you took is amazing. i love not only just how it included the little details such as the stabilizers, but also looks incredibly fun to play around with. great set and an even greater review!

0 thanks guys! @ sinner: i hope you refered to 8285 so my answer will match: 8285 is interesting: main model: american styled truck, alternate model: european styled truck. i don't think tlg produced many european styled truck. edit: i just found a wonderful moc-alternate on brickshelf: 8436 by industrialdesigner. if i got him right, he designed a few offical technic sets for tlg. @ all: promises, promises, promises... hm. and again it's ebay that's blocking me. i want to foreshadow my next review (although it'll take some time to make it): i know, you know. but please act inconspicuous until you'll can act very astonished...! edited by bernddasbrot, 09 april 2008 - 03:25 pm.

1 actually they are ants. spiders have 8 legs while ants have only 6 like these. the two thing that look like legs in the front are the antennae. back on topic, i think this set looks great and i can't wait until i can get my hands on it and the other new ij sets. edited by erdbeereis1, 15 april 2008 - 09:26 pm.

1 the rancor, on apr 15 2008, 10:11 pm, said: i'm pretty sure those 'ants' are actually spiders. i thought they were spiders before, but when i saw them mentioned as ants, i realised that they are definately ants! being a big ant fan, i recognise that they are not spiders - they look like ants too, and they could be lifesize to some larger species. yay ants! and new hairpieces! and accessories!

-1 the new man hair looks like a wig!

1 thanks for the review! must...make...ant...army...

1 another great review alex. is that the same tent/construction as the tent in 5978, sphinx secret surprise?

1 i'd buy a bunch of these just for the ants to make an ant farm! i also like the bowl cut.

1 i love this set! thanks for the reveiw!!! probably the only indy 4 set i'll get..

1 front, on apr 16 2008, 10:15 am, said: they must be ants, but i'm pretty convinced that what you think are the antennae, are the ants mandibles. or not. there are six legs, 2 antennae, and 2 mandible. and they most definately are ants, to those still in doubt. thanks for this great review, alex, this is most definately (well, in my opinion anyway) the best set. lets face it, in motorcycle chase you really only got 2 bikes and 2 crates as the big parts of the set. in this one, which is the same price, you get those ants, a neat tent (hurray!), a [b]printed[/i] map, a chicken leg, a castle sword, ef sword, and pirates sword, a dagger (now in light bley) and a silver frying pan. this set is packed with useful pieces, i'm definately getting this one. and i for one love mutt's hair piece. i sense my sig-fig will soon have a new hair style. thanks again alex for the sweet review! ~peace edited by iamded, 16 april 2008 - 05:07 am.

1 i was already thinking of buying this set, and you've totally convinced me. thanks for the review, alex btw, i think they are ants, having that shape; moreover, we already have spider molds, and they have already been used in theatre themes (see spiderman ). luxorv

1 ok! i think, it''s a no-brainer that this is a must-have for pretty much anyone who likes lego! it's cheap and a great minifigs & parts pack! i'll be getting at least 1 of these! here is what i like about it: 1. great minifigs with nice torsos, sweet faces, and awesome hair! (gotta ask 'em where they get it done! ) 2. golden katana! 3. chicken leg! yum! 4. nice campfire! and this is what i don't like about it: 1. dark bley knife! seriously, they could have at least made it silver like the sword, if not chrome! 2. rehashed tent. 3. spiders with 6 legs!!! i actually don't really care about the tent and the multi-legged creatures. those go straight into the sorting boxes. perhaps i might use the tent someday for a steampunk moc of some kind, or a stop-motion film, or maybe some kind of contest... anyway, what's up with that thing that holds the katana, the sword, and the saber? it's in the airplane set too! is it perhaps one of the treasures of the new movie or is it something indy takes with him everywhere in this film? 44however, nice pics, nice review! thanks, dude! edited by oky wan kenobi, 16 april 2008 - 09:38 am.

1 mhm...i really need this set! there are various things im interested in: the minifigs (hey, i still have no indiana jones figs!), the new hairpieces, a gold katana, a dark bley pirate cutlass (is this the first one?), a dark bley knife (could be useful..), those giant ants, yet another silver broad sword (you never have enough of those).....great parts pack indeed. shakar

1 great review

1 nice review indeed thanks for review all these new indianna sets just wondering did your set have a crate as im sure the prims has a crat with a banana in.

1 thanks for that great review! this is a very interesting set filled with nice parts for customisation. somemore, the price is not that steep. i will need to get ready for the second wave!

1 set ref: 7625 name: river chase number of minifigs: 4 number of pieces: unknown price: 22,90 a general view of the set: weve got an amphibious vehicle, a small boat, an observation post and a dark green croco (so beautiful! ). for the figs, weve got indy of course, marion and two russian soldiers, nothing special here. in the back of the tree, there is a box, to put some things: the amphibious vehicle is very nice! the proportions are really great (not too big, not too small) and there are a lot of details everywhere, like the propeller: a back view: an inside view: the small boat is a dark grey zodiac, but the details are nice too, giving it a retro look, in the same way of all the indy vehicles: the outpost has a net to permit to the bad guys to capture some nice guys and girls but it seems that the girl marion is scared of the nice croco! so indy comes and help her pushing the technic axle with this round inversed tiles, which push out the net and capture the croco. now marion feels happier! and she takes a can of oil and whacks the poor croco, without defences! who has said marion is a nice girl? so, ive bought this set like an add on to my city. in fact, the elements of this set can easily be integrated in a town layout. i plan to use the outpost for my forest section, and the amphibious vehicle is always a nice touch of originality in a layout. yes you can use all those military things without creating an army in a layout: just put the violent parts out, and youve got nice things, like a biologist car in the case of the amphibious vehicle!

1 great set, i'll definitely get it. is there any sign of flesh on the soldiers, like at the collars?

1 is that a laptop it's on? does it come with the set? seriously though, it looks liek it has some good pieces, particularily the soldier's clothing and the crocodile hehe. hooray for new indy sets, lets hope the film is as good (it will be).

1 nice review, i like what i'm seeing in this set. i liked the little comic, marion should be arrested though

1 quote set ref: 7625 name: river chase i swear it is supposed to have stickers on the side of the car, boat, oil canister and windscreen? i like this set, looks brill!

1 wow, this is a fantastic set, i love the dark green croc and other features. marion is good to have again and i love her new torso, and those commies look great as well. thanks for the review alex54. batbrick away!

1 what are those bricks with the guns attached supposed to be? great review and set btw...

1 my favorite part of this is prob the amphibious vehicle! looks really neat! nice to see another (different) torso for marion...

0 hmm i'm debating whether i should get this set..great reveiw btw. i love that dark green croc

1 sweet review again, alex! great pictures, i loved the little comic with the croc. you're quite right here too: alex54, on apr 16 2008, 09:17 am, said: yes you can use all those military things without creating an army in a layout: just put the violent parts out, and youve got nice things, like a biologist car in the case of the amphibious vehicle! without the gun, that vehicle is a nice little amphibious car with a tent (i assume) strapped to it, some tools, a spare tire... the little tree hut is quite cool, and a nice touch with the box in behind there. i love the design for those gasoline cans too. thanks again, alex! you're lucky to be getting these sets! ~peace

1 thanks for the review! i really like this little-ish set, quite alot of detail, it reminds me of sets from the late 90's more soviets are always welcome too, and the new torso for marion is nice, as is the new dark green alligator all of the neat little accesories are great too, a cup, shovel, binoculars and of course the cans of gasoline again, thanks for the review, alex

1 great review alex after seeing these pics i'm really looking forward to getting this set, i really like how lego has designed the gas tank that's just so good. finally a different shade of green for the croc, it's about time and more than welcome. the vehicle looks good and a fun build, though i'm not that fond of that commie tree

1 good

1 a very fine review of a really great set, thanks alex! this set has everything, a croc, very nice mfs, a neat tree trap, a cool zodiac and a marvelous and very detailed amphibious car in a beautiful color scheme. the only thing im not colpletely sure is the design of that jerrycan (thanks for the right word and the interesting link, kingboy ). although the use of the revolvers pretty clever indeed and fits well too, its still clearly, well, a revolver.... very unusual and interesting for an official tlc design.

1 this set looks good. about the jerry cans, i like how they give me more pistols. this may be the only indy set i get from this batch. i'll just have to deal with the fleshie heads... (exchange them for yellow.) like stealth hunter said. this will be good for army building. silent help

0 im glad they change the torso form the prototype

0 i cant wait for these!

1 oh, man, thanks for the review! imo, this looks like the best set in the new indy line! do you have any better pics of the colonel?

1 great review, thanks for that. i love almost everything about this set. the ants, commies, general (can we please get a shot of his face?), dark green, treads, foliage and other creatures. great stuff, i'll have to get it on sale though. batbrick away!

1 this is a great set!!!!!! it is probably my favourite indy so so far! great reveiw! although the set is great the price is greater have to get it on sale..

1 wow in the protype pics i kept thinking this thing looked lame; a boat on treads with saw blades? but this is definetly something i want now. lots of great plant and animal parts. and looks like plenty of wheels with those treads; its just begging to be made into a propor tank.

1 this one is my favorite from the bunch. thanks for the time spent in making a review

1 great review, thanks a lot for all the pics. i agree that this is probably the nicest set of the indy 4 wave. so much dark green and i love all the plant pieces. it's been ages since we've had enough pieces in a regular release to build nice forests so it's great to see 11 of the dark green leaves in one set and all the vines! the design of the cutter looks very solid and brick built as well. giant ants are great looking too.

1 a great, detailed review for an excellent set! i love the jungle cutter vehicle itself, and all the dark green! it's great to have the trees and cave entrance; you can never have enough extras! the figs are nice too; two russian soldiers, the cool-looking general (i think his name is dovchenko or something) and the repeated-but-still-nice indy with rpg. thanks again, looks like i'll be picking this up along with jungle duel. (by the way, i think this set is called jungle cutter).

0 wow those trees look so weak compared to those enormous blades. anyway, a high-possibility-and-appeal-to-us-compulsive-lego-shoppers set, so, i'll try to get it, which means i'll obsesively look until i find. deforestation of puny trees, on!

1 thanks for the review alex i agree that this is the best set of kotcs sets (although the airplane comes quite close..). although i'm not too fond of the trees, the cave is good, and the jungle cutter is brilliant. plenty of great features, and very detailed, with much of the engine showing and a decent cockpit (if that's the right word..). the general and the two soviets are great too (could we have a close-up pic of them please? ), good to see that neither torso has exposed fleshy skin like the nazis. as said though, it is quite a pricy set, i was expecting it to be just over the price of race for the stolen treasure. great set, thanks again, alex!

0 here some close-up pics of the russian soldiers and the general : and i know that you have seen that i don't have put the stickers on...

1 great review again alex !! same question (in case you didn't se it in my reply to the other set): where did you get those new sets ?? i really love that set !! its called jungle cutter the trees are really cool and make a great adition to it imo. that temple entrance or monument is really cool !! those bionicle parts do make fantastic vegetation !! i totally forgot about that green frog !! thats cool , those are so cute !! 5 more ants is great !! the vehicle look really sharp (ah ah ah). 2 more commies yeay !! that officer is really freaky actually !! could have been a high rank under pol pot's regime in the s21... yeay looks more asian than russian imo now its time for my grips: * same bloody rant about indy !! * i haven't read the instructions before but once again there are so many parts in crap colours that need to be changed look at all the crap red and yellow in there !! i will need to look for those parts before buying the set like i always do !! mod while building on !! i am really soimpressed with that indy line !! i sincerely hope it will have a long and healthy life !!

1 what a lovely set! i think i have to put this on my wishlist,just for that beautiful woodcutting tank thingie. 2008 is gonna get expensive for me

0 the thing and the set is called jungle cutter and the reason the front pops off is because indy blows it up with a bazooka incase you wanted to know. thanks for the nice review

1 this is the 3rd review, that i had read. it's very tempting to fly over and get those sets from there. because, i may need to wait for some months before it arrived. it seemed we will have a new small little creature to add into the ranks. these "red ants" is cute and of course looks nasty too. haha. i love those trees, foilage and plants very very much. it can be used for my moc and is good for any "green" project related expansion. i love it. about the vehicle, i find it abit wierd. it seemed too big in the set-up. hehe, but still i love this set. mainly, i will get it for the green parts

1 this is around the time that many consider the decline of castle, in which point i somewhat agree, but admittedly it still looks like a very playable set, and the tree is very well done. thank you for the review!

1 thanks every much for the review! i remember having this set, and making really terrible stop-motion movies with it. very playable. this brings back lot's of fond memories! thanks! majisto on!

0 ah, the wonderful dragon knight (or was it dragon masters?) sets. i personally preferred the black knights, but these guys still had some awesome sets! thanks for this review, this looks like a neat little set, although those modern stairs look a little out of place. that tree design is indeed a neat one, i remember having that in one dark forestmen set i got. the interior sure is roomy. may i suggest for future review you photograph the set on a cleared table, that way you won't get distracted by the clutter in the background and can focus on the main part of the image, the set. ~peace

1 this is probably one of my favourite sets and/or one of the sets which i wish i owned..the 90's was probably my favourite castle era! tobad i was to young to buy this set when it came out man i wish i had one of those dragons, they were one of the best type i reckon although all the dragon's are good thanks for the reveiw edited by hollisbrick, 16 april 2008 - 07:41 am.

1 yay, go dragon masters! i have to agree with iamded, i do like the black knights sets better for their design ( betrayal! ), however, the dragon knights are just awesome, 'cause they have dragons! this is a nice set, with some awesome minifigs and a nice overall design. i wish i had it... go masters!

1 agent rick: you're definately the dragon master around these parts. what a great little set. i really like the classic dragon which reminds me of a similar style used for the lego crocodiles. and the dungeon is pretty slick too. i like the use of the large gates plus the doors. plus the set contains the blue wizard. awesome! great review.

1 a very neat set with charming mfs and a great classic dragon, a good use of burps and a really nice tree indeed. thanks for the review, agentrick57!

1 this was the last castle set i got before my dark age.. really liked it although the big rock parts looked really bad ( i am kind of used to them now) unfortunately i lost the little wand.. and i never understood who is "good" and who is "bad" does the wizard own the dragon? well they dont seem to be enemies but isnt the dragon supposed to be evil??

1 the 8291 dirt bike comes from a long line of technic bikes, and i think it's the best ever. it looks great, and it's fun to ride around in the house. i hoped to find a figure the right size for it, but none of mine would fit. unlike a lot of technic models, it looks good from all angles. considering the size of the model it has a complicated way of connecting the engine to the wheel. the rear shocks are just the right stiffness... ...and they have a good amount of travel. i thought these shocks were new. i need to get out more... functions: shocks: two front, one stiffer one in the rear. drivetrain: 2 piston engine linked to the rear wheel via gears and a chainlink. steering: yes it does... stand: retractable. for the price, size and subject, what else could be added? 10/10 parts: considering that it has three shocks and a 40 chainlinks it's a great set for parts. some hard to use large parts are included, but they are not overused. the usage of the green does limit part usage somewhat though, and i'll be struggling to find a use for those wheels for anything other than a motorbike. 8/10 price: at $39.99 aud for 248 parts it isn't the best value set. the us price is $25.00 which is somewhat better. it does have some more complicated parts however. 7/10 looks: lego seems to be moving away from the see-though look for technic sets and this is a good example of it. i'm not a big fan of fairings but i think they work great in this set as a fuel tank. 8/10 fudge: this set was great for me as i have never had a technic bike. however for those that want this for just parts or have other bikes it could be a hard sell. the alternate model (a chopper) is a complete rebuild (which i didn't make), and it's great that lego have been including these most of the time lately. 7/10 overall: recommended. 8/10

1 i think the green motocross bike looks great. i like the use of fairings on this bike. the only thing i really don't like about the technics bikes in general, is the "clumsy" design of the chaindrive. it sticks way to much out to the side. if they made a really big bike model, it would be more in place with this chain drive. i'm not sure if it wouldn't be possible to design a shaft drive to the rear wheel, ala bmw style. but the green "kawasaki" look great with the front and rear suspension. i have the street bike, 8420, a somewhat larger and more complicated set, and will probably add the motocross bike to my collection soon. it would be great if lego could make a line of bikes, like they do the ferrari line. front

0 thanks for the great review sinner i like the technic bikes i wonder how it would look if you replaced the gear on the back wheel with a smaller one?

1 i have just finished building this set. i was a bit disappointed with the amount of bricks when they were out on my table, but the final model is really nice and totally makes up for that. i like the small details like on the handles and fuel tank and the only real negative thing i can say is that the cog seems a bit oversized in the rear. i don't know if the designer frequents this forum, but i'm sure he will be happy about how much you like it - it took quite some time/prototypes to get to this design: (sorry about the size of the picture - it isn't mine)

0 best review of a lime green technic dirt bike ever! really, it is. i just don't understand the allure of the bike very much. where does the fabuland fig go? anyway, very insightful review. thanks for taking the time and effort to review it for us. i'm not really interested in the set, but wanted to support my buddy since i know how much work you put into these. now i shall go read the cherry picker one. i look forward to it because there's a walrus in it. lasse d, on apr 22 2008, 04:55 pm, said: it must be cold in that room. nice shirt, but the vertical hold is broken...

0 simonwillems, on may 17 2008, 06:30 pm, said: how did i manage to miss this review? i must have overlooked it somehow... you must have been ignoring me! it's been in my signature for weeks! simonwillems, on may 17 2008, 06:30 pm, said: it looks a lot like an upgraded version of one of the first bikes lego made, namely the 8838 shock cycle. i also believe the back gearwheel is somewhat oversized, it looks better with the smaller one you attached. yes, it does seem to be a remake. the shock cycle even has a dangly chain like my modded version... as a set i'd prefer the old one due to the four indentical springs.

1 i wasn't very interested in this set at first. it seemed to be just a nice looking truck with a small motor... but when i found out it had a transmission i changed my mind! here is the transmission. it allows the single motor to be used for two functions. this system has been around for a while, and lego seem to be using it more and more. the transmission driving ring alone (the red circle) goes for $5-15 usd on bricklink, and you also need the catch and clutch gear so i have been buying sets that have them instead. i now have enough parts to make a supercar gearbox. (i bet a new supercar comes out next year now...) this is the gear that rotates the arm. note the colour of the 24 tooth gear; it seems to be a new gear trend. a lot of work has been put into this truck looking real. personally i think they went too far as the truck seems to have been designed for a tilting cab, but it's disabled to prevent breaking the front. bottom of the transmission. the bottom shaft lifts the arm. note that there are more dark grey gears. the motor fits in very well also. the bottom of the arm. i was surprised by the usage of a 12 tooth bevel to link with the 36 tooth double bevel as i had never seen that done before. as you can see there is no room for any drive train. standard steering for a recent technic truck. there is a hand-of-god at the cab top that links via two knob wheels. it looks good from the back. you can also see the white clutch that connects the transmission to the motor to avoid burnouts. it goes decently high, and can go a bit higher if you use the crane arm. compared to last years fire truck. (if i didn't buy the fire truck for half price i would have been annoyed that lego brought out what is almost a motorised version of the same set.) functions: cherry picker arm: motorised rotate and lift that links to a motor via a transmission and anti-burnout clutch. steering: rack and pinion controlled via a hand-of-god linked by knob wheels doors: open and close. good functionality that works well, but i wish they made the cab lift and i'm a bit sick of the lame fairing door trick. 7/10 parts: motor, battery box, transmission, clutch, practical wheels, only two fairings, compact turntable... this is a great parts set. 10/10 price: at $99.99 aud for 726 parts it's ok value when you consider what you are getting. the us price is $60.00 which is better, but still not great. i bought mine for $80 aud which was good however, and i suspect that the price is designed for easy sale...8/10 looks: i'd buy this for the looks alone! 9/10 fudge: the functions work well and i llked it more than i thought i would. oddly mine seemed to be missing a axle pin with friction, but since it includes extra parts for the alternate model i didn't mind using one of my spares. on the subject of the alternate model, it is a dump truck which is made out to be a total re-build, but it isn't. it could have easily been done like super street sensation was, but lego have probably determined that instructions like that confuse people. 8/10 overall: recommended. 8/10

1 thank you for that fine review of a pretty cool and nice set with a very good amount of functionality and, um, playability, for sure.

-1 great review sinner i bought this set a few weeks ago personally i prefer the alternative model of the flatbed truck.

0 thank you for your detailed review, sinner! im not that much into technic building because im lacking the inspiration to build something different with all those technic elements. so ill pass on this one and stay to classic bricks.

0 thanks for the review! i think i am going to get this set for it's many technic pieces. i could really use those for a rig i'm going to build.

0 looks like an interesting set. i didn't realize the motor controlled two functions through a transmission switch. that's always good to see. i'll probably pass it up though until the price falls a bit. the overall design is a bit too studless for my liking (i think the 8275 bulldozer has a much better balance of studded and studless pieces), and the wheels somehow look too small to me. i also have something of a backlog at the moment; i still need to pick up that bulldozer along with the 8421 mobile crane (on ebay).

1 sinner, on apr 22 2008, 08:49 pm, said: i didn't know you liked technic. i look forward to seeing this rig. well, it's mostly from the "mindstorms" robotics side.... honestly, if i bought this, it would be my first technic set ever

1 svelte_corps, on apr 30 2008, 10:44 pm, said: and what everyone's been waiting for, the skullies - three of 'em and a conquistador skellie - very cute. note the backs of the crystal head have a plume-sized hole - or maybe that's just where they injected the blue brain-plastic. spooky! i love these skulls, i wasn't sold from the initial pics but they have a very creepy smile and the head shape is just... weird. with the large eyes, it's kind of homer simpson-esque. they reminded me more of the movie "coneheads", but i think your description is more accurate. looking forward to the rest of the review!

1 the figs look great! the natives and the skeleton conquistador are my favorite figures in the set. the set itself is very good. the interior sort of reminds me of an older style lego set for some reason. it could be just me, but it has a classic feel. this will a great set to add to my list! great review! (so far, anyway. i only saw the back of the box!) edited by general zen, 01 may 2008 - 02:17 am.

0 tinypiesrus, on may 1 2008, 12:18 pm, said: i was really hoping that the conquistador helmet would end up being silver in the final set, but i suppose it's good to know that the helmet is being porduced again anyway. and is the armour the skellie is wearing pearl gold? hi tinypiesrus - i love that helmet too! if only we had plumes again... soon hopefully! the armour is pearl silver, not gold.

1 looks great! i cant't wait until i can get my hands on this and the other new ij sets. this is turning out to be a really good theme! i'm really liking the crystal skulls and i also think the baseplate looks very nice. those natives look fantastic in my opinion. thanks for the great review! edited by erdbeereis1, 01 may 2008 - 02:53 am.

0 brilliant review, and great pics. thanks. hmmmmm i would actually like one of these now, where before i was unsure.

-1 thanks for the great review, svelte_corps. i've been wanting to see this set in detail since it debuted at the conventions. i have to say that, on the one hand, i agree that the minifigures, the crystal skulls, and the colors are great (i even like the waterfall), but, on the other, i kind of think that the set itself is a disappointment. it looks like they tried to accommodate design and playability needs, but really didn't come through on either. so, as you pointed out, the mid section doesn't really fit in with the other parts, and the trap sequence doesn't really flow, either. but, perhaps your right, and all will be answered in the film. i was surprised at just how empty the temple looked in the photo taken from above. they really should have gone the extra mile and made the temple look more like a temple, and not worry so much about the action features. eh, but so it goes. but, i, too, am a sucker for tombs and temples, so i won't be able to pass it up. archaeology on!

1 thanks svelte_corps for the great review, if it's out in aussie then it should hopefully be reaching nz soon. i can't wait! this looks like a great set, for me at least. i too am a great fan of spooky old temples, they are such fun. i love the look of the base plate, but the stickers don't look all that great. i wish they printed it like they always used too. i have to get this set. and the other ones too. thanks again, you have brightened this sad day.

1 outstanding review! your efforts have totally convinced me to get this set no matter what! it really looks very great and funz reading that review. i will be looking forward to the new addition of those mini-figs. just love the layout of this temple. a great addition indeed

0 thanks for the reveiw it was a enjoyable and good one! i really like this set!!! too bad it's beyond my price range, i guess i'll just get the smaler set. what suprised me is that there is no giant ants i'm guessing you live in aus.? where did you get this set from???

1 i was going to review this on monday but my camera ran out of batteries! anyways, great review! as i have the set built, it's a really fantastic set. the waterfall is a reall cool sticker, and the flick fire missiles are quite interesting. another point of interest: there are seven of the new flick fire missiles overall, if anyone cares.

0 nice review, and your cat looks exactly like ours! shame yoda ain't around to review anymore, though... *m'aiq runs off to the nearest tavern to drink* away all thoughts of parson yoda yoda* *"i don't know how to get drunk off soda, but it's possible!" -me

0 great~!! your cat is soooooo cute~

0 thank you for the nice review. off-topic: i heard something on lowlug that tlc cancelled 2624 (little set with indy, mutt, irina and tent). have anybody heard something about that? that would be not so nice.

1 svelte_corps, on may 1 2008, 02:44 am, said: (e) central turret thing this thing is kind of annoying and doesn't really sit or work well. it's kind of like a laser beam sending messages to space, i guess. as the central dome rises, the two plates peel away. i find it is a little bit tight to work smoothly and the two plates doesn't really sit well together at the top. maybe i just need to rebuild it. i'm sure this will also be explained in the movie. great review! now i'm really truly convinced that i'm gonna buy this set. my faith was a little wobbly, but its benn restored anyway, i just wanted to point out that the temple's entrance might actually be the turret thing. if you watch the teaser, there are some very similair stone pillars surrounded by sand (there are 4 not 2 though ) and when they close up it looks like all our characters are sucked into the sand and magically appear underground going through some stone plates(which act like steps to go down) that dissapear. so, in theory those steps beneath the turret are actualy the entrance, and i'm asumming from this picture that the steps with 1x8 bricks with the dragon heads at the end lead us of somewhere else. all in all this temple looks like a mixed up version of the real temple, which is fine by me (sidenote: i'm not sure but based on minifig inclusion, either lego was cheap or colonel dovchenko is dead by the time irina and her goons reach the temple, i'll wait till i see the movie. ) edited by belloq, 02 may 2008 - 02:14 am.

0 trooperdavinfelth, on may 1 2008, 05:06 pm, said: absolute hogwash. i wouldn't trust anyone on a forum i've never heard of. i don't believe they'd cancel it. it's still on s@h, right? well, the people there are quite trustfull. but i looked now on shop@home and 7624 (i posted the wrong number, sorry) is only available in canada and the united states, so i hope it's not an exclusive.

0 that's awesome!!! i'm going to my local tru today to see if i can find the two smaller sets.

-1 the architecture/aesthetic design looks like a twelve year old's modification of the real set. the parts look good though. steve

1 nice review! got this set yesterday and u have to say, that amphibious vehicle rocks!!!

0 great review, thanks! as i thought, amazon did send out my pre-ordered sets not until yesterday evening, so i should receive them (hopefully) on monday or tuesday. can't wait for them! btw., i wonder what's up with all these sticker leftovers in the indy sets..this hasn't been the case in any other set with stickers, right? edited by metalandi, 03 may 2008 - 01:56 pm.

0 i brought this set a few days ago and agree with everything you say. i would have never noticed that the boat sticker is the set number unless you pointed it out. glad to see that one set of fuel can stickers was extra, i spent ages looking for a place to put them. cool review btw

0 good,thorough review. some of the pictures were a bit blurry though.

1 thank you for the nice, in-depth review! i have to say, lego did a good job on the amphibious vehicle. p.s.- if you need photo taking help, pm me and i can give you some handy tips.

1 very good for a first review! i bought this set and jungle duel at target the other day (i was going to wait and buy them when i go to downtown disney this summer, but how could i pass up saving four bucks that i can spend on store-exclusives? ) and i have to say i absolutely love them. the amphibious vehicle (don't they call it a duck in the movie?) is definitely my favorite lego vehicle i've ever built. everything about it is wonderful- the size, the colour scheme, and it's accurate to the one in the movie. and irina spalko's hair is to die for. on a side note, i don't get why they made marion's arms white in the set. the shirt underneath her vest in the movie is obviously blue. i switched the arms out for light blue ones and it looks a lot better, and it makes marion's eyes look great. -ryan

1 an extremely thorough review - you definitely do this set justice. looks like a fairly interesting set, and that comes from someone who isn't particularly a fan of lego indiana jones. tom

0 what a fantastic set. i'm overwelmed with feelings of nostalgia by seeing this review. the playability factor of this set is as high as it can be. thanks for making and sharing this awesome review !

1 thanks for this review! you have reviewed my most favourite town set of all times, i am so happy to own this one. i actually is a story to go along with it: in the summer of 1998 i went on holiday with my parents to the country of luxembourg, in the city of wiltz we encountered a small toystore which still had this set for sale, (9 years after the release!). i did not had the sufficient amount of money to buy the set and had to leave it at the store, i was practically in tears... four years later we passed through luxembourg and i remembered the city and the store. we made a detour and stopped by the same store. every other old set was sold, the only one remaining was this one! i bought it immediately and treasured it ever since. i use the baseplates a lot in my cities, they serve well as roads with parking spaces next to them. this was the first set i owned which had the huge 6x24 plates in them, i remember my surprise when seeing plates of such enourmous lenght... i recently made an entire racetrack together with this set and to promote myself i will place a link here

0 ahhhh... back in the days when shell was the racing fuel of choice before that octan company came to town, bought off the old shell execs and ran them out of town on a rail... but i digress... i always liked the look of the set, but at the time could not work out where i would be able to fit it into my town...

0 wow simon you got two? yummy!

0 thank you for the nice review metalandi, and thank you for the nice story and selfpromotion simon willems. the racewaytracks were always nice dioramas in the catalogues of the eighties.

1 i can remember when i saw this set in lego catalogues, looking at it, dreamin to have it.... like so many other sets... and this one is still a dream... i really like the design of this set, it looks really complete, with some nice details. there are no lost place. the strairs withe the foot bridge add a lot to it imo. looking at the pics, i've got a question : is the "rescue rig" trailer one piece or is it brick build?

0 adik_sa_lego, on may 15 2008, 08:29 pm, said: wow simon you got two? yummy! i'd be happy if i had two... no, it's just one, but extended with the baseplate of 6381 (mentioned above) and some more plates and small fences. alex54, on may 15 2008, 10:20 pm, said: looking at the pics, i've got a question : is the "rescue rig" trailer one piece or is it brick build? it is one piece, not even the wheels come off... this trailer is always ready to go and was only used in a slecect number of sets.

0 thank you very much for that fine review of a really classic and wonderful racing set! and i really wish that tlc would continue with showing some great alternative models on the back of the boxes.... just imagine on!

-1 hello all, i don't believe there has been a review of this set yet, so i wanted to take this opportunity. up for review today is 8160 cruncher block and racer x as part of batbrick and iamded reviews: here is the box, i have to say i love the art on it. it's very colourful and makes the truck look a lot less crap than it does on the box. plus, you have to love the "missile launching action" bit right, am i right? why are you all staring at me? and here is the back. pretty generic, but shows some nice details and so forth. oh dear! in turning around the box have i killed myself and iamded!? okey dokey, up first is the best part of the entire set: the minifigs! racer x is wonderful, though coming with a boring bruce wayne face. but it is cruncher block, his lady driver taejo that really shine. look at those awesome suits! the cool faces! taejo has a ripped shirt! now up is the first building part of the set, with me and iamded looking rather slick in x's car. while i'm not a big fan of yellow, it is very nice, and slopes in an underused colour is better than no slopes at all: front view, the new windshields are fantastic: while a very cool car, it is rather silly of tlc to give us the exact same one we got in the smaller set. i didn't get the smaller set with this car, so i'm still happy, but it is a bad marketing move: sorry iamded, i know it's your birthday, but......vroom! now for the second part of the build and my favourite, the front of the truck: annoyingly enough, this part opens up to shoot a pointless rubber projectile: to do this, you open the roof (a nice detail btw) and pull back the mechanism, here: thus blowing the front part open and launching it.....well, not far really the wheels and covers are pretty cool, and the front is nicely designed, the red looks good and the rear vision mirrors are a great touch. and now for the most disappointing part - step three, the trailer: (note - clicky joint piece not part of set, just used to hold it up!) that's right, almost the entire thing is open, even the "filled in" side has holes! i'd certainly be cared to be back there, one bumpy hill and back you go! i didn't put the lame computer stickers on, and the control area is pretty lame in general. not to mention taejo (who is depicted on the boxart as standing at the desk, would most likely just be sucked out the back at those speeds! there are some pluses too though, like the ridiculously awesome minifig paintings i'll be using for wayne manor. also note the "control" on cruncher's desk that when turned, turns the gun at the bottom. it's an alright feature: here is an example, i've shot iamded on his birthday. what? it's a love ray! haven't you seen the care bears? and though i'm not a massive fan of stickers, this is just too cool. the little aquarium is very simple but very clever, using a printed piece between two clear windows to create the illusion of a tank: it looks much better in real life, trust me, and here is a side view to better explain: now, to connect the two is a good thing, i like the way a simple technic piece assumes the job. oh, and behold my hand! the completed truck, which, while a mixed bag, still doesn't look too bad (i guess): now the completed set, which, despite its unbelievable large flaws, still looks cool. (warning, the kickass iamded and batbrick figures do not come with this set): more pics here: http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=3147324 all in all: minifigs: 5/5 - racer x is beautiful, cruncher block and the driver too, and taejo has a ripped shirt, damn! design: 2/5 - pretty poor considering the best part is available in a cheaper set, and only the front part of the truck looks cool, but still not truly awful. build: 3/5 - despite having a bad trailer, it was a fun build and sometimes you need something that doesn't take ages to make. price: 2/5 - overpriced easily, but rogue shadow is worse! fun: 3/5 - the mere concept of such an open truck kept me playing with this baby for hours! total: 15/25, not as bad as it would seem. overall i'm really glad i bought it as the minifigs are fantastic and the paintings and fish tank are cool. it's fun, stupid and downright ridiculous, but while not a great set by any means, certainly isn't as bad in the brick as it looks in photos. until next time, batbrick away! edited by batbrick, 13 june 2008 - 12:20 pm.

-1 awesome review batbrick! i don't see any appeal at all really in this set, but that's okay, as i want to stick to castle anyway. the car is the best part imo, which you can get in a different set with another cool car and for a cheaper price. but the main downfall to this set is the fact that the truck's trailer is half blown up and the survivors are magically staying inside and not being sucked right out of there, as you have mentioned. i would have thought tlc would at least included some sort of cover that you could take on and off easily (kind of like the modular buildings). having said all that though, the front of the truck does look incredibly cool, and those minifigs are sweet. too bad they all have flesh tone printed on them. so, while this may not be my set of choice, i can see the appeal... well, really i can't, but it's just my opinion! i'm sure there are plenty others who would love to scoop this set up. ~peace

0 thanks for that fine review, batbrick. the most interesting part of the set, for me, are the neat mfs.... the trailer looks really pretty skeletal. however.... its a nice little play set andll fit its purpose i guess.

0 nice review. good pictures, thanks. i think i may get a couple of the smaller sets, as i think these will become collectors sets in years too come, not sure this range will be that popular? love the minifigs though.

-1 batbrick thanks for the sweet review. you give me great insights into this set. hehe, i agreed that racer x is nice, but i believe we can get it in the other set for a much lower price. for me, the trailer which does not have a cover is bugging me alot. that's why, i holding my reservations against this set. at most, i will consider the other 2 smaller sets for collection purpose. nevertheless, batbrick great job

-1 thanks for the review. my wife wanted me to buy this for the fishtank, and i came close! untimately this set didn't offer many good part to me so i bought the smaller set with the same car. the trailer is just too insubstantial...

1 thanks for the great review! it seems like the most awesome part of the set is the sticker sheet, which is a reversal of the usual situation!

1 i really like this set: my favorite parts are the minifigs and x's car. vrooom!

0 i enjoyed the review. some cool fleshie heads and parts, but it does seem a bit lamer even than i imagined from the box (the "airy" truck is rather slyly disguised on the box art). i would like to get it if it is ever on sale, 50% off would be nice :) speed racer lego doesn't seem to be selling too well in local shops here.

0 hi all newly arrived today, don't you just love shop at home. thought i'd give it a quick review. see more details over at my site. the tumbler: joker's ice cream suprise

1 good review. a must have for my batman collection. are these sets already out in germany?

1 good review.i think the sets amazing!

1 the batman minifig have a detailed and cool torso. thanks for the review brickbitz. edited by darkrebellion, 16 may 2008 - 07:31 pm.

0 that is a very nice and quick review! thanks for giving us a quick summary. not much comments on this set, as i do not really go into batman theme yet. however, the ice cream truck in the set interest me. apart from that, nothing much yet. who knows, maybe i will change my mind in the future.

1 must...get...!!

1 nice review, brickbitz. i actually think this kit is really very nice for the size. true, you only get three figures, but it seems that's a norm in most batman sets. besides, everything else is great. the tumbler looks like an amazing build - they really nailed this tank of a ride. and the ice cream truck... plus, this set does seem to have some neat pieces in it (trans green popsicles and lime hubcaps, anyone?). i think this far beats the rest of the batman lineup this year, which seems quite disapointing overall. edited by grevious, 16 may 2008 - 08:12 pm.

0 oh wait, is that torso dark grey or light grey?

0 ronan nissen, on may 16 2008, 10:05 pm, said: oh wait, is that torso dark grey or light grey? it's definitely dark grey.

0 trooperdavinfelth, on may 16 2008, 11:11 pm, said: although i know you don't take many pictures in your reviews(imho, ) but can we see a little more about the tumbler? i'll get some set up tomorrow in better light. to be honest there isn't a lot to see, most of it is just basic technic blocks underneath with all the slopes built up on top.

1 thanks a lot for the review brickbitz. i really love this set, sure the figs are annoyingly not new, but the ice cream truck is fantastic and the tumbler is a marvel of black slopes. i see now that it is far too huge though, i reckon i will either keep it that way as a "mega tumbler", mod it to become another battank, keep it as a model tumbler, or pull it apart and use the bits to make a tumbler like wetwire's awesome one. love those popsicles though, and those wheels are very nice, so overall as a loyal batfan i love the set, even though it could've been better. batbrick away!

1 a nice review of an interesting set, thanks brickbitz. a great new batman, a funny ice cream truck and a pretty detailed tumbler. and although i wish that vehicle would be just a bit smaller i almost wonder that its not even bigger, compared to tlcs other batvehicles.... and well, the interior could be better too....

1 the tumbler is massive! i'll struggle to fit it into the cave, but never mind. the figs are nice, the tumbler is pretty accurate (or at least, it will be after i've moded it), and joker's tainted ice cream van is so very joker. thanks for the review, btw.

0 hey brickbitz, i love how your review is not biased 10 ups. in the end, you said, "overall slightly disappointing." most people post reviews only with praise, but i'm glad you take both sides . enjoyed the review just like others have, thanks so much

no doubt you all know the story of grievous; two parts technic and one part human and his hatred of the jedi. follow along as we get a close-up view of the mighty general. no doubt the observant will wonder why i purchased this set from shop @ home instead of my trusty lego store in glendale. well, its really as simple as two things: ive been traveling a lot and didnt have time to drive to the store to get it and gas is now $4/gallon and i would likely spend more in gas than the $9 shipping cost to get it to me. so there you have it. the box: a gigantic box (much larger than expected) held the mighty general. were back to the perforated tabs on the side and two stickers on the front that let the box lift open: inside, we have 17 bags, two manuals and three stickers on a relatively small sticker sheet. the manuals: the manuals are not terribly thick in fact the second manual is noticeably thinner than the first. they come in at 75 and 31pages. interesting to note on the back we see the next (and more interesting) wave of sets later this summer. nothing new to report on the manuals as they provide the lego standard of high quality and features we expect. - piece callouts - models divided into sections - large images - page numbers since there were links posted to the .pdf files of the instructions online, im sure you can all get an idea of the manual and the parts inventory. however, for those of you without access to the internet here are photos of the parts inventory pages: random manual image: features page: the pieces: the short answer is you get lots and lots of little pieces in white, gray and black plus some big pieces in white, gray and black. mixed in the set is a fair amount of oddball pieces like minifig tools, jedi hood and trans yellow dome. fear not, despite the eclectic collection of parts, it all comes together in the end (not unlike a typical day at work for me) it is probably worth noting again that there is a heavy amount of technic parts and pieces here. the build: the build starts off with a rather in-depth build of the stand in which general grievous stands on. once you think you are done, you keep adding on to this (rather solid) base. i bet there are 250 pieces just in the base alone! it is quite nice when you get done with it though and really adds to the display. im glad lego didnt skimp on the base as it completes the model. once you get through all that, the rest of the build is a real thumb-bruiser. anyone who has built a decent size technic set knows the feeling of your thumbs being sore when you are done. you get the same effect here. it is actually a fun build and i really liked seeing how the designers used all the various pieces to recreate a fairly accurate model of grievous. the model is built from the ground up as seen in a few of the progress shots: here is what is left over: the design: the design is quite good and is very accurate. some might be disappointed that since this is a technic set we dont have more articulation in the shoulders and have the ability to separate two arms into four as seen in the movie. however, it would seem the real intent is for display and not functionality. here is a shot of the torso and the detail involved: here are grievous organs: careful observers will note that my model is lacking two arrow stickers from the two white chest pieces. i failed to see these on the sticker sheet and only grabbed the large grievous sticker. so, note that there are actually three stickers and not one. chest protector and respirator: head and arms: i was a little disappointed that we got two yellow blades and no green blades on the lightsabers. note how all the lightsabers have different hilts which is a nice touch: here are some shots of the completed model with a few other sets shown for scale. he is actually pretty tall: you have the option to remove the top two arms and put in shoulder plates if you so desire: detail on the back: overall thoughts: ive been saying for a few years that we should have a technic grievous set and we finally got one. designed more as a model and not a fully functional swooshable figure, grievous is a tad flimsy. you wont want him to veer too far off his massive and sturdy base. it would have been nice to have is cape with him (like the technic vader set). i do like the size of the model and it is impressive to look at. lego star wars system fans will likely want to think twice before purchasing but technic and ucs fans should be satisfied. final rating: 75% build 8/10 (very good  fun, relatively quick build. technic fans will be more pleased than others.) design 8/10 (very good  some nice snot and technic techniques. a bit flimsy but the base is kind of cool.) parts 7/10 (a mixed bag of stuff. probably cant get too many diverse builds from this except for other robot type models.) price 7/10 (just ok  a bit stiff at $90 usd for a nice display model with limited functionality.) as always, lets hear your thoughts and feedback.

-1 thanks so much dunamis for your awesome review . yeah i think tlc miss the cape, it would be cool to own one but when we were talking of the 2008 sets around july of last year i can remember someone said it would come with cape. finally is a little dissapoint tlc miss it . edited by darkrebellion, 16 may 2008 - 07:20 pm.

1 excellent review, dunamis. this set looks great. the designers really though the kit out, it seems. the internal organs have got to be my favorite part, but everything is good. now all we need is a ucs obi-wan with a laser pistol to finish off grievous in a totally anti-climatic way!

0 hey dunamis, think you can get a straight-on shot of the face? the red pieces inside the eye sockets are topped with trans-greenish-yellow studs which make his face look eerily alive and very close to his screen appearance. it's a nice little detail that seems to not show through on pictures i've seen of the set. the legs are a little wobbly. i'm scared that he'll be leaning too far forward in about 5 years

1 nice review dunamis ! i built it two weeks ago on the legoworld speedbuild in oslo and didnt have time to get the "feel" during that crazy race. i agree with you that the base is nice & sturdy, makes it stand real still ! im looking forward on your next score! four eyes arms on copmike

0 i do a easy answer to you dunamis and just double post cms answer... i was there as well! copmike, on may 17 2008, 12:42 am, said: nice review dunamis ! i built it two weeks ago on the legoworld speedbuild in oslo and didnt have time to get the "feel" during that crazy race. i agree with you that the base is nice & sturdy, makes it stand real still ! im looking forward on your next score! four eyes arms on copmike sturdy on!! -ras-

1 cool! i like the idea of using the hood as an organ! dunamis reviews on!

1 thanks for this very detailed review dunamis! didn't think that gg were that big he looks pretty good to me, but i'll save the 90 for the upcoming cw sets

1 thanks for that fine review, dunamis. i really like that set.... ggs an interesting and well designed movie character and that lego version of hims indeed well done and very detailed. and although i would wish for a some more functional (or playable ) feature of move- and even splitable arms i guess its an already very cool ucs version of that grumpy old kaleesh....

0 ok, here are a couple of shots of the head and eyes: a very nice effect. any, silly me, in my first set of photos above, i never folded in his ribcage (you guys gotta call me out on these things). here is what it is supposed to look like: anyway, carry on...

1 quote since there were links posted to the .pdf files of the instructions online, im sure you can all get an idea of the manual and the parts inventory. however, for those of you without access to the internet here are photos of the parts inventory pages: luckily for me i have access to the internet to read this review in the first place seriously though, nice review! my girlfriend has told me that i can't have this one after we just got through a 3-day build of the 10030 star destroyer... but i'm sure i can turn her around eventually... :)

1 awesome review, dunamis! that's such a sweet set, i loved it as soon as i thoroughly examined the online instructions. it looks way awesome in the brick, my favourite part has to be the eyes. very cool, and creepy. thanks again for the info, and of course the pics! ~peace

0 an excellent review with superb presentation dunamis . when the time comes i hope your able to get your hands on the other new sw sets and review them just as good.

-1 snice review! (super nice) though i think i'll pass on this one, i really dislike the head. what's with the frame around the neck and the clip under the head? that, and i don't really care for ucs or technic stuff. the base looks nice though!

1 detailed report,thx for sharing.i love to see the special parts of it!you persuaded me to buy this!

0 great review, very detailed indeed!

0 thanks for the great review! sad to say, as cool as he looks, he's a sale-only set for me.

1 hi all again. another one of todays special deliveries. i think personally this set is great. mars mission is really finding it's feet. 7646 etx alien infiltrator

1 the walker reminds me of the old kenner cap-2 captivator which is good.

1 thanks for that interesting review, brickbitz. the alien fighter looks pretty nice, nothing special but streamlined and fast nevertheless. that transforming features a nice addition for sure, and these new flicker missile with its launch apparatus.... hmm, i hope i wont spend quite some time in search of that little 'rocket' piece.... however, theres still something i miss with these alien crafts.... i dont know.... i like some more organic looking design, and they even come in some nice and different shapes, but still.... perhaps a real space fighter just needs a solid cockpit, cool windscreens and controls to satisfy my odd likings. that 'exo suit' looks really good and i wonder why its a little underrepresented on the box art. the jet pack/space scooters a really good idea, and the only thing i hatere those darned studless technic beams.... it could look so much better with a studded version of these parts. but of course thats only due to my personal preferences.

0 thanks for the review brickbitz i don't normally come into the space forum but this set it tempting me, on the basis of you review i think i might aquire one at some point.

0 damn!!! i was just about to post a review on this here's the infiltrator with the nice shiny holographic stickers! [attachment=2232:mars_mis...tor_tiny.jpg] edited by the rancor, 18 may 2008 - 12:59 pm.

1 lol your sig is awesome! the little power suit is well done, i would like to see articulation some how jammed into the little legs though, and we all now exoforce 4 finger hands would look great on his arms. edited by rayskull, 18 may 2008 - 04:51 pm.

1 excellent review as usual, brickbitz. i really love this set. the moonwalker is amazing, and the alien craft is really nice too. i might get this someday...

0 my first impression upon seeing this set was "no thanks", but now i'm warming up to it. still, i'll skip it if it interferes with my hypersonic operations aircraft fund. :p

1 hi y'all! guess what happened today? when walked into my toys 'r' us in fullerton, ca, just to buy a simple tiny turbo racer, what do i see? all the agents sets sitting on the shelf, ready for the taking! i didn't have too much money with me, so i just got 2 of 8631 mission 1: jetpack pursuit! it's a really cool little set, so i thought i'd review this puppy for you! i shall proceed in the order of the instructions. so, let's get started! the minifigs let's begin with the minifigs, saw fist and agent chase! they are really cool, some of the coolest minifigs i have seen in a while! i took off saw fist's wig & chainsaw so you can see his head and cybernetic arm better! here is a back view of saw fist, and - surprise! agent chase has a double sided head! one side with his cool "mission face" with sunglasses and headset, and one with his casual bruce wayne type face (note, though, that it is not really the bruce wayne face). his wig, btw, is mutt's hairpiece in black! very neat! poor saw fist seems to be forced to always drag his chainsaw around for it is way too long to just hang down from his shoulder like a normal arm. the snowmobile next up, we have the snowmobile, a sleek little vehicle with only minor design flaws! the container with the jewel is attached to the vehicle by a single stud, so it doesn't fall off, but is easy to pick up! in the pic below you can see the only two tiny design flaws: thanks to the exhaust pipes, the laser cannon (or whatever it's supposed to be) can't be lowered any further than this. also, the corners of that slope-ish piece that the handle bar rests on are sticking out a little at the sides. other than that, it's pretty well done! the jetpack finally, there is the jetpack! imo, a name like autogyro-pack or something would make more sense, but whatever. although a little bulky, the jetpack is very well designed! the rotor can be tilted back, and at the lower back of the jetpack, there is hook with which you can grab the container with the jewel from the snowmobile. what i like best about the jetpack is that although it is attached to the minifig in kinda the same way as that of the riddler, this one doesn't rotate around. so, the agent is being held in place steadily! "see ya later, chainsaw-cyborg-dude!" stickers this set comes with a surprisingly large sticker sheet. the reason is that half of it are extra stickers! there are two large agents logos and one inferno logo - perfect for agents mocs! there are also a star and a small, round sticker portraying the number of the mission. the star seems to be part of some kind of game where you collect the stars from all sets on an agents id that you get from the mission 5 set. i don't know, though, if you get any gain from this except for becoming a full-status lego agent! below, you can find the list of parts from this set! click here for a better quality pic! that's pretty much it! i hope you liked this review and will run straight to your next toy store to get one or more of this set! this was my very first set review! so any questions, comments, or requests? any more pics you want me to take? would you like me to exchange the chainsaw with something else, or do you want me to try the agent's new hairpiece out on another fig? if so, just tell me! see ya! edited by oky wan kenobi, 25 june 2009 - 08:21 pm.

1 thanks for the excellent review oky! judging by this set, the line is going to be promising. i really like the figs and i'm glad to see that robot arm is actually a new arm mold. awesome!! can a minifig hand fit in the end or just the chainsaw attachment? could it fit an exo-force robot claw? there's a lot of detail in the torsos and i like that the agent's suit is like a moto-cross uniform. i love that the snowmobile has a working tread. copmike, ras and i tried to build a snowmobile with working treads, but we ended up using chainsaw blades in the end. great work oky!

0 that's a great review for your first one. i think the jet pack if far to bulky it could do with some minimising but thats life. i assume that you cant fit a standard hand in the chainsaw arms are the hole would be to large but would you be so good as to confirm this for me? overall i quite like the jet ski and the ability to lower the arms to much doesnt both me. how much was it just so i can get an idea of the price? finally thanks for posting this review so quickly.

1 thanks for the great review oky wan the two vehicles look quite nice for a small set and the minifigs look great! the two sided head is nice, although it would've been nice if it was a new head rather than the standard frowning face. the cyborg looks good, nice and cartoony, i like the printing on his back. the belt on the hips should be useful, not to mention the robotic hand. i assume that anything that fits into a 1x1x1 cylinder can fit in it? i hope so thanks again oky. any chance you can get any more sets?

0 thanks for the review. i'm looking forward to some of the new parts and ideas in this line. the figures look great. the actual sets themselves don't really appeal though.

0 thanks, guys! i really tried to make it a good first review! now to answer your questions: the robot arm can fit ef robot claws and anything that a minifig can hold in his hand or that would fit into a 1x1x1 cylinder, so normal minifig hands are too small to fit. tlg is using the robot claw idea for the main villain of the agents line! do you still want me to try it out and take pics? the price was 10.99 usd at the tru i bought it at. i bet it'ss be a dollar less on s@h! and i'm sorry, but i probably won't get any more sets any time soon. i have to save my money for all the other good set that are to come. but if i would get another set, it would just be the one with the helicopter and the all-silver car! if anyone gets this set, can he/she please review it? thanks! any other questions i can answer for you guys? edited by oky wan kenobi, 18 may 2008 - 08:59 am.

1 oky wan, thanks for this wonderful review! i really have mixed feelings towards agents set. haha, but i love the agent mini-figure. the double-sided face is great and i love the sunglass look. it's nice that they made use of mutt's hairpiece which is personally my fave hairpiece at the moment the jet-pack is neat. making use of the additional secure backing onto the mini-fig is really very smart.

1 nice first review oky wan ! id say this is better than we first thought. the minifigs looks cool and the overall look is ok. and the excaustpipe is a new peace also i think? agents on copmike

1 i kind of like the set. as said it has a very cartoonish style to it so i'm guessing the kids are going to love it. and as a parent i'll love it if the construction isn't to fragile. ;) i'll probably be getting a few for myself but only as parts pack. copmike, on may 18 2008, 11:29 am, said: and the excaustpipe is a new peace also i think? yeah and it's all over this years releases. from what i've seen so far it's found in: racers, speed racers, mars mission and exo-force sets. i just wish that instead of a 2x1 plate with an exhaustpipe in each end they would have made it an 1x1 plate with a single exhaust. that would have been a lot more useful.

0 omg omg omg. im coming to the us in just under two weeks, really hope i see them somewhere! does anyone know what ny times square toys r us is like for new sets?

1 i love the way the bad guy has a special attachment on the jewel case just to allow the agent to grab it with his hook. it's like the two of them sat down beforehand and drew up the plans for the vehicle together... cyborg: "ok, and then i'll make my getaway in the special snowmobile and you can follow me..." agent: "...and i'll scoop up the jewel and return it to foil your plan". cyborg: "perfect. see you tuesday?" dr. s.

-1 good review! thanks oky wan. hmm, although i really like the villain (not just the new arm, i think the color is very... villanous, as all bond-villains with class have minions in uniforms. it's even possible to fill out their numbers with exo-force grunts of the same color) i'm not that hot for the agent himself, his uniform... nah. it doesn't even look like clothes, just give the man a suit or some nifty leather. i think i'll try to grab some sets from the agents line just for the new parts (to begin with... mocs may follow, who knows?) when they are available in stores here in sweden. haven't seen them yet, though indiana jones just got here so there might be some further waiting for me. now i want to see reviews of the other sets :)

0 thanks for a very good review! agent line seems better all the time... looking forward in seeing review on mission 2 gold chase (and new pictures of the jet) really soon!

0 hmm, interesting set. great review! i might pick this one up for the wonderful parts. ~vbbn~

1 what a lovely set, thanks for that fine review, oky wan kenobi! the mfsre wonderful, that helipack looks solid and well done and i especially like the slightly asymmetrical design of the neat snowmobile. a very playable little set for sure, and the most interesting parts for sure that new cool mf arm....

0 yay, oky wan! wow, the agents line is looking good so far. the jetpack is pretty nice, and the minifigs... my dad was in portland just yesterday, and if i'd have called an hour sooner, he might have been able to get to the tru...

0 great review!thank youvery much! i think this line is much more promising than most orginally thought it would be. i'm onmy way to see ifican find the big rig right now!

1 thank you for the nice review. it has some big pieces i don't like, but the minifigs are good.

0 thank you.

0 thanks for the review! do i see a little indy hint on that map? oh and btw., the map looks like it actually is printed am i right?

1 looks good, and i'll bet that jaw and wire could be used for lots of mocs... is this the only agents set that contains the wire? while i'm here: i got the third mission, would anyone like a review of that? faramir

1 not many words this time, but as they say: a picture is worth a thousand words - and your pictures are lovely! once again, agents is turning out to be a cooler and cooler theme with each new review. this set looks like an awesome parts pack, and i love the bike! btw, anyone else notice the possibly accidental reference to alpha team? agent charge is back, it looks! edited by grevious, 21 may 2008 - 09:05 pm.

1 thanks for the review, this set is wonderful! u love the two dark green crocodiles and awesome minifigs, especially break jaw that bike is awesome and the base, like all agents sets, comes with great pieces, like the barbed wire, orange anything, leafy pieces and brown log pieces. thanks for the review, i'll definitely get this one! batbrick away!

1 wow, great review for a really great looking set. the pieces, like the minifigs and crocs are very nice, but that map is reeaally cool for an aztec/maya/inca fan (like me)! i will definately buy this set when it is available in england. grevious, on may 21 2008, 10:04 pm, said: btw, anyone else notice the possibly accidental reference to alpha team? agent charge is back, it looks! yeah, i thought that. then i thought, "nah, he looks different", but i remember that the characters in alpha team did change their looks a lot throughout the years (being spies and that). edited by shoc, 26 may 2008 - 10:37 am.

1 a really cool playset, thanks for these great pics, sirnadroj! a silver jaw helm, cycrocs, some cool faces and a very swooshable bike.... see you later, alligator! the only thing i dont get entirelyre these neat barbwire circles. whats the purpose with these.... life rings for masochists? well.... that makes me look at that tower in a completely new way too.... baddies baywatch on! but wherere the girls?

1 have you made any other reviews? i want more. please? i'm not planning to get this set, but its pretty cute. the set itself is okay, but the figs are amazing. agent charge: i want that head. unibrow man! great villain! crocs...

1 like all the others, (except the truck) this set is great. love the figs and the green crocidiles.

1 nice set... im definately gonna pick it up when i see it. i like the design of the base and it comes with lots of usefull an neat pieces.

1 great looking set! im determined to get all the agent sets this summer. comments: swamp tower-the barbed wire is cool, but it seems like its only for looks. bike-cool looking, but doesnt seem to have any controls. cybercrocs-wow, havent seen any of these pieces for a while, and in dark green, awesome! agent charge-sweet head, definitely cool. break jaw-he looks like the result of some animal testing on humans gone horribly wrong. i hope they come out near me soon.

1 wow, thanks for the great review, sirnadroj! the overall set is what attracted me in the first place, that elevated hut and swampy setting just sucked me right in! it all looks really nice to me, a definite buy. that agents head would make a great indy, for those opposed to fleshies. and that monobrow, i mean, villain guy looks very... er... well, the monobrow is unique, thought i noticed the suit looks a bit skin tight in the crotchal area. don't look at me like that, you saw it too! anyway, the helmet's the best part about the villain, great for warhammer 40,000 orks. ~peace

1 very useful pieces, that new agent head (i think it's new) could be used for a gordon freeman minifigure, and break jaw's head for otis the security guard when you take his donuts away from him.

1 sirnadroj, on may 21 2008, 08:36 pm, said: agent charge: looks like indy with 'roid rage... sirnadroj, on may 21 2008, 08:36 pm, said: treasure: map! nice map. is it a sticker or printed? steve

0 does anyone know if the turbo car chase is out yet?

1 i've copied another thing because i don't know how i must do a review. and i can't do long reviews! set ref: 7884 name: the buggy: the escape of mr freeze number of minifigs: 2 number of pieces: 76 price: 13,95 front of the box: back of the box: the comic: very close: what's in the box: without: the set: the set with the box: the time: wow, this is a funny set, but it's a little expensive, and a little to small, but i like some pieces like the fire, and the mr freeze gun. and the best of all, here it comes, no stickers! that's one of the greatest things. but i understand why lego has made this set, some people want batman lego, and they are most of the time expensive, and the mr freeze set is also expensive, but this set not. if you want more pics, you msut ask! for exaple for the minifigs, or the mr freeze and the blaster. ask it, and this is my first review and sorry for the great and blurry pics! the final verdict: 7.5/10 figures: 8/10 playability: 6/10 build: 7/10 pieces: 7.5/10

0 thanks for an interesting review, ???theriddler???. the sets cheap and very useful to get two fantastic mfs, a great mr. freeze and a very cool new batman. but i have to say that these two small vehicles just look plain ugly imho, without any inspiration nor orginality.... sorry, tlc, but you can for sure do better than that, and even with less pieces....

0 quote but i have to say that these two small vehicles just look plain ugly imho, without any inspiration nor orginality indead. the only reason to get this set is if you couldn't afford the batcave back in 2006 and want a mr. freeze fig for a cheap price. and anyone who did get that kit really have no reason whatsoever to get this. wait, did i forget something? oh yeah - thanks for the review, riddler. edited by grevious, 22 may 2008 - 11:54 pm.

0 thanks for the review! for such a high price that we need to fork out, compared to a total pieces of 76. it's is very expensive to pay for such poor design. but then, i will still considered to get them. as what sinner had said, this is a very good way to get mr freeze without getting the batcave. and it so happened that, i do not have the batcave too. i believed that is the cheapest set among the four. so, for the mini-figs only, this set is recommended. other than that, i am sorry.

-1 like many others, i'll buy this just for mr f, quickly recycle the parts, and pretend this set never existed. the flame detail is indeed terrible. the bat is back - and he's flatulent! this third bat-wave isn't really doing anything for me. i'll get the penguin set as well for pretty much the same reason - although the sub on that is pretty cool - but skip the others. maybe batbrick can make us all nice alt-mocs to improve these sets... thanks for the review though!

1 thanks for the review ???theriddler???. this is a neat little set, a bit overpriced in my opinion, but for a new suited batman and a mr freeze fig in a set other than one of the most expensive bat-sets released, it's worth my money. ~peace

0 wowie!!!!!! i'm glad you like it! maby i'l do the tumbler also! but soon the batcycle and the scuba also come!

0 pretty nice review for a first time ???theriddler???. next time though, if your camera has it, use the macro function (little flower icon) and perhaps a tripod. that should get rid of any blur and provide you with better pictures. apart from that, a good little review. keep up the good work!

1 neat little set. i do like the parts a number of hard to find bits all in one pack, depending on how much it costs in usd i'll have to consider it. and while the buggy designs kinda suck, i'm a little happy to see them, its been years since tlc made any small go kart style vehicles. i guess tiny turbos have been overshadowing that market?

0 thanks for the reveiw the figs are bloody great! but those cars are a bit... well i'll put it blantly, retarded!!! although they shall be good after some modding! and whats with that grapple hook? does it even have a rope, so i guess batman will hokk it to mr freeze so his ride looks more ugle anyway, can you pleese take some pics of the figs

1 that's a great set. it'd be even better if it were sold as two separate little cars. they remind me of the dozens of little lego cart vehicles i got as a kid. those were always fun, quick builds that resulted in lots of cool play. i think this set is aimed more at kids and, in that respect, it's a pure winner. it doesn't hurt that you can get freeze and the newly designed batman both in this set for a reasonable price.

0 thanks the penguin, and more pics on monday!

-1 thanks for the review. this set was poorly design, when i first heard of it i think it was like a car with a much better design than this one. i think i will get it for the minifigs.

0 the pics as promised. extra part:

-1 thanks for the review. i dont know if i would get this set though. the cars are not that great and the price is a little too high.

-1 i got this yesterday and built it this morning. apart from the figs, it is very crappy. mr freeze's buggy is ok but the bat buggy is easily the worst vehicle i've seen for years. colours are all over the place, the grappling hook feels cheaply made, the inclusion of those odd pearl silver parts which have been in the exo-force sets seem especially random here, the terrible bionicle flame piece... it's the first lego vehicle i've built where i've immediately had the urge to disassemble it and pretend i never bought it! really, i only got it for mr freeze so i shouldn't complain. but still. it's a real step backwards. the comparable catwoman dragster set was heaps better. the penguin sub is sweet though thanks for the review anyway!

1 coming in at around $50 us, turbo car chase is one of the bigger of the new agents sets. a big box with a helicopter, car, and gate in it. seems like a winner, but how good is it really, and is it worth the cash? let's start with the minifigs. this set comes with a standard inferno henchman, spy clops, and agent chase. the henchman is you basic lego criminal type with a gun and a jumpsuit, nothing real groundbreaking here. spy clops, on the other hand, is very cool for, technically, half of a minifig. his head has a neat electronic goggle print and the rest of him is a torso mounted onto a set of six legs made from exo-force robot arms. the whole thing is really well done and neat as hell. agent chase (turbo car chase! ) seems to have a standard agent body and a double-printed face with one side a sunglasses and headset print. the other face is a determined agent look. the set also includes a laptop with doctor inferno wallpaper. the laptop is a new piece and works like the lego books that are in a lot of harry potter sets. molding on the keyboard is really well done and the thing can be held by a minifig along either corner, but not in the middle and not while closed. the gate in the set is nothing revolutionary by itself, and i sort of get the feeling that it was included to drive up the piece count and the set price point. that being said, there are some things to like here. for instance, the gate has four wheels of barbed wire attached to it. the barbed wire is new and makes me want to start building some world war i trench mocs. the rest of the gate is fairly big and it has a handy ramp attached so that vehicles can roll through it easily. the main feature of the gate is a sound brick. it's much better then lego sound and light units of the past, when the gate is opened it depresses a button and an alert klaxon blares that sounds every bit like a prison-beak in progress. the triggering action works surprisingly well and it's pretty much for this feature alone that i'm not going to immediately break the gate back down and add it to my parts bin. the designers did make an effort to create more then just a fence though. a nice control panel connected to a big spotlight crowns the piece, and a pair of cameras watch the opening. it's really hard to mess up a lego helicopter, and this set is no exception. the inferno chopper is a nicely proportioned and well built machine. it looks properly menacing and has the uniform orange and black of other inferno property. it's armed with a set of four technic pegs cleverly used as guns on outriding mounts, as well as a pair of the newer-style flick-fire missiles. i personally don't care for flick-firing missiles, but these look decent enough and seem to stay put so i really can't complain about them. along the fuselage are a pair of intake pieces that i've never seen before and i'm guessing are new. they're pretty well designed and will come in handy for mocing down the road. the action feature of the aircraft is the wench system. this is very different then other lego wenches in that you build the entire mechanism and housing. you can then use it to raise spy clops up and down from the bottom of the chopper using the rotor. now, this also keeps you from sitting there and just giving the rotor repeated spins to simulate flight. i'm not too thrilled with that, but there are a hundred other lego helicopters out there with fully rotating rotors, so i guess i can let it by just this once. as you'd suspect, the bottom of the cockpit is completely open, which makes this a vehicle pretty much solely for spy clops (sorry henchman). but there is plenty of room beneath the body to attach a plate with some seats on it to accommodate another pilot without drastically altering the design, or even removing existing pieces. the turbo car is a slick little honey of a lego car, and the silver pieces that make up the body work contribute a lot to that fact. the front license plate appears to be an exo-fore code brick. but it also hides the activation lever for the passenger ejector seat. the seat works about as well as the spruce goose, which is to say not well at all, but here it's the thought that counts. the interior of the car is really well done. there's even a radar screen for keeping track of pesky helicopters. but the bond-like features don't end there. a lever in the compartment raises pair of guns in the hood and a knob on the rear deploys a quad rocket system with more flick-fire missiles. this is a car that won't be stopped easily! the rear has two cones sticking out. i'd like to think they're smoke nozzles or oil-slick sprayers. all-in-all, this is a really good set. the car is pure lego vehicle love and looks fantastic. the silver pieces are very nice and it's a shame lego doesn't use metallic colors in system sets more often. there are, however, a lot of sticker for this set and i know how much that bugs a lot of people. i personally like how much detail the stickers add to these sets and don't mind them so much. the set also comes with an agents id card for chase which you can put little star stickers on from other sets as you get them. it's printed on a real nice piece of sturdy plastiboard and would be cooler if you could put your own picture and name on it instead of pretending to be chase. sold by themselves, the car and chopper would be must-haves. all tossed together with the gate sort of makes the set a little less then the sum of it's parts. and with 498 parts (most of them small) that's not so hot. it's only slightly over-priced in my opinion, but if you do shell out the money you won't regret it. i'm very comfortable recommending this set to anyone. close to perfect, but the price and some minor flaws bring it back just a little. i'd say 4.33, but out of 5 is close enough!

1 can't wait for the review the car is ly!!!

1 deinonychus, on may 23 2008, 10:12 pm, said: pics and thoughts tomorrow! i picked up this set earlier in the week and was quite pleased with it (in fact i have missions 1-5 and am happy with all of them - this series is much better than the old alpha team ever was). i look forward to reading your thoughts on it. i will say 2 things about it now though. 1)my set came with defective instructions. in 2 places pages are missing and duplicates of other pages repeated. for instance, the car instructions are missing steps 16-21. fortunately, i was able to make out what pieces went where in the missing steps by studying the illustration in step 22. i hope you have better luck with your instructions. 2)this set contains the best lego sound brick ever (it's just begging to be incorporated into my arkham asylum).

1 great review, deino! man, that car is just so beautiful, and the helicopter is nice too. unfortunately, this seems pretty pricy, and i hardly think i'll be getting it any time soon, what with my limited budget and all. still, it's great to see how well agents is shaping up.

1 thanks for the review deino! i love going back through the old "agents" thread just to see how wrong we were about these awesome sets! i actually really like the gate, those portcullis pieces people may know i always find nice uses for, and i really, really, really want that awesome sound brick. the figs are a bit disappointing in numbers, but agent chase is very cool, generic henchman are great, and spy clops is one of my favourite minifigs ever! the helicopter is wonderful too, i love that it is customised for spy clops to winch him down. the colours as usual for these sets are fantastic, the dark blue, orange and chrome silver! the car is the best though, i love all the functions. how does the ejector seat work though? batbrick away!

0 deinonychus, on may 23 2008, 09:12 pm, said: the rear has two cones sticking out. i'd like to think they're smoke nozzles or oil-slick sprayers. according to page 14 of my brickmaster magazine, the left cone is for smoke screen and the right cone is for oil slick.

1 thanks deinonychus for another great review. i must say i do look forward to people uploading reviews of new sets, it really helps me decide if i want it or not. if it's a good set (imo) then it adds to the excitement of picking up one myself! this, i must say, is one of those sets! the only concern for me, like alot of others, is the price. i will just have to wait and see and continue to look at these photo's deinonychus has provided for us!! so much for thinking the agent line was going to be weak! i wonder if the exoforce style code brick number plate is a hint from tlc as to what will replace exoforce at the end of this year? jb

1 thanks for the great review! i'm really liking these agents sets the more i see them. the car seems to have alot of features. its to bad the the ejection seat doesn't work as well as one would hope. oh well. makes me want the big rig even more now!

0 looking closely at the red cones on the missles, and grey cones on the car's rear these appear to be a new piece. note how there is a slight stopper ridge at the base of their top stud. interestingly, the trans green cones on the helicopter seem to be of the older mould style.

1 thanks for your great review! it looks very nice indeed! the gate have very interesting mechanism. the car looks very slick and cool. it looks like those typical kind of james bond car. this review gives me very good insights.

1 great review and fantastic pics, deinonychus. and a big thank you to whoever pointed out that you could use the sound brick for arkham asylum, my addled brain didn't make the connection. the car is just beautiful, and with a good use for the most expensive part of the gate, this is on my wish list for sure, just have to see how much cash is left over after buying the new death star in a month or two. agents has to be the biggest surprise from lego for ages, without any pics it sounded so-so, but they've done a brilliant job with it, love those metallic coloured pieces!

1 great w, im totaly gonna buy this set

1 great review thanks for sharing

1 hello all eurobricks members, i will present to you a very short review on the recent castle battlepacks. this time, i will be reviewing skeleton battlepack, and i hope everyone of you do enjoy viewing it. this was a request that put up by hollisbrick in the castle thread. initally, i thought it was a very simple set to do a review. however, for the love of castle, i decided to whip this up for every castle fan out there. this is an image of how the skeleton battlepacks look like. i have bought 12 last packs of these in total so far but none of the crown battlepacks yet. there were snapped much faster, that i imagined. do pardon me for the poor lightning. today is a bad weather, it's hard to get natural light. the skeleton gang for a single battlepack like this, with an attractive reasonable price. you obtained a series of 5 skeleton mini-figs with tons and tons of useful castle accessories. to me, it's a very very great buy, and it's a must to stock up for my army building! some add-ons! however, i was not very satisfied with my skeleton armies standards. therefore, i decided to make some slight modifications with some additional castle accessories that is stocked in my castle warehouse. after the makeover, ok, this is what i called a real skeleton army. this is mainly my opnion and it have to be aligned with my standards. i felt this improved battlepack gives a punch to the exisitng battlepack. the two soliders on the right, is able to align with the rest of my castle chess sets armies. while the one on the left, it gives me a great archer back up with the quiver and helmet attached to him. the ones, on the center especially the armored guard which equipped with the black nose cone helmet is my fave. it is able to illustrate the "elite" among the rest of the guards with its armor and helmet which was featured in my castle deep forest expansion moc.. promotion on! in addition, the one which was hastly done with a modify mace, it looks rather simple. in time to come, i will change it and gives a better equipment and look. these are the remains. i can use the axe for my dwarf in my dwarf mine defender. in that set, there is no weapon for my dwarf and i have to get it from other sets. the rest of the accessories, makes a very good stock up for future upgrading! overall: 9/10 this is not a playset. it is mainly bought for its abilty to mass recurit any armies, and is a main love for all castle army builders such as me! this set mainly have no major faults, and i love it so much. although, i have done some slight modifciations, but this set is a must for me to buy more and more! meanwhile, i will need to wait for the next shipment! hope everyone have enjoying viewing this simple review of mine! edited by whitefang, 25 may 2008 - 12:52 pm.

1 thanks for the review whitefang. i love these sets, and i wish they were available in nz. so far, it seems they may never come here... but i can sit and hope. i like the look of them after your make-over, a real skeleton army there! did you say you've bought 12! tht's lots of skelies. are you planning a big moc or something?

1 thanks, whitefang! castle battle packs.... simply wonderful! finally a dream came true, well done tlc!

1 thanks whitefang! i love this battlepack, but can only really hope to get one. still, great accesories and a spider! that's great! batbrick away!

1 hollisbrick, on may 25 2008, 08:54 pm, said: thanks for the review!!! it wasn't "really" a request but more of an imply to do it anyway great review! can't wait til these come to aus. probably when the rest of the castle comes out in september though well, i am glad you enjoyed this review. i hope these excellent battlepacks will reach the coast of australia and the rest of the world soon. guess then, we will have to wait till september 08. mammymarf, on may 25 2008, 11:37 pm, said: thanks for the review i wanted to see what was in this set looks good! is it sold in stores? yes, i have bought these from stores in my country. however, it came in limited quantity and it was snapped out within moments. mack, on may 26 2008, 12:47 am, said: i wish these battlepacks had a reasonable price click here to see the canadian price of these battlepacks, 18 dollars thats 6 dollars more than the starwars battlepack yet you get the same amount of lego (or less then a starwars battlepack). how the megablok does lego price its items . i'm gonna have to skip this set, and a few others that i wanted because of this bloody outrageous. back on topic thanks for the detailed review, whitefang i also like your little changes to the set they really make this set look better. mack, i am glad you liked the little changes i made. yes, the price for the battlepacks is a little steep. however for the amount of mini-figs and castle accessories, the price and quantity justifiy my bulk purchase. this is one way to acquired soldiers without spending much money on other sets. in this way, you will save much more. i understand the concern of star wars battlepacks from your country. but in my country, star wars battlepacks are priced much much higher than the castle battlepacks. asuka, on may 26 2008, 01:38 am, said: thanks, whitefang! castle battle packs.... simply wonderful! finally a dream came true, well done tlc! asuka, i agreed with you totally. this is indeed a dream come true! batbrick, on may 26 2008, 06:59 am, said: thanks whitefang! i love this battlepack, but can only really hope to get one. still, great accesories and a spider! that's great! batbrick away! batbrick, you must get one of these packs. i am sure it will help you in your batman medival mocs. there are many possibilites for you to play around and custom with your mini-figs. this battlepack, and of course crown battlepack too, will prove useful to you. edited by whitefang, 26 may 2008 - 02:41 am.

-1 no offence- make this 7.99 can. too expensive to be coming with only a few figures. 20$ earns you the same amount of figs, plus a catapult, barricade, two horses and a jousting divider.

0 whitefang, although i realize that the battle packs are great specifically for building armies, and castle accessories (which is why its such a shame that i won't be able to buy these things ), while sdpirate's sets are more for a catapult, calvary whatever. the fact to the matter is with the battle pack you get: 5 minifigs with lots of accessories. while with the sets that sdpirate showed us you get: 5 minifigs with an okay amount of accessories 3 horses (including two skeleton ones) a ballista a weapons rack, and a jousting barricade. you cannot say that the battle pack contains the same amount of stuff that the other two sets have and therefore should be priced the same. it just seems that lego is ripping off canadian army builders, to me if the battle pack contained a small catapult, or wall so that it contained about the same amount of stuff that the other sets had it would be fair. it seems stupid that you will only get minifigs from one set, while you can get about the same amount of minifigs plus a bunch of other stuff from two other equally priced sets. thats why to me these battle packs are a rip off, because of what they contain, imho the battle packs seem to be only worth about 10 dollars.

0 thanks for sharing these close-up images of this battlepack whitefang. i actually had this set in my hand at legoland cal. and could not decide if i wanted it. i'm currently out of "castle-mode" with my large indy jungle set up on the table, and creating ghost train mocs that are starting to line up on the bookshelves. once i buy the troll ship, i'll want to start collecting these great fig sets. thanks again for sharing.

0 sorry to be going a little off topic here but personally i have just bought 40 crowny battle packs for the only reason that i am running out of space to store the left over blocks. about 500 of my crownies came from sets (mentioned above) on sale which would have been cheaper than the battle packs. thanks for the review whitefang but i dont think i will be buy any skeleton battle packs, that army is large enough.

0 for those of you who buy so many of this and the other battle pack with crownies, what do you do with all of them? is this simply to create a large-scale army, or do you plan to build large castle scenes with all the figs. i'd love to see some pictures (on the "share your castle army" thread).

1 hi gang! as you all know, indiana jones iv has just debuted, and tlg has released a set depicting the incan temple (7627) from the film's climax. but lego beat harrison ford, george lucas, steven spielberg and company to the punch by nine whole years with johnny thunder's adventures in the amazon ancient ruins. the vitals: year of release: 1999 parts count: 453 msrp: $80.00 the set included eight figures: (from left) two skeletons, dr. lightning, gail storm, gabarros, achu, johnny thunder, and seor palomar. on the far right is my new sigfig, el conde voltio villar. construction begins with dr. lightning and his jeep. it's a sturdy adventurers-style vehicle, with fatter tires at the rear for better traction. next is gabarros and his unusual boat. the hull is from belleville/paradisa sets, where it is usually pink or white. tlg ought to have put it in the pirate theme, as it is a nice, intermediate size. in this set, it is a small steamship. the temple is built on modular 8x8 green bricks which fit into square holes in the baseplate. this is the "treasure room." this square has a nasty double-spear trap. careful... this is the top section of the temple, crowned by achu the (mummified?) incan. more modular sections (these are from the front of the temple site, across the river from the main building). el conde: "you are too beautiful a woman to be wandering alone in the jungle, miss storm. please, allow me to accompany you." gail storm: "i'm with johnny, and i have a cutlass." el conde: "i'll be on my way." here's the finished temple, with all parts in place. now for the traps... "hmm, a giant ruby to bring home to the king." "uf!" "that was embarassing. miss storm saw me fall..." "and now i've fallen again!" "i had better rest here before something worse happens." "chispas!" "that's it, i'm leaving this place!" "why me? why?" the verdict: this is a fine set, a set whose bare parts/price ratio does not accurately reflect the intricacy of its design nor the rarity of its parts. i had to buy replacements for some of them, and let me tell you, they are pricey! that green baseplate? $14. the little dark gray saucepan near the fire? not available on bricklink at any price. the brown boat hull? vhtf. with this set, parts quality trumps parts quantity. and the minifigures are wonderful! there's not a dud in the bunch with the possible exception of the very common dr. lightning, and even he is not bad. when you factor in the coherence of the color scheme and the brilliant traps, it is obvious that 5986 is a classic. 10/10 edited by whitefang, 27 november 2008 - 05:33 am. this review is added to the index.

1 i've always wanted to see this set close-up voltio. thanks for sharing the image review. this is the only jungle adventurers set i don't have and it's got some great unique pieces (esp. those leaf brick pieces). what's great is they're not stickers. this is a really a nice review of a neat set; with the extra little humor you shared. thanks again for taking the time to photograph and share over eb.

1 thanks for this great review, voltio! i never knew of this set 'till now, and it really looks great! i never paid much attention to those aztec/incan style sets, which i now regret. i love the bright colours used here, and all the great traps, there's so many of them, which is exactly what we can expect from an old incan temple like this one. i'm surprised there's no catapult. anyway, the minifigs included are also great, and am i right in guessing those bricks are printed? that would be fantastic, as they look amazing. that boat hull is new to me too, although i guess the fact that it's mainly in belville sets explains that pretty well. thanks again for the sweet review, do you have any other jungle adventurers sets you plan to review? ~peace

1 i've always wanted this set, ever since it came out in '99. i have never seen it close up (unless you count driving over it in lego racers 2), so thanks for the pictures and the great review. voltio, on may 26 2008, 04:43 am, said: el conde: "you are too beautiful a woman to be wandering alone in the jungle, miss storm. please, allow me to accompany you." gail storm: "i'm with johnny, and i have a cutlass." el conde: "i'll be on my way." hehe.

1 a real classic, thanks for that nice and funny review, voltio! a well designed set, very playable with a lot of nifty traps, a very good use of that raised baseplate and really nice crafts. the mf charactersre excellent too! and although the color schemes great and original, especially with all these neat printed pieces, its perhaps the only part of that set that looks a little out of date today.... nevertheless, the sets plain charming and shows clearly that tlc dont need licenses to do some distinct adventurer sets.

1 great review. i saw the instructions of this set, but never atracted me until now a great set an a excelente review.

1 thanks for reviewing this rare set! since it came out in 1999 i have only seen this set in a toystore one single time, one single copy as well... it was in the summer of 1999 in belgium (arlon) in a store called 'maxi toys' (belgiums tru, i think). they had the three biggest junglesets for sale there: these ancient ruins, the set with the beautiful black boat and the zeppelin. being into adventurers at that time i had never seen the entire jungle theme (not even in a leaflet or catalog) and surprised as i was i bought all three sets. that was one happy dutch boy in belgium! surprisingly the two smallest sets made it in very small quantities to my local stores in holland (except for the pontoon plane and small raft which was my very first shop at home order). the spider's secret i bought off bl, which makes me the proud owner of the entire jungle serie. back to the set: this was the first time in a long history of collecting lego that i had a deformed piece: an 2x8 red plate was twisted, i twisted it back and it still serves it's purpose... i loved the whole steam-idea in this jungle serie: the two boats both (including the one in this set) had nice steamengines and a very cool mechanic (yours has the wrong hat/hair btw) to come along with them. the skeleton falling down on the end of a chain was the most intriguing part of this set for me, it worked really well and when you were done scaring minifigures you could winch it up again ready for the next go. the only thing i did not really like about this set was the difference in wheelsize on the car, front small, back large and the way the palmtree consisted out of just three parts... all in all a great set that is becoming more rare and expensive as we speak/post. get it! edited by simonwillems, 26 may 2008 - 07:59 pm.

1 great review! i just barly missed the jungle series, growing up with half a year of jungle and mainly orient expedition and dino island. i like egypt more, but this set (despite the 4x4 palm tree) is practically perfect. i love the detail and vibrant colours. gotta say, i've got a thing for pippin reed myself. by the way, what does "vhtf" mean? edited by sdpirate, 28 may 2008 - 01:06 am.

1 vhtf= very hard to find. to answer some earlier replies... no, there are no stickers in this set. while some adventurers sets of the era had stickers (the 5956 zeppelin had tons), all of the interesting mesoamerican designs from this set are printed. also, simonwillems was correct; my mechanic is missing his hat, which should be a black kepi. they're extremely expensive on bl, though (proving once again that this set has some awesome parts), so i ordered a replacement from lego. it's in the mail and should come soon.

-1 the printed pieces are the real gems of this set. beyond them, there isn't much to this set, though the boat hull is nice. the model itself, isn't all that great. the new akator temple is definately a superior model (at least in piece count), but those printed pieces are hard to resist. steve

1 i absolutly love this set. this is in my opinion the best adventurers set. it has it all; the falling bridge, the falling skeleton, the spear trap, and the classic trapdoor. it is a must-have set. thanks for providing such a nice review.

1 i just rebuilt this entire set today, and the nostalgia was totally worth taking bits and pieces from a few of my own mocs. only now did i realize how rare some of those pieces are, and i'm rather thankful that i have all of the printed pieces, and achu. the only pieces i am missing is a transparent orange headlight (3 out of 4), black minifigure hammer, light gray chain(replaced it with a dark gray chain), and one whole minifigure, which is the mechanic guy. i still have both the instructions and the box, and both are in appalling conditions. kudos to the pre-2000s lego sets like this one! love 'em

1 wow, good review! i used to love this old sets, as i was greatly fascinated by inca and aztec cultures, and the mayans technological marvels astounded me. i was thrilled to death when lego released little aztec figures, so of course i jsut had to buy some your narration with the sig fig was hilarious, and the review was all around wonderful, keep up the good work mate!

1 thanks for the awesome review voltio. el conde is the man!

1 i got this as a birthday gift when i turned 7 years old or so. i can still remember the big box with the brown bridge in its display! so many hours of fun. one of the most amazing sets i own. a lot of play value. a true classic!

1 i had one of these! it was awesome, it went well with the zeppelin. i can't remember if the box was one of those fold up the lid ones though. can't tell from the picture. anyone want to jog my memory, i always thought the sets with the flap lids were the best, i kept those! edited by giantdinosaur, 26 september 2011 - 08:38 pm.

1 haha, i love seeing reviews where sigfigs and minifigures from the set present the set! i'm looking foward your next reviews! :d

0 the images are obsolete, please fix it.

1 welcome to cardinal brick's review of 7736 it's a small set but as i bought it the other day i felt that it probably did merit a short review. the box is ofcourse far larger than necessary! there's plenty of air inside. the contence is one bag and the instruction booklet, you could proably build it inside the bag if the desire took you. we have one new coastguard with the slightly stubly head found in the castle range and a trans-clear visor. the build was challanging and arduious the final product is quite nice at one ?3.00 it's a good set only 50p more than an impulse set and with enough extra parts to justify the increase in the price. a good set for a little gift or so on, the buggy moves well. there's not that much to say really for i can't really think of additional models to build with the parts but then what do you expect for the price. edited by cardinal brick, 26 may 2008 - 06:47 pm.

1 thank you very much for the review, cardinal brick! that's indeed a very nice little set! klaus-dieter

1 i recommend this lil set, it's a nice small set, and the vehicle does roll well. i'm sure many young builders would love it

1 great reveiw this is definatly one of the cg sets im geting i cant wait to get my hands on this set!

1 great review 5150 lego! the new camera was well worth it. youve got everything well done. im looking forward to your next review. meschepers, on may 27 2008, 06:22 am, said: wow. i was skeptical of this coast guard line. though getting to see some detailed pictures of this set i really want to get get it. same here. maybe in two days i can see it in real.

1 this has gotta be the coolest chopper ever. i love it its so accurate plus your review is great because it shows all the inner details

0 thank you very much for the nice review, 5150 lego! the helicopter is - apart from that it is very, very big and that it does not include any interior - a very nice set . the most i like the life raft becuase it is simply . nevertheless i don't know if i buy it (probably not) - but it's very nice! two questions : -where can you fasten the stretcher on to haul it up and down? -is the motor working with batteries? klaus-dieter edited by klaus-dieter, 28 may 2008 - 09:19 pm.

0 great review, 5150. although, you might want to resize your pictures before posting them so they don't take forever to load. quote wow. i was skeptical of this coast guard line. i was actually the complete opposite. ever since i saw the first pictures, i fell in love with the whole line. the helicopter looks to be one of the two best in the line, right up with the 4wd and jetski. great job tlc, and i do hope you have something equally as great planned for next year.

1 very nice job on the review 5150!! i definitly like this set much better now that i have seen good pics of it. i am definitly picking this up as soon as i can. again, great review . model on!!

1 great review! i will get this, but i will wait for a sale. edited by ~vbbn~, 28 may 2008 - 10:54 pm.

(as long as you don't have anything to heavy) one detail i forgot to meation is the shark. its nothing new, just the basic shark lego has had around for nealy 2 decades, but it was a detail nothing less.

1 nice review! the helicopter reminds a sikorsky chopper,isn't it?

-1 i could tell from the pictures that a lot (maybe all) the designs on the raft were stickers. in the whole set are there any printed parts besides the torsos or is it all stickers?

-1 all stickers i'm afraid. though i'mnot a fan of stickers myself. some sets (like ferrari for example) take longer to put on than building the actual set. this one is not as sticker heavy as it seams though, and the ones that areon there really give the set that extra touch. printed would have been preffered of course, but in this case i didn't mind it.

(...) btw, which jedi has an orange eta 2? i guess it should work with mfs.... hmm.... i think its count citrus....

1 thanks for the review! this set looks great and i really wish i had the money to buy the entire line. but unfortunately, i don't. i love the way tlc used the wing parts to the jedi interceptor for the life raft - very well thought of. anyhow, great review!

1 what an outstanding copter! i love it. the orange looks fantastic. this is probably lego's best copter to date. thanks for sharing the review. i would definately recommend that you downsize your pictures a bit though.

1 i will certainly add this one to my collection, i already own every other rescue helicopter and i have a feeling this will be the best. just love how its completely enclosed, thanks for the review.

0 thanks, and yes that is a new torso! soon the 7886 wil be reviewd! who want's the second riddle? edited by ???theriddler???, 28 may 2008 - 02:11 pm.

1 this looks like the best of the new bat sets. it was also in the movie; don't know why they didn't make it sooner.

1 thanks for the nice review, ???theriddler???. a neat and funny ice cream truck and a pretty detailed yet perhaps a little big tumbler. an overall cool set for sure!

0 thanks for the review riddler. your pics are a bit blurry though, if you want them a bit better you should sit your camera on a hard surface so you don't wobble it as much i love the tumbler, though it is quite massive, but either way i'll be glad to get it. the figs in my opinion are really bad, joker should atleast have a different suit. oh well, it's worth it for that awesome van, and instance where the stickers are totally worth it. thanks again! batbrick away!

0 thanks all, but so little replies , but my hq is sent now, i'll hope and think the set wil be arived tomorow! who want's the second riddle?

-1 ???theriddler???, on may 29 2008, 02:54 pm, said: who want's the second riddle? bring it on, oh mysterious puzzler.... perhaps it could help a little if you would resize the pics for your next one, with all that automatic resizing going on it needs quite some time for the site to load.... in this context, to see two pics of your clock was perhaps a little odd too....

1 great looking set, loved the review, pictures were good... sometimes blury but i think i will pick this up after i get the rest of the kotcs sets. riddler a tip i learned in photoclass is to take a breath in and hold it while pushing the shutter so you don't accidentally move while breathing. i thought it was silly, but it does work. again great review! looking forward to more...

1 ???theriddler???, on may 29 2008, 12:22 pm, said: oke thanks for the tips, but you see that not blurry pics, i've taken them later, so now it will be totaly great pics! who want's the second riddle? excellent review! this and the other four batman sets are must buys.

0 uncle joker's cheap technic missile surprise great review, however, there isn't much appeal to the set after you see what the "surprise" is, though i can modify the truck to have an evil gas-ice cream making interior

-1 the stickers ruin the tumbler but the truck is very good if it was cheaper id get it

0 i am gonna have to pick this up, what a grand representation of the tumbler and it would be my first joker minifigure. my lego bat-life is looking up! )tnr(

1 thanks for the review, ??theriddler??! i am going to see if this set is at meijer, and i will buy it if it is. and i am reviewing the harley truck right now, and i will post a review later.

1 nice review m8. shame that most of the pictures are blurry but nonetheless. just wanted to say that out of all my lego sets, this one, 7888 is the best. the tumbler is so cool once it is put together! those four huge wheels at the back make it quite unique! if you do not have this set i highly recomend it. edited by 4olic, 30 august 2009 - 02:59 pm.

1 thank you for clearing that up i felt that it was ok to review an old topic, as stated, rather than just go ahead and start a new one. a shame that this set, as all other batman sets, have gone up so highly in value but still all things considering (general after market lego price hikes) it is still a wonderfull set even with its market value today (that is if you can ignore the mrsp).

0 i too thought the joker's van was the pleasant surprise of this set. the tumbler looks good yes, until you see it in person... it's grossly oversized. they should have made it closer to a regular car size (like the movie), because this one is a monster.

1 sinner, on may 28 2008, 02:35 pm, said: care to explain why? the mcm has a pure weight of parts that i find hard to quantify but love... it is just so dense when you build it, full of nice surprises, no technique required, and a wonderful stearing mechanism that i rank as more important than the suspension of the mars version. this thing was meant to crush anyway, who needs suspension? i also like the way you never felt that the m-trons deserved a base after building this, it was that good... the colour scheme was perfect... it's space and i like it... enough said great review btw god bless, nathan naturally you're entitled to your inferior opinion...

0 fun review, thanks! kinda sad to think that with tlc's recent ban on magnets in their products, we'll never see an m:tron revival ...

0 i love the design of the front canopy of this set, but i always felt that they could have done more with the rest of the model. this set is good candidate for customization though. there is quite a bit on unused space inside, especially in the middle section. i want to try putting a technic-style engine into mine at some point, along with the necessary gearing. i got my mcm brand new off ebay some years ago for a pretty good price, but the box was very worn out and the big trans-neon panel, which floats freely inside the box, was a bit damaged. as for the hose/jetpack things, i always assumed that they were either welding torches or flamethrowers. take your pick. quote kinda sad to think that with tlc's recent ban on magnets in their products first time i've heard of that. what are they going to do for the train couplings?

1 joebot, on may 28 2008, 07:31 pm, said: kinda sad to think that with tlc's recent ban on magnets in their products since when is that? the new train couplings have magnets, only with a special casing. anyways, m:tron is one of the greatest space factions, with mega core magnetiser as my favourite set of these guys (even though i do not own it ). the only thing that bothers me is the lack of (reachable) controls for the minifigs to drive their vehicles (but iirc it is the same with a lot of other space-sets as well)

0 fluyt, on may 28 2008, 01:56 pm, said: since when is that? the new train couplings have magnets, only with a special casing. you're right, i should have clarified -- it's the old loose magnets that apparently are being discontinued, not all magnets altogether. as you noted, the new train couplings still have magnets, but they appear to be permanently attached to a fairly large housing, which i guess will prevent kids from eating them. but the old m:tron round magnet pieces are presumably discontinued.

0 sinner, on may 28 2008, 11:35 pm, said: care to explain why? personally i think that aside from the colour scheme the new one is far better. why? suspension, more enclosed cockpits, bug-like appearence.... i suppose it's a matter of personal opinion though. i just thought that the mt-101 was very skeletal and couldn't really steer that well, although i do like it. also the mcm has a better design, in my view, as the wheels are closer together, making it look a lot more tankish than the mt-101. also space in the rear isn't wasted on having a shuttle. cp5670, on may 29 2008, 02:52 am, said: as for the hose/jetpack things, i always assumed that they were either welding torches or flamethrowers. take your pick. hmm.... well they don't have much else to defend themselves with, and i think in the uk the mcm was marketed as a mobile recovery center. fluyt, on may 29 2008, 03:56 am, said: anyways, m:tron is one of the greatest space factions, with mega core magnetiser as my favourite set of these guys (even though i do not own it ). the only thing that bothers me is the lack of (reachable) controls for the minifigs to drive their vehicles (but iirc it is the same with a lot of other space-sets as well) yeah they could have used the normal levers instead of the pronged two piece things at the front of the cockpit. but there is certainly a lot to mod. joebot, on may 29 2008, 04:25 am, said: but the old m:tron round magnet pieces are presumably discontinued. shoot... guess that bl and ebay are the only sources now... thanks for your input!

0 it looks like you're right about the old magnets. i got a few off pab two months ago but they no longer have them. i guess i should grab some while they're still widely available on bricklink, as they can be useful in a number of situations. on a side note, one interesting thing about this set is that it seemingly had two us/canada names, mega core magnetizer and multi core magnetizer. brickset, lugnet and all the other sites i've seen call it mega, but i have some north american catalogs from that time period that call it multi and the box also says multi on it. i actually didn't know the mega name at all until many years after the m:tron line.

1 harley & mistah j. i want to preface my review by admitting that im an unrepentant harley quinn fanboy. ive been enamored with the character since she first appeared in batman: the animated series back in the 90s, and ive since followed her misadventures through her introduction into the regular batman series during no mans land, into her own series, and even on the short-lived and not-so-good birds of prey tv show. so please excuse any pro-harley bias. so, down to business. the 267 piece set retails for $30 us ($35 at toys r us) and builds up very fast and easy. it consists of batmans bat cycle, harleys hammer truck, and brand new batman and harley quinn minifigs. there is also no lack of weapons. in addition to the usual bag of bat-accessories and guns, the set also comes with a pair of gray revolvers. batman in this set has the new armor torso print and the hips are the same color as the legs, hinting that this is supposed to represent the movie style batsuits more so then the traditional comic book underwear over tights look. harley quinn is a very cool looking minifig, and i havent grinned so much at a new batman character figure since my first batman minifig a couple years ago. the figure is very true to the character, and the torso has been accented with a few shape lines to try and distinguish her as a female despite the boxy body. harleys jester cap is an interesting new piece. it seems (to me at least) to be made of a slightly different grade of plastic then were used to. its molded in red and painted with black and white, and it comes packed in its own separate little baggie. i expect that this piece may have cost lego a little more then usual to produce. harley also has a buildable accessory, a giant mallet. sure, she cant stand up all that well unless its held in specific ways, but its neat and most importantly, its funny. its especially fun for smacking the everloving crap out of other minifigs with. the bat cycle is in bag number one and is a very fast build. this isnt some little japanese sport bike like nightwings cycle. this monster is almost a car and seems to pack just the right amount of intimidation for the caped crusader to exploit. thanks to the thick tires (two in front, one in back) it stands up just fine on its own and rolls very well. the huge exhaust pipes are a nice touch and give the thing a look of engine power. the only real flaw is the inclusion of the flick-fire missiles mounted on the sides. but, as with any lego model, they can be easily left out without hurting the look of the vehicle. the hammer truck is the bulk of this set and a lot more fun then it looks. of the monster truck persuasion, the vehicle is designed and built with a surprising level of solidity. the axle mounts are particularly impressive. the big wheels and tires just beg you to drive this thing right over the bat cycle (or batman). the mega-mallet gimmick is also a surprise. not so much for its technical complexity, there isnt any really, but for the fact that once you start turning the knob at the rear to swing the mallet back and forth, its really a lot of fun. there are some low points to the truck design. again the flick-fire missiles are tacked on and theres a cargo crate/bed set into the back for harleys loot of jewels. the crate would have looked a lot better molded in black. in brown it breaks up the look of the truck a little. speaking of which, the look of the truck is very pleasing. the red and black harley quinn color scheme works really well on the vehicle. there are a few stickers here, and unfortunately, the diamond patterned ones are applied over multiple bricks. the rest, however, are great. not only does she have an i love joker bumper sticker, but she has a joker playing card taped to her dash, i guess serving as a picture of her beloved puddin. there is also a sticker for activation of the hammer, which boldly shouts hit me! this is a fun set. a neat new batman vehicle and a big truck with lots of playability. the harley minifig is a must-have for any bat-fan and, if you only get one of the batman sets this year, id recommend this one. the price versus piece-count on this set is a little bit of a deterrent though. this might not be the best set for collectors on a budget or people looking for something completely new and innovative, but anyone buying this for a child can rest assured that the kid will get your moneys worth out of the set through its play value. when added together and averaged out, the pros and cons of this set combine to give it a score of out of 5. even if harley herself is a clean 6 out of 5

0 darn you! making us wait like this. meanie.

0 why must you taunt us?! just kidding, can't wait for the review and to see a detailed view of ms. harley quinn! ryan

0 why!?

0 looking forward to the review, this looks to be the best of the new batsets. funnily enough, it took me a while to realise ms quinn whacking deino was not on the boxart batbrick away!

0 i scream clone, on may 29 2008, 01:00 am, said: guess you have to get in before someone else does the review! you got it! more then a few times i've gotten halfway through the whole photo, editing, and writing process only to see someone else post something before i'm fully done. so i've learned to call dibs

0 review...hurry! quick! you've got us on the edge of our seats with suspense!

0 thanks deino! btw, i told my psychiatrist to send you the bill....

0 monday my review, i hope you like that one also! but i can't wait for your review. who want's the second riddle?

1 i bought this set too, didn't get a chance to put it together yet. but the harley fig is awesome! anyway, looking forward to your review.

-1 quote looking forward to the review, this looks to be the best of the new batsets. *gasp* are you kidding me? honestly, i hate this set. the batbike looks far too blocky, and that hammer truck looks super shoddy and thrown together. the only real reason i'd get it at all would be for the harely quinn figure - but i'd probably just get her separately on bricklink. besides, the tumbler and robin's jetski sets look far better to me. they actually seem to have great vehicle designs. no new villian figures, i know, but still some great old ones. er, wait a minute... oh yeah, hope your review gives the real scoop on this kit, deino.

0 thanks all, i hope my hq wil arive today, and deinonychus i don't wanna do stupid to you but must i do also a review of the hq set, i want to do that also a review of hq without the blurry pics. who want's the second riddle?

1 harley, the fig, is amazing. love that hat. batcycle, meh...ok. truck: flick fire missiles!!?!?? lego have you no sanity! sure they're great but you're putting them on every single action set!! hammer thingy; win. nice truck! great review!

-1 so, down to business. the 267 piece set retails for $30 us what? but it's 30 in the uk! why, lego, why?

1 my set has arived! and i have build it, what a nice thing! anyone want a review for me? without blurry pics . who want's the second riddle?

0 the '08 batman sets look like a step up from the somewhat lackluster '07 sets. this looks like a very fun set with a whimsical sense of style very fitting with harley quinn's character. the price isn't great, but i guess you gotta pay for that batman logo. on the downside ... i am so over the good buy vehicle vs. bad guy vehicle concept. i really wish tlc would get over this. you see it throughout the product line -- batman, castle, mission to mars, etc.

1 thanks for the review deinonychus! this is an awesome set, it may just be my first batman set

1 awesome! i am totally getting this set. good review!

-1 great review! though you really seem to like this set, and it probably is a great one, i'm not a fan of the penguin sub, or at least i'm not from what i see.

1 brickadier general, on may 29 2008, 07:27 pm, said: hi all, so i was at "the wal-mart" yesterday and had the munchies and was looking for something to eat. somewhere along the line, i stopped caring about food and decided to browse the toy department to see what they had lego-wise. thank you very much for that neat review, brickadier general .... im glad that you changed your mind, a review of a burger wouldnt be half that interesting for sure. its just a mediocre set to me, but of course its always cool to get important mfs in less pricy sets. i like the penguins sub from the batcave more, just because they did a fine job on resembling a penguin without using a sticker.... robins craft looks fairly nice, but the most useful parts of the whole set, for me personally, would be those indeed very neat green engines.

1 yay, another technic shooter!! whew, i need a spare one in case the 14,348 other ones that i have all happen to break. seriously, do lego set designers get some sort of bonus for incorporating catapults, technic shooters, and / or flick-fire missiles??? anyway, thanks for the review. looks like a cute set.

1 thanks for the review! i love this set, i didn't think it was much at first either, but i really love it. another cheaper robin and penguin is great, and those nifty mini penguins are awesome. the spare pieces are even nice! i love robin's little scuba jet, those green engines are very nice and i love it compactness. penguin's sub is even better, at first i was annoyed at getting two subs but now i realise it means i can have a fleet of them i'll be sure to mod over those cannons though, but the details are very slick. thanks again. batbrick away!

0 thanks . why isn't this set on s@h? who want's the second riddle?

1 i was never considering getting this set as i don't really like batman, but if i found this set and had some money with me, i would buy it! ii would use it for indiana jones or something, and the revolevers and top hats! the only problem i see with the box-art is that the penguin is drowning!

-1 looks like a cool set, but the hairpiece for robin is vary disapointing, i would be so glad is they used the regular hair you see all the time. i hope lego will not make a habit of using that hairpiece on other figures.

1 man i was hoping to be the first to review, ordered from tru 2 days ago. oh well this set looks sweet, can't wait for your review.

1 man, tohse mini vehicles and minifigs are sexy as all heck! i love dr.inferno and the female pattern for agent trace (is it just me or she almost "busting out"? ). i love the dr. inferno hair, and the reappearance of spy-clops and gold tooth is simply gold (yes yes, pun intended!) i have to say this is shaping up to be one of my favourite sets, well, ever! batbrick away!

0 can't wait for the kick @$$ trailer review :d

1 you know i like many had doubt's about these sets when they were first mentioned, but i've decided i want the whole line now! this set is the crme de la crme. just beautifully stunning! that is a great review svelte_corps, you have gone into fantastic detail and description of all the elements. really it is this review that has persuaded me to buy this set. i blame you! the minifigs are great, the vehicles are better, and the truck and interior is awesome! the few minor draw backs are far outweighed by the attention to detail and the many unique and cool elements used in this set. and printed pieces! that is even better! great job, you have obviously put a tremendous effort in making this review, and i for one definitely appreciate it! i am looking forward to these sets being available in new zealand!

1 must. get. two thanks so much, this review has truly shown this set as a brilliant one. even those who hate this theme must admit it is greatly designed. i love the way the mini vehicles fit. i love the light brick. i love the truck front. i love the trailer. i love the missions bay. i love holding cell. i love everything! edit: and i second dragonator's response when i say thankyou svelte-corps for this grand review, you have convinced me utterly to get this! batbrick away! edited by batbrick, 31 may 2008 - 10:49 am.

1 wow. like others have said i was unsure about these when i first heard about them but then looked at the first leaked pics and thought they actually look pretty neat. now i have seen all the reviews i have to have all these sets. at first i was thinking they would be great as parts packs but the more reviews i see the less i want to use them as part packs and just keep them as built (or buy 2 so i can do both !!) can't wait till they hit the shelves in the uk...... thanks for the review

1 wow! great review of what seems to be a great set. i love that ponytail. this looks to be a must have set! (it probably won't stay together for long though...) thanks very much. (i fixed the header for you; that's two you owe me. the other is for making me think that this set was in australia... )

1 svelte_corps, a fanastic review of this biggest agents' set. at first, i was not very keen to have this set. however, after reading your review, you have make me swing up and down. its simply fabulous! thanks for your hard work. i am sure it's not easy to do this review. i love that female mini-fig. she looks awfully sweet especially with her new hair. great job!

1 thanks for another wonderful review, svelte_corps a very fine set indeed, i absolutely love the way all of the vehicles fit into the command centre, very clever. the projector is really cool, it looks very nice. it's great to see these light and sound bricks in the agents sets. all of the little nooks and crannies in the centre are great too, i really love the amount of detail featured, mixed with all of the playability of this set. the minifigs - as usual - are brilliant, the uniforms look fantastic. dr inferno looks especially great, i love his white suit with hints of orange, and who can forget his hair? i'm really tempted to buy this beast now, though i'm not sure my wallet will forgive me for it. i suppose i'll have to cut back on indy and castle multiples for now... thanks for the truly great review, svelte_corps, nice work

1 wow this set looks so amazing! amazing! genius! da'vinci art i say! you've done an excellent job reviewing, and really, this is the review i've been waiting for. so cool! so classy! i love the mission briefing feature. to think that lego could go so high as to put something ingenious like that in there! too bad lego figures don't have fingers to make shadow shows, eh? genius! the jet lauching feature is pretty slick, and they even put a control center in there too! that's beast. loving that. the bottom...i don't see how that big buggy can get out or in there, but, awesome too! the back of the truck could use more detailing i think, but the jail pop-open feature is pretty cool, as is the speed boat storage rack. cabin; it's great! that roof opening feature is a great part of this set. also i think you can have multiple figures up there...maybe you can mod it to put a bed in there! it certainly looks big enough! inferno plane, wow that think is smooth, baby! i love how the wings contain rotors inside of them!!! that's awesome detail right there. that is a sweet ship thingy, so slick. the rest of the command center is pretty awesome too; we get a 4x4 wheeler and a crane, and lots of room! wow! just wow! great review, great set! you are well worthy of your custom title! i'm gonna go buy this for only $90!!!! woot!

1 woah, i got to have this set! i shall buy it asap! thanks for the review! expertly done.

1 splendid review! i love everything on this set. no question 'bout it. somehow i knew i should have saved up and buy that when come to tru...but the sight of turbocar chase and jetpack pursuit was to tempting to pass up.

1 wonderful review - one of the best i've ever seen on this site. man, we thought this might be the weakest set in the line, but it turns out it may be the strongest! everything about this set - from the color scheme to all the details to the minifigures to the piece selection - is just wonderful! i think this set has finally confirmed it: agents is everything alpha team wasn't, and is how they should have done a spy theme from the start. kudos to tlc for finally getting it right - and i sure hope there's a second year!

1 wow, excellent review, thanks. that set sure looks fantastic. it's incredible how much features they've managed to pack in while keeping it roomy. i'm really impressed by the quality of the design. tlc is sure getting back on track with great design. ow... 2008 is going to be expensive...

1 excellent review by an excellent reviewer on and excellent set. this theme really does seem to be one of tlc's best. edited by plural, 31 may 2008 - 03:24 pm.

1 wow...i can't believe i thought this line was false...oh crap...sweet! i need to get this!

1 i first i thought the whole agents line would not be very good. but boy have i changed my mind! this set looks amazing, as do all of the other sets in the line. i really like how the small vehicles all fit into the truck. i don't like it when sets come with smaller vehicles and don't have anywhere to store them, so they just float on the side. that light projector is fantastic! i can't believe they are actually printed! this is definitly on my to-buy list! thanks for the amazing review!

1 7645 - mt-61 crystal reaper piece count: 600 price: $aud79.95, 49.95 euros (in most countries), 39.99 gbp, usd 49.99 it's happened in the wider world, and it had to happen to lego - yes, the 80s are back. space invaders, holograms, compulsory seat-belt wearing legislation, and the return of classic space. ok, we don't have a fully fledged classic space theme back yet, but if 7645 is the way of the future, i think lego is ready to do it properly. i wasn't a huge fan of last year's mars mission sets and only picked up a few on clearance, but this set is light years (excuse the pun) ahead of 2007's offerings. this mining vehicle is solid, compact, and well-designed. it looks impressive, and even better, it has fantastic power functions operability! behold 7645 - mt-61 crystal reaper! (ps i wasn't joking about the holograms or seat belts.) part 1: box, instructions, dsss (dreaded sticker sheets), parts front of box: back of box: 2 x instruction booklets: dss numero uno - for the reaper dss number two - apologies for the blurry pic but i wanted to capture the sweet shimmy of the metallic holographic background on this sheet the way it catches the light really makes a difference to the small alien craft and makes it look much more interesting from the plain stickers of last year. there's heaps of spare silvery stuff once the stickers are applied for those who use the leftover sticker material for customising. parts bags - 4 numbered with one extra with larger pieces parts everywhere - woo! i know the lego instruction books scold me if i mix bags, but i'm a devil-may-care kind of guy. in your face, tlc. i love mixing all the parts together before i build, it reminds me of my youth when the days were long, anything was possible, and i didn't need strict instructions not to build on grass or poke my eye out with a technic shooter. interesting parts - these may or may not be new, my technic knowledge is not that detailed. the little scoop parts are so cute and have a heap of potential uses. i love 'em. they're like smurf hats at miniland scale. these technic wheel things in orange are also cute. they kind of remind me of marigolds. giant fabuland marigolds! the track pieces - you get 70 of these - here's the section of track for one side - as you can see it's about 52 studs long. these hold together better than the small ones on the hailfire droid/ jungle cutter. part 2: minifigs, small mining transport, alien ship i have to confess - i forgot to take an individual snap of the astronauts . it's the usual bunch though - scaredy face guy, sunglasses in space man and a third one i can't remember. you don't really care, though? you're only interested in the alien commander and his matching arms/ legs combo deal. as brickbitz noted in his review of the smaller set, the glowy eye is just a 1x1 cylinder. the set also comes with 2 normal jellies - one pictured here for size. you'll see what happened to the other one soon enough... the alien craft is nothing exciting, apart from the gorgeous glinting stickers. here's the road safety angle. the commander actually clips onto a 1x2 plate with handle so he can't fall out! then the lime tentacle thing descends on top of him to keep him firmly there, like a baby seat. not very brave for an alien commander, is he? i mean, did darth vader ever use a seatbelt? tssk. with cradle up: this part of the build also includes the small astronaut mining buggy - small and effective. (please note in this build i've applied stickers to everything bar cockpit pieces.) this comes with radio and saw piece. part 3: the reaper! the first part of the build is the detachable shuttle. i really like the retro aesthetic of this with the angled wings and the side hoverpod things. it is much better than the comparable vehicle from 7699. the new flickfire piece is a waste of space - it's fairly limp. i prefer the simple flickfire technic pin to be honest. there's also a very nice little side workshop as you can see. i really like how the control unit is 'plugged' into the wall via 5 1x1 round plates (third pic, it's a bit dark). great detail. [the technic pins on the back are there to connect the power functions battery box. it's odd they're included at this stage of the instructions - maybe the intention was to release it originally with all the necessary motors etc but the price point was too high and they scaled it back] the base. the shuttle sits on that bley technic axle in the middle when the reaper is fully assembled. the little vehicle scoots down the ramp at the rear, which folds up to hold it in place when the reaper is in motion. you can see there's a crystal container here as well - another nice small detail which i found the 2007 sets lacked. there's also an alien here - thankfully not in those horrendous trans-orange tubes so prevalent last year. the complete assembly. isn't it snug? it's just the right size too - not massive but large enough to be a serious mining vehicle. the ominous black treads contrast nicely with the white/ orange colour scheme of the vehicle itself. the trans detailing - blue for weapons, neon green for energy - is carried nicely through the whole set. the blades and the scoops whirl nicely as the machine trundles along. top down view: tread detail: whirling blades of death! the buggy descends: probably the most disturbing aspect of the whole set is this pic: the jelly has an orange pump plugged into its heart which is connected to an energy supply on the left hand side! this vehicle runs on alien jelly juice! either that or it's milking the jelly in some equally disturbing fashion. how amoral is that! i know there's been debate about this - the jellys aren't innocent, they're evil energy crystal thieving maniacs etc - but i find it a bit odd that the humans respond by chaining the jelly up to the bowels of their mining vehcile and suck energy from its heart. people debate about violence in lego as represented by realistic minifig weapons, but i think the moral lesson here is even worse - it's ok to exploit foreign life forms for our own gain if they treat us badly first! (who-fans, i think the ood should have a word with the jelly commander ) that aside, this set is well-designed and fairly good value at $aud79.95. it's definitely a notch above last year's mars mission sets overall, with improved detailing and more useful functions. the holo-stickers are fab and it's nice to have an alien commander, even if he is a bit bulky and his fingers are identical to his toes. however, if all these reasons by themselves weren't reason to recomend this set, the following is.... part 4: power functions the best part of this set - and the reason i bought it, really - is the integration of power functions. bizarrely this isn't mentioned at all on the box and i only found out about it from the instructions when they were posted on eurobricks! (instructions for book 2 which has the power function stuff available here.) this is a great idea and hopefully we will see more new sets take this kind of approach (especially with the new train sets). luckily i got monster dino 4958 on sale for half price earlier this year so already had most of the necessary motors etc - the only one needed was an extra small one. what you need is listed in the instructions below with redirections to shop @ home to buy the motors. note there's actually a mistake on this page. the 2 small motors you need are both 8883 not 8882 (which is the large xl motor). way to confuse the kids there, lego! attaching them was a dream and only took a few minutes (in contrast to 4958 where it was almost impossible to remove motor elements without dismantling the model). basically the back platform and some plates and orange slopes come off, you attach the motors, and then the smaller plates go back on. these parts are now left loose: overall the look of the reaper isn't badly effected as you're mainly viewing from the front anyway: sadly i can't show you how it moves, you'll just have to trust me that it does ! the way it is steered is demonsrated in the instruction pages above. basically each motor is controlled by a corresponding switch on the remote. move them both forward to move forward, move one right to turn right, move both back to move back etc. it zips along! it's a speedy little thing! personally i wouldn't want to be in it's path as it comes roaring down the martian canyon! (my cat was scared as it was.) it is oodles of fun and definitely worth trying if you have the motors or can get them cheaply, and adds a whole new dimension to the 'play' aspect of 'playset'. it is also as i said very quick to switch between modded and non-modded reaper in contrast to the more fiddly dino creations. the only problem i had is that if it moves too fast, the weight of the battery box at the back tends to pull the whole thing back and it rears up. it does correct itself though. i only trialled this on carpet last night so it may behave differently on other surfaces - i will need to experiment! part 5: summation this is a great set made even better with the addition of power functions. at $aud79.95 it's well-priced. buy it! buy the motors as well (k-mart still has stock of 4958 at $89, wait for a 15% off sale)! you won't regret it. buy 2 and make competing battle machines! the only thing is... just don't torture that poor jelly edited by sinner, 24 june 2008 - 03:25 am.

1 wonder full job, but now my wallet aches in misery.

1 im not that into mars mission... but this set reminds me of the jungle cutter

1 great review. i just got 7644 mx-81 hypersonic operations aircraft. it's a great ship. i started to review it, but then it started to rain (i was outside), so the review is coming tommorow. technicolor stickers! very pretty!

1 you really are an awesome set reviewer, svelte_corps!! thanks very much for this sweet review, so in-depth and detailed, that is one sweet vehicle! it's got three of my favourite things, treads, orange, and big slicey blades! thanks again! ~peace

1 another great review. i'm looking forward to getting this set sometime soon. i wasn't aware of the power function aspect, similar i suppose to the old technic sets which had an additional instructions for those with the relevant motors. i knew those dino's i got at clearance would come in useful. nice to see the recent "bulldozer" treads appearing in black. grey seemed a slightly unusual colour choice.

-1 this set looks 10 times sweeter with the power functions, too bad i'll have to buy some extra.

0 nice review the power functions is a nice idea and i ownder if it will appear in any other new sets? regarless if i get this (i decided to just to get what ever looks good in the shops from now on ) im defianltey picking up some of the white visors off bricklink

1 wow, this thing is very cool. definately no lack of details, and is quite cheap for the bang of the set that you get. for some reason i really love the bay in the back of the detachable ship. quite an improvement from last years line. thank you for the review.

1 i was going to buy this set anyway, but now i'm even more excited. :d my favorite part of this set is the bay that holds the little cart vehicles.

1 thank you for that fine review, svelte_corps. thats a pretty cool set, much more solid than the armoured drilling unit, with a nice little transporter and some for sure pretty interesting additional power functions. a very smart idea indeed! did i miss something or is there really only one (and probably improved) shooting device? and therere even some levers to control the vehicles.... wow. a matured marsmission on indeed! now lets get rid of these poor utilized jellies and were right on the way....

0 so, is there some way to get all those motor bits at once, or do you have to buy them on their own? i don't think i've ever seen them in a store here...

(if people have the ferris wheel set as well i think the small motor comes in that.)

0 this should be reported to the news .

1 well i guess its nice that they're making the story background a little more clear. with that jelly plugged into the power cable... hmmh, both jellies and crystals can be used as power sources, think theres a connection? both of them are transparent and greenish... maybe jellies hatch from crystals like eggs? or need them as food? or something important like that? yay for evil humans.

1 thanks for the great review sveltecorps. i bought some of the mm last year and ended up selling them off for sw. this new set has got me interested in mm again, partly due to your cool review! one question though, did you get this set in aust shops or s@h, just wondering if i should be looking for it yet? edit: sorry just saw your other post saying it was ordered from s@h cheers isc edited by i scream clone, 04 june 2008 - 08:08 am.

1 excellent review. loving. this. set. i mean, come on, it's a flipping tank! awesomeness is written all over this - from all those blades and scoops at the front to the mini rover. and yes, you can even turn it into a motorized battle tank! reminds me of the old technic days when they advertised in the manuals how to hook up the kits with separately sold motors. another day, another review of an awesome set. yes, this is sure tlc's year!

0 algernon, on jun 5 2008, 02:03 pm, said: why is it that agents and star wars get their own news articles but this fantastic set is totally ignored? i think maybe there's a bit of star wars excitement on the front page which has probably got a few members frothing with excitement. not every review needs to be frontpaged anyway .

0 no, but this is one of the most anticipated sets of 08...

1 i appreciate your review mr. mandalorian, but why the negativity?. i'd try to find more positives about the set instead of kinda criticizing it after each picture. i personally think it looks freakin' awesome!. the size is very impresive and i nearly fell of my chair when i saw the first pics earlier this year. it's quite unlike anything i've ever seen from lego. edited by radiant7, 04 june 2008 - 08:27 am.

0 thanks for the review. i really like all the mars mission sets this year. the usage of the big wing is a bit annoying, but you can't blame lego for re-using the mold. i've been considering doing the same with mine! mr. mandalorian, on jun 4 2008, 02:19 pm, said: so, that's all folks. shall i include one last "bar" joke? i wouldn't have a bar of it...

-1 thanks for the great and very detailed review. i love the new holostickers! i'm still not sold on this set though. i'm not sure why... i think it's the big wing piece and the too-technicy build (from looking at the instructions). the platform seems kind of out of place. and for the size of the set, the functionality doesn't seem as good as it could be. it reminds me of 7699 armored drilling unit - looks impressive but doesn't seem to do that much. i do think mars mission has improved this year though. bar none, this is the weakest of the new mm sets i think.

0 mr. mandalorian, on jun 4 2008, 01:19 am, said: and then we have this thing. what is it? defense laser? communications array? satellite t.v.? that certainly feels like an homage to the deep freeze defender... which itself feels like an homage to the galaxy commander. is there some way to centre one of the cockpit units without massive de- and re- construction?

1 i don't understand why there's so much negativity... this is actually my favorite of the new mm sets. the finished look is very sleek and not very gappy at all. the deployable landing pad is great, and it'll make it easy to put on a shelf without taking too much room. lots of greebles... although i will concede that it's just begging to be modded. still, though, i'm definitely buying this one. :) it has a really great look to it!

0 sinner, on jun 4 2008, 03:44 am, said: having a name like that is a good start! my screen name largely sums up my interest in lego, but is not soley limited to space. thanks for the warm welcome.

0 two more questions: 1 - how stable is the entire craft when balanced on the platform? is there a chance that it will just collapse? 2 - what are the total wingspan, height and depth measurements of the model?

-1 hm, needs more firepower.

0 spacefan, on jun 4 2008, 02:38 pm, said: aside from the factory star justice set (elements of which i loathe do tell. (i'm being curious, not confrontational. )

1 great review, mr. boba fett. i really like this set a lot. some of the features may not be as good as i hoped they would, but overall this looks to be a really nice set. i'm so happy that the giant spacecrafts are finally back. quote i've noticed a trend that the larger sets have plenty of parts potential but when assembled the model is not more than the sum of the parts... eagle base certainly didn't seem worth the asking price, at least this is one large model. on a positive note the lame aero tubes, darts and martian carrier pods have disappeared. hm, actually, i don't see the comparison. eagle base looked terible to me right from the start, so it was no suprise when it ended up being the weakest kit in the first year. this big ship, on the other hand, looked great as soon as i saw it, and still looks good.

1 thanks for the review. i actually quite like this. i can't afford it, so i'm not getting too attached to it, but in its own way, it's great. it's certainly reminiscent of space sets of the past, as others have said, and the drop-down ramp section is just really cool. as an idea, you understand. sure, the lab is a little crap, but at least the effort was made (sort of ). the sheer fact that it's so big though, really makes me like this. there's just something appealing about large spaceships. not capital ships, just big space ships. with lots of guns! spacefan, on jun 4 2008, 10:34 pm, said: anyway, i hope were not breaking forum protocol by not discussing the 7644 review of the original poster or that particular set in general. hey, it's no worse than batbrick and i. no, really, it isn't even in the same league!

1 thank you for that nice review, mr. mandalorian. wow. somehow its almost like classic spaces back indeed.... its a great star ship. it looks stream lined, original and impressive and even the huge plane wing part looks rather cool and smooth on it. its equipped at least with some kind of engines on top of the wings and although theyre made with only two a little 'juniorized' parts its better than nothing. theres a lab or some sort of engine room with enough space inside to allow one or two mfs to play scotty.... yeah! the two cockpitsre nicely detailed with a cool use of these orange 1x1 round plates and to detach one or all two of them reminds a lot of the playability of the good old space sets. it seems even like its easy to attach them to some kind of cloud city twin-pod car thanks these hinged wings. looks like some solid fun to me. of course.... the cockpits arent airtight and even this reminds unfortunately of the post blue, grey and trans yellow era of cs. anyway, theres no real fun without some moding i guess. another great advantage of the sets that its not overpacked with shooting things. one technic shooter, cool in grey and only one trans orange prison pod too. well, i can surely live with that especially since its nicely asymmetrical. the drill rovers very charming, a little like a rebuilt oldsmobile convertibe stranded on mars. sweet! and that platform features plain nifty and well done too, very playable and useable for a lot of things. hmm.... recently i complained a lot about the dense use of studless technic beams for the inner structure of vehicles like these exoforce tanks par exemple which makes moding (in an economical way) pretty frustrating.... but the beams herere used in a very proper way. it should be fairly easy to mod, lets say, the back of that lab section up to perhaps even the cockpits to create a larger airtight area that could be boarded from the platform.... just to fit this certain spacers need for, um, realism.... therere many more nice details too like that 'satelite t.v.' thingy and that cylinder with trans blue 2x2 dish for the knob or these cylinders with cones on that handle, and that alien crafts pretty nice and detailed as well. like i said before.... i really feel like classic spaces back.

1 nice review. just one little point. since there is no sound transmission through space, but there is an atmosphere on mars through which this this thing supposedly flies, hypersonic airplane makes far more sense than hypersonic spacecraft ;)

1 sorry mr. mandalorian, i guess i was just getting a bit defensive because when this set first appeared here, there were literally 2 pages of people just bagging out the new mm sets (but then the thread took a turn and people started to warm to them, much like the agents). i do agree that it definitely needs some mocing, but with that work i think it has the potential to be a really amazing set in terms of what you could cram into it. the lab is a little disappointing, i've always wanted an enclosed cabin space in a vehicle this size because then all the little space guys can have a true meeting place! the drop-down landing ramp is my favourite part, it has lots of potential uses. maybe it's even possible to integrate pneumatics :d

0 hello shefols and afols, as well as tfols, welcome to eb news reviews, i am your host...for tonight anyway... shadows will take over after this episode, if we make more... today we are reviewing mars impulse sets 5616 and 5617. starting with 5617 alien jet, i must say it is a small and quick build, the jellie, is made of hard plastic, which surprised me, as i had expected jellies to be a soft plastic. the jet is mainly 2x4 plates, some swingy hinges, the "seatbelt" and a thing which i cannot seem to name my one gripe about it is that the jelly cant see where he is flying, it looks better with a mf in it. there was a red 1x1 as a spare part. we move on to the 5616 mini robot, which is basically a "safe" brick, with binoculars, soem cheese slopes, little arms, and legs. the best part i must say was the metal detector and "safe" brick, as these seem to be quite rare in sets (by my knowlage anyway). the austronaut has a face, shown in dr. sinsters review. the set also comes with a pick-axe and lime green gem. extra peices where a cheese slope, a green 1x1 and a white droid arm. that concludes these mini-reviews. i also will use this opportunity to show my photo setup. both sets are reccomended, if you either need a army, or are just trying to get a variaty of figs like myself. next wee-*camera fades* edited by sinner, 24 june 2008 - 04:17 am.

-1 i didn't see this one coming... probably because that huge white beard got in the way! was this "shadows impersonates aluvar" week or something? ok, this wasn't the worst thing i've ever seen. we can try a real one in the future. the not too near, but maybe not too far future. i guess. where is that a map of, anyway?

0 hate to admit it but i enjoy staudie's humour more than i enjoy shadow's highlights include the inability to reach the cheese and the acious robot, thanks for the review! batbrick away!

0 ah ha ha! a wonderful review, stauder, very funny indeed! the cheese bit made me laugh. stupid aliens. very good once again. i hope to see more reviews in future! quick, go buy the other impulse sets, i could do with another review of them... ~peace

0 hello all eurobricks members, i will be presenting my first review on one of the harry potter's set. firstly, i must emphasize that i am not a very big harry potter fan or owned many harry potter sets. for this review, i will be highlighting what is the beauty of this small little set, and the reasons to own multiple sets of it. comments and critics are strongly welcomed. this set is featured in the harry potter movie, prisoner of azkaban. this set is orignally released in 2004, align with the harry potter's movie. this was actually one of the movie scene where buckbeak the griffin is appeared in the movie. the group of students are supposed to be having up close and personal with him. however, draco decided to disturb our lovely buckbeak. enough of this movie synopsis, i am sure fans of harry potter will know this better. box art featured mini-fig/creature background scene the scene is a simple garden, which had a very good mixture of spare parts for your mocs building. on its own, there is nothing outstanding about this set, except for the griffin. you can buy multiple sets for the griffin alone and for draco mini-fig. well, you don't need lots of draco. but for castle lovers, black cap are exceptionally useful, at least from my view. now, i will point out the following why this sets is so great for other reasons. hidden cover note that, this is the only mechanism which you can find in this set. it looks rather simple but quite useful. there are some little things hide in it too. greens, foilage and brown parts needless to say much, it offer 3 foilage, a green plant, 3 brown slopes, 2 ideal bricks and 1x1 brown brick for building a tree. great for jungle building, forest building and etc. i am sure there are many builders will look out for these. interesting parts it comes with a wizard book, owl, 2 printed tiles with a spider and stone prints on it. the far right, seriously i don't find any good use for it. can any eb members enlighten me on that gray thing on the right? grey parts it comes with a good 10 x 4 green plate. useful for adding as a platform. some more grey slopes for your mocs. there you have it, draco encounter with buckbeak comparing with deep forest ambush as you may remembered recently, there was an impulse set competition. one of my entries, which is under the history theme. the deep forest ambush was firstly inspired by this set, and made an improvement out of it. look at the improved tree compared with the orignal. summary review playability: 4/10 (not much to play with, except swooshing around the griffin) design: 5/10 (too simple and its defintely not related with the movie scene) parts: 10/10 (great for parts, explained by the review. a great deal of green and brown parts) price: 9/10 (an inexpensive set based on the 2004 pricing) overall: 7/10 (a must have for all harry potter fans and collectors whom needs a great use of green and brown parts) hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. more pictures can be found in my brickshelf (when moderated) let the potter magic begans! edited by whitefang, 09 june 2008 - 02:45 pm.

0 a very nice little review of a pretty nice little set that i wish i'd bought between 1 and 10 of. just for the griffin. oh well. your review has shown me that it's useful for more than just that, so maybe i'll try to pick one up someday. can't have too many black capes, books, or printed things. speaking of which: whitefang, on jun 9 2008, 09:41 am, said: interesting parts it comes with a wizard book, owl, 2 printed tiles with a spider and stone prints on it. the far right, seriously i don't find any good use for it. can any eb members enlighten me on that gray thing on the right? the gray thing is technically a plume, like any castle plume, except in this case it's a feather (presumably from the griffin), and made from the mold to the old indian feathers in the wild west sets. it's a case of an old part coming back for a slightly new use, in a new colour. beyond that, the "stone print" tile is a bundle or rolled up blanket or package, depending on where it's used. i don't think it's ever meant to be a stone. it was used as a rolled up pack on the back of the star wars speederbikes, for example. nice pics, plenty of useful information. i'd give this review an a+ thanks for doing it!

1 i own about 6 copies of this set!

1 this is one of the few sets i've bought more than one (2!) of. it has a really good selection of pieces, and your review really does it justice, whitefang. multiple hippogriff/griffins on! edited by shoc, 11 june 2008 - 05:58 pm.

0 thanks for that nice review of a really interesting and pretty cool set. at least, a griffin, i guess, is pretty close to an unicorn or a dragon, huh?

1 thanks for the nice review - it was one of the first ones i got when emerging from my dark ages . i bought two of these, just for buckbeack - i thought he would make a good statue in a persian temple type moc. i also liked the minifig head pumpkin and plant part in bright green - both new pieces to me at the time. all in all, it was a good castle or forest building set with a nice selection of pieces for rocks, grass, plants and trees. the dark bley plume piece also now appears in the 10185 green grocer set as detailing on the roof of the turret.

1 guys, thanks for your kind comments! i am glad that you have enjoyed this review. for this set, i think i bought about 7 to 8 sets, all for the griffins. it's used for my griffin riders in my castle collection. now, the green and brown parts come in very handy for castle mocs too. imperialshadows, on jun 9 2008, 11:13 pm, said: a very nice little review of a pretty nice little set that i wish i'd bought between 1 and 10 of. just for the griffin. oh well. your review has shown me that it's useful for more than just that, so maybe i'll try to pick one up someday. can't have too many black capes, books, or printed things. speaking of which: the gray thing is technically a plume, like any castle plume, except in this case it's a feather (presumably from the griffin), and made from the mold to the old indian feathers in the wild west sets. it's a case of an old part coming back for a slightly new use, in a new colour. beyond that, the "stone print" tile is a bundle or rolled up blanket or package, depending on where it's used. i don't think it's ever meant to be a stone. it was used as a rolled up pack on the back of the star wars speederbikes, for example. nice pics, plenty of useful information. i'd give this review an a+ thanks for doing it! i am very happy that you enjoyed and find my review useful. thanks for enlighten me. now, i know where is the origin of that gray plume. i wonder if i can use it to match with my castle knights as its plume. in addition, i mistook the rolled up pack as the stone print tile. why didn't i think of it? i must have overlook it, and used it as a stone tile instead. nevertheless, i am glad you have give me some good insights on the parts that i am not familar with. svelte_corps, on jun 10 2008, 10:49 am, said: thanks for the nice review - it was one of the first ones i got when emerging from my dark ages . i bought two of these, just for buckbeack - i thought he would make a good statue in a persian temple type moc. i also liked the minifig head pumpkin and plant part in bright green - both new pieces to me at the time. all in all, it was a good castle or forest building set with a nice selection of pieces for rocks, grass, plants and trees. the dark bley plume piece also now appears in the 10185 green grocer set as detailing on the roof of the turret. i never thought of using buckbeak as a statue for worship. i find this concept very interesting. yes, i agreed that this set offers new parts at that time. personally, i pretty like the green plant. good for any kind of terrain settings. i did not realise that the dark bley plume piece appear in the green grocer. thanks for pointing out. edited by whitefang, 10 june 2008 - 03:39 am.

1 great review. nice set for plants, huh? too bad i didnt get thus set... but luckily my neighbor did! that griffin is nice for castle mocs, and that orange head (pumpkin, i know) seems rare to me. not much else to say...

1 ohhh great idea to review the "old" potter sets! especially the line from prisoner of azkaban... i was in my dark ages then. luckily i was able to catch up on the missed figs with one internet order. this draco is the best tlc has made, if you ask me. the new one (also doubling for belloq and "guards" in the indy line) doesn't look quite as hautain as this one. buckbeak looks cool. looks like his neck/head can be moved, right? rather similar to lego horses. well designed. the orange brick doesn't have a pumpkin face on it, right? unlike the one from philosopher's stone in the set with the troll. i'm looking forward to more reviews by you, sir whitefang! good work

1 guys, thanks for your comments! glad you find this review useful! and be sure to watch out for more old sets reviews. mr spielbrick, on jun 12 2008, 12:28 am, said: this draco is the best tlc has made, if you ask me. the new one (also doubling for belloq and "guards" in the indy line) doesn't look quite as hautain as this one. buckbeak looks cool. looks like his neck/head can be moved, right? rather similar to lego horses. well designed. mr spielbrick, thanks for pointing out some important highlights for the review. i have overlooked it earlier. i strongly agreed with you, that this draco is the best tlc made. i pretty like the face compared to others. furthermore, i used my multiple dracos, for my castle armor guards instead. one could not have too many dracos. buckbeak design is well made. the head can be moved upwards and downwards. the mechanism is similar to the horse design. in addition, buckbeak wings can be removed. similar to the typical green or black dragon wings that we used to see in the past. well, the main reason for me to buy this set was in fact buckbeak. you don't often find a griffin lying around except in harry potter sets. mr spielbrick, on jun 12 2008, 12:28 am, said: the orange brick doesn't have a pumpkin face on it, right? unlike the one from philosopher's stone in the set with the troll. sorry to said, there is no print on that pumpkin face. it's pure orange.

1 i bought about 5 or 6 of these sets when they were on sale in mid- 2006. i still have a few of them laying around unopened. i think i payed like under $5 for each and thats a great deal for all the variety of neat parts you get with this set.

0 nice review. i like the treemaking pieces the most of this not very expensive set. the buckbeak fig is very nice and can bow his head like the horses. i was annoyed to get another draco without some other not made figs (pansy parkinson for example). about the dark bley feathers; in the second version of hogwarts there were several of these feathers put in little 1x1 cones like it was a feather to write with it. i bought 2 sets of these and when they were for sale i just bought +/- 6 more of it. only annoying that i had then even a bigger army of draco's.

0 i see a lot of good reviews on this site, but this one is superb! good job. tom

1 yay! the monster book of monsters! now i want this! i also love the buckbeak figure! it looks very realistic for a lego version of something, usually they are much worse (look at the goblins, for example)

1 hello eb! yes, i'm cranking out the reviews! the other day i picked up this gem for an okay sales price at devonport, tas, while searching for the new batsets. i informed iamded of this as he is a spidey-suckup ( ) and he informed me this was the only set he didn't have of the wave 2 of this theme. so i ask you great eb members to please remind him of this when commenting! here we go with the review of doctopus' lair: anyway, unlike other reviews, this stars more people, the batbrick-iamded-dragonator-daisy review! (daisy is the mouse that came in the set) first up re the figs, and i must say they are great. i love fleshies and these are excellent to expand my batman world, plus having a spiderman to beat up is good too doctopus is great, though his tentacles are annoying to keep in order. peter parker is a nice addition, i love that torso. eve though harry osborn was totally absent from this scene, i welcome him as he is a good fig also. best of all is mary jane, fleshie females are hard to come by and i love that hair, my very first one! oh, and even better is bley daisy on the far right: another fantastic thing is that by mixing mj with doctopus you get a far more deadly and real villain than anyone could've forseen - the hippy! oh c'mon, tell me that ain't cool? anyhoo, here is a pic of doctopus showing his might: random fact: did you know i influence both dragonator and iamded in their sigfigs? dragonator adapts his from my ia series while iamded added mutt hair when i had him like that in a pic i posted. now onto the box, sorry about the lighting. the art is good and the cartoon spidey in the corner may have beenthe inspiration for a similar style in the new batsets: back of the box. again, sorry about the lighting and blur, it was gtting late and these were the last pics: finally we get to the first part of the set: the catapult. is that movie accurate or what? i love the part in sm2 when he uses his homemade genetic spider powered catapult to launch himself to the scene! oh well, it does comes with a cool spider web an trans blue spider, so it gets some points: and it is really fun! i launched spidey several metres once, i don't think he ever recovered. infact, he almost certainly webbed himself slightly cooler extras are these two. this awesome little boat is great for city, as is the simple but nice bouy, daisy approves: naturally dragonator ruins everything when he found out the "dragon" that would be riding with him was our nickname for daisy now finally, the main attraction - coctopus' dock. iamded and i threw dragonator in the water to see if he could swim. he er, couldn't one sweeney todd later, we continue! the overall construction of the building is very good. i know a lot of people hated stickers and i hated applying these, but they do look spectacular and perfect for any city setting, like a bank, a gotham bank as iamded has already noted below me the black lifesavers a very cool as are the web piece and log pieces: the inside contains the neutron copperplate triple bypass humdrum holy hum 5000, which does does, see movie. anyhoo, it is very cool, and includes a little control thingy on the yellow brick next to it. unfortunately, the inside is plain but for that: the other side has no wall too which is a bit of a letdown really, but atleast it allows daisy easy access. one gripe is those yellow 1x1 bricks, they serve no purpose and break up the colour scheme: better shot of the thingy thing. i quite like it, the use of technic parts actually works, and the whole set is worth it for those purple flames and dishes alone it closes up pretty well too, unable to hit the dish which is a nice feature: me and iamded liked it so much we threw a revived dragonator into it. unfortunately it disagreed with him, but it was fun: another shot of the dock. i like how they have gaps in the jetty, i know the movie version was pretty wack, and although the set isn't very faithful to it (looks more like a seaside library to be frank) it still is very nice. this is my first large blue baseplate too which is wonderful, though funny how the set only uses about half of it: the roof is a well designed and fun feature, it uses some technic connections to render it flexible of any degree, as you can see here by my opening of it: better shot of the roof design, it can lie flat or at any angle. i might use the design myself in the future: as much as i love the building this feature bugs me, for in order for it to work this wall has to stick out, which not only looks ugly but makes you be able to see through the corners. still, easily modded, and log pieces are fantastic for mocing. it also means that there are 7 windows all up for a good, sizeable building: by pulling out the piece in the center the walls both collapss sideways outwards, which is actually pretty fun and works everytime: overall view of the set including characters: now for the story that makes no sense....at all: spiderman is dead after falling down the wall mechanism (see above): only daisy can save the day! for dragonator is being held by the evil doctopus! and iamded and dragonator are too busy not caring! and brainbox is too busy complaining that this goes against all marvel continuity! unfortunately daisy is on a lunchbreak so tough luck dragonator: and daisy goes on a search for fortune and glory: okay, this is what i think of the set: build: 3/5 - fun, but those stickers ruin the experience somewhat, and if you don't apply them the instructions are a bit hard to follow. playability: 4/5 - great little gizmos and bits, not the kind that keep you going like with the 2007 aquabase, but good fun still. design: 4/5 - not very movie faithful no, but still a great little building and a smart design for certain aspects. minifigs: 5/5 - great figs with all different faces and very useful bits. price: 2/5 far, far overpriced even on sale sadly total: 18/25 - a good set that could've been better with a few minor changes. nothing wrong with it, but it doesn't really cross the line to greatness. that said, it has a lot going for it and definitely worth buying or atleast a look! thanks for reading batbrick away! edited by batbrick, 13 june 2008 - 12:21 pm.

1 lookin' good so far! though i must say it's doc ock, not dok ock... the catapult is, well, ridiculous, but the boat is very spiffy, and the buoy is a nice addition! i actually like the stickers on the window pieces, perfect for this building, and great for post-apoc scenes. black life-saver rings are a nice addition too.anyway, hurry up dragonator and batbrick! and daisy! i want to see the rest of the review! ~iamded away!

0 great review as always, batbrick! ) i always enjoy reading them because they really make my day! )))) i hope that we shall see more and more.... good day, gentlemen! )

1 thanks for the review, even if it is a number of years late. i picked this up whn it came out, and thought it was a rather cool set (besides the catapult). plenty of cool pieces, and the baseplate has found a use in the batcave. although i think my dad managed to spill some beer on it at one point. that was awful to clean off... batbrick, on jun 13 2008, 10:44 am, said: and brainbox is too busy complaining that this goes against all marvel continuity! i wasn't expecting that! there i was, casually scrolling down, when i stumbled onto a picture of me.

-1 where is my soap????!!!! haha, anyway, nice review as always, batbrick! i too have the set and hate the wall jutting out, catapult, and missing wall. but hey, review.

0 great review batbrick, i was curious as to what the interior of the building looked like, i still think that there should have been a few random chains or something lying around as they may add to the abandoned feeling that the ware house had. though i have to admit that i really like the roof dock and minifigs as some of them make good average civilians that are somewhat hard to come by in todays sets . great comic as well it seemed to add a lot to your review, hope you can review another spider man set soon . btw as adam mentioned i believe you owe me a bar of soap, for reading your review ... edited by mack, 14 june 2008 - 12:59 am.

1 great review. the hippy and the "story" at the end were hilarious. i think this was easily the best of the spiderman 2 sets. you're right though - it wasn't movie acurate, as the actual movie dock was far shabbier and more trashed than this. ah well, i guess tlc couldn't do everything.

0 a few years late, but great review! i really want to get this set!

0 great review! i wish i'd bought this set when it came out. oh well...

1 hi everyone, please note that this review was done back in 2006, so do forgive me if you happened to notice any dated comments. product: 6205 v-wing theme: star wars no of pieces: 118 release date: feburary 2006 rrp: sgd29.90/usd9.90 availability: lego shop@home, target, toys 'r' us (us & europe), bricksworld (sg). lego.com said: rule the spaceways! the sleek v-wing fighter can adapt to any situation! position the wings and flaps in attack mode to protect palpatine's shuttle from enemies. or position the wings in flight mode to survey the area for intruders! either way, the v-wing is ready to strike for the republic. includes clone pilot and r4 droid. position wings in attack or flight mode! sorry to all for the delay, since this was supposed to be done 3 days ago. anyway, to get on with it... quite a minimal amount of baggies for this set, as noticed. and the best thing is... no sticker sheet. yippee!! :bounce: the completed v-wing. though not really a complaint, it would be nice if the entire astromech body was provided instead of only the head dome. :p of course, then it wouldn't be movie-accurate, since the q7 series astro-mech is integrated with the starfighter. :lol: he's definitely well-painted for a simple mini-fig. since even the back is painted too. i have to assumed this is the same mini-fig provided for 7259 arc-170 starfighter too, since i don't have that set. anyway, this mini-fig is much more accurate for this v-wing since his suit is rated against vacuum, while those in the arc-170 aren't . :p one thing that's lacking is the instruments panel in the cockpit... it's totally non-existent here. i wonder what went wrong during the design stage. personally... this is the second most anticipated set for 2006, the first being the tie interceptor, for me. one thing is that there's no known release of the v-wing starfighter by hasbro, nor the other well-known brands. the other thing is that being a star wars vehicle collector, i would really loved to see a replica toy of the v-wing. and the v-wing by the lego group does not disappoint... it's nearly movie-accurate, except for the cockpit transparisteel cover which could used some paint like the x-wing's. also, there's a permanent landing gear that quite neat, since it allows you to land the craft on uniform surfaces. the s-foils on the other hand can be quite a pain to pose into flight position. very difficult for the s-foils to remain symmetrical during play. the "swoosh-able" or play factor of this product is quite good... just check out the pics for yourself... :d *crackle* general skywalker, we have incoming! to conclude, the v-wing starfighter would make a much better companion to the eta-2 actis interceptor (jedi starfighter), than the arc-170. coz the arc-170 seems more like a long-range bomber to me, than a snub-fighter. :p and a final pic to show it at rest... comments (for 2008) just an updated pic to show my latest display on the clone wars hmm... off the record, i do understand that sometimes, reviews by most tend to a certain set of guidelines like naming the set, and showing the boxed, and out of boxed pics, and of course, the grading portion. regarding my review, i prefer not to grade any of the lego sets at all as far as possible, because to each, his/her own. my reasons to put up a review is not to belittle the efforts of tlg in coming out with these products nor to help them market them, but to show my appreciation and enjoyment of these products. i hope noone is offended by this, and would like to apologise for any misunderstanding that this may caused. for those who do not understand the above paragraph, care not for it and play on! like me

1 thanks for the detailed review valentin it had good picture quality and a nice little comic near the end. although this is a slightly older set it still was a good one, i remmeber that i bought two of them to build up a small airforce for the republic, and if i see another one i may buy it for use in the starwars comic game. keep up the good work .

1 thanks for another great review. i remember getting a few v-wings cheaper because the boxes had been crushed on their way to the store. not an "all-that" set, but still a fine parts pack with a decent design. kimt

1 nice review! i would have snapped this up back in 2006 if i was not in my dark ages!

0 great review! and what are the stands that you used? they look much better than the white bricks that i use.

1 nice review! thanks valentin and a cool collection of prequel fighter you have there 'want'

1 valentin, great review! nice to see you here in eurobricks. this fighter looks real neat. by the way, bricksworld pricetag is still visible in your box-art.

0 commanderbly42, on jun 16 2008, 11:11 pm, said: great review! and what are the stands that you used? they look much better than the white bricks that i use. oh, those stands were once cd-r spindles. it's from the container that can hold 100 cd-rs. hi whitefang, can't deny that they were once my fav. hunts for lego, and yes, that price tag is a tad hard to remove. well, while am delighted at the v-wing, i still kinda wish it had come with a printed brick for its instruments panel.

1 hmmm i must rebuild my sw ships [a-wing,jsf & v-wing just to name afew] nice review this is probable one of my favourite sw ships i cant belive i broke it for pieces [just to make small crap mocs] next time my friend comes over we will rebuild some of my sw ships [he always asks me if we can rebuild them so i finaly said yes ]

1 mofo jones, on jul 15 2008, 01:39 am, said: nice review, but i have to correct something for you: this quote is wrong - here's a link to the hasbro v-wing photo archive over on rebelscum.com and i have something to correct for you! valentin, on jun 15 2008, 09:53 am, said: hi everyone, please note that this review was done back in 2006, so do forgive me if you happened to notice any dated comments. the first sentence is your best buddy, my friend! anyway, nice review! love this set. dsr

0 oops. sorry, valentin!

1 yes i recommend this set it was my second star wars set ever and i must say it was a stunner for me commanderfox

1 here's the 3rd of the whole batch of complete reviews done back in 2006. hope you guys enjoy them so far. product: 6206 tie interceptor theme: star wars no of pieces: 212 release date: february 2006 rrp: sgd39.90/usd19.90 availability: lego shop@home, target, toys 'r' us (us & europe), bricksworld (sg). lego.com said: challenge the rebels! blasting out of star wars episode vi: return of the jedi, the tie interceptor is the fastest fighter in the imperial fleet! open the cockpit canopy and fold down the instrument panel to put the tie pilot inside and recreate your favorite classic star wars battles! includes tie fighter pilot! cockpit opens and instrument panel folds down! it does seem to have more pieces than the average tie fighter, but this is actually cheaper than the 7263 tie fighter. of course, there's no light-up feature in this set. :sweat: yesh!! finally... a... tie interceptor!! this is probably the most anticipated for all set for all lego tie collectors worldwide, since the fighter, bomber, advanced, and even the expanded universe droid fighter had been released by the lego group. this set is near movie-accurate, since the bottom part of it ain't. :p the cockpit and pylons uses the same design as that of the tie advanced piloted by darth vader. except for one minor change, that is the aft interior of the cockpit is strengthen this time. and this is indeed good news, since the older models had a problem of hard hinge and loose brick connection. there's no landing gear for this set, but it doesn't require it anyway. this tie interceptor balances perfectly on its wings. standard instruments panel and, of course, standard imperial pilot. the "swoosh-able" or play factor of this set is definitely very high... just take a look. :d *camera view from own craft* *camera view from tie-advanced* *combat simulation of endor's battle from the archives* no bomber, since i started late in re-collecting. :p to conclude, for a typical lego fan, this set is a 60/40, 60 due to it's good design, and for a typical star wars fan, this is a must-get. the only flaw for this set is the same flaw for any lego set in sg, the price. :doh: comment(current in 2008) being a starwars fan... no... being a typical toy collector, space is definitely a premium... so much so that i turned to lego starwars to sate my appetite for more starwars products when i already have no more display space. for the next few non-lego pictures, they are the crown of my starfighter collection in 1/18 scale. so just view them for fun, eh? and no, i haven't had the chance nor the time to do up a scene of my lego starfighters blowing up spectacularly since the pieces would be very hard to put back... hmm... then again, isn't that what lego is about. "doh".

0 why have you uploaded this twice???

1 skipper 24, on jun 15 2008, 08:02 pm, said: why have you uploaded this twice??? what do you mean, twice?? the tie interceptor is one of the best ties that have been made so far. though you're pushing it when doing a review that has already been done by a precious member of this site fine review for a great set. kimt

1 great set, but i scrapped it since im not big on space. nice set though, and a good review jifel

0 raptor, on jun 18 2008, 02:10 am, said: because this review is very good! thanks for all the pics! i want to buy that set too! they are so big! but why did lego made them in these strange black/d.blue colors? this set is very old, i saw it one time in my local toyshop for 69 euro and now it's gone, pitty. will look on ebay. you saw it for 69 euro? boy be happy you didn't buy it that's even for europe-princing a completely insane price edit: almost forgot - very nice review! thanks a lot. haven't gotten this set yet but now i might edited by vaders_son, 18 june 2008 - 12:45 pm.

-1 i picked up this set mainly because of the many (5+spare) glow in the dark parts and the promise of 2 racers and one helicopter for the price of a little more than two racers (90kr. vs. 2x40kr.) the box the back of the box shows the two alternate models you can build if the polybags rip. there are 3 cheese slopes and two 1x2 tiles that glow in the dark, where the tiles are exclusive for this set. the total parts count is high at 142, but there are no really big pieces among them. inside the box you will find the building instructions, a sheet with some odd sticky labels (thrown away) and 3 polybags marked by the bag building difficulty. the models the lime colored car doesn't bring out anything new. we have seen racers built like that before, but it does contain some nice bricks for the collection. the police cruiser surprises with an interesting design along the sides as seen here. it is harder to build because of the greater level of details: the helicopter is without doubt the hardest vehicle to build in a bag. i can't finish it because it's larger than the bag. you can't put on the top blades nor the tail of the thing, so it beats the forklift from 7733 where the top bar is the new kind that doesn't completely fit. there is also instructions for the alternate models, but it requires the bags to be opened... the vehicles are pretty standard for the racers theme with the police car being the highlight of the set conclusion i like the difficulty curve between bag 1 and 2, but the last bag should be labeled 1000000 instead of 3. it requires some inhuman skills to build that helicopter in the bag... ? lime colored car: 3 - we have seen it before, but it has some nice pieces... and lime. police cruiser: 9 - it has a massive diffusers, rare parts and a high level of details. it is a shame lego relies so much on stickers. helicopter: 6 - if you see it as a set for one fourth of the price of the cars, it is quite amazing, but you can't bag build it and i would personally prefer some more detail instead of the big size. overall it is a nice little set, but the police car is the main attraction. i wouldn't get the other vehicles if they were sold separately. brickshelf gallery edited by whitefang, 23 may 2009 - 07:03 pm. indexed

0 y'know you can open the bag

0 why didn't you open the bags?????

0 it's called challenging one's self :-p plus you can resell it as misb since it's still sealed in the polybags lol

0 there's something called opening the bag do you do this with everything lego set there's something called opening the bag do you do this with everything lego set

0 ahhh bag building... that takes me back. i suspect that if i didn't do my bag building topic my eb life would have turned out very differently. for the negative nancies, i suggest you try it. i bought a set just so i could, and i found it fun. (not fun enough to do it again though!) thanks for the interesting review.

0 i bought a tiny turbos set(a no-no for me) after i saw this "bag building." it's actually pretty fun. i built it faster than i would if i had opened the bags!

1 great review indexing it, as i write this. how come you think the ctt is the at-ats predecessor? do you mean the motorized at-at or at-at's in general? i think this is a great set and i am very fond of mine. it's one of the few sw sets of mine that is on "parade" at all times. most are packed away in the attic. kimt [btw it's not alone, the older version of the at-at is keeping it company]

0 as far as i know the at-at was a invention by general veers himself? benny

0 nice job with this review skipper

-1 nice review! i echo the sentiment that more snowies would have been better.

-1 nice review ! the "driver/pilot whatever you call him" ( ) 's helmet looks kind of odd, and why does have a long red pole instead of a kick-butt lightsaber?

0 vaders_son, on jun 19 2008, 01:57 pm, said: as far as i know the at-at was a invention by general veers himself? benny i doubt that. the atat was used in the clone wars.

0 vader had a red pole because i think it makes him look bigger and in the films i doubt it is but i think his saber might be bigger.

-1 i never got the set. it looked way to skinny. i came close to buying it for the figs but then decided not to. if you compared this one to the later one there is a big difference. this one just didnt seem proporshined with the legs and its body.

1 this is one of those sets that you just have to have, i mean a motorised at-at is a dream set for original trilogy fans and has an awesome set of minifigures.

1 10143 death star ii production year: 2005 pieces: 3441 minifigs: 0 price: 299 usd peeron.com 10143 gallery the review ph4tdud3:"ds review!!!?!!! - u 2 kewl 2 do diz" me:"yes" ph4tdud3:"kewl..do u have pix of the minifigs?" me:"erhm..what minifigs?" ph4tdud3:"the ph4t figs from the ds!!1" me:"this is the other death star" ph4tdud3:"omfg there's more than 1" me:"yes" ph4tdud3:"keeeeewl. must have!!" me:"goodbye" [pushes the incinerator button] ph4tdud3:"wut?! nooooooooooooooooooo..........." and on that note, let's start the reivew of the ucs death star ii. now this is an older set (2005) and i've only gotten around to buying it a short while ago. it took me around 2 evenings to build it and i must say that i am fairly impressed by this set. time for a box pic: the build: since i started building this huge (small moon size) set at morten's appartment, i wanted to keep as few polybags open at any given time as possible. with this set it is actually possible to have a minimum of bricks scattered over a table or two while building. not sure why, but the division of bricks in the different polybags just work very well. and that is great with a set this size - 3441 bricks. the building of the set is divided into several "build this times x". for example the upper and lower part of the "unshielded" ds are completely alike. this is difficult to see when looking at the model, but heaven when building it: and this is how they solved the problem of having the wings connected to the buttom of the death star - geniously done imo: note that in the first pic the "skeleton" is easily seen. "the skeleton" holds the x to which both the upper and lower part is "clicked" on with technic pins. also there's a steering wheel (i'm sure there's a pirate name for that ) like the one in the bottom, in the top of the model to hold the upside "wings". so after having build duplicate wings (upper and lower), the "belt" (all the way around the star) and the upper and lower part of the "unshielded" side, it was time to step back and watch the death star ii in all it's glory: such a great ucs set. now i did have a few "huh's" during the build: huh! #1 in the instruction the technic lesser-dragon-head should be dark grey, but i got it in light gray. go figure and thank you replacement parts. i've experienced this before and apparently tlg uses different colours when "out-of-stock". all one has to do is call them and ask for the right colour and it's on it's way still a huh! experience. huh! #2 again it appears that tlg changed the design of the technic axleholed 1x2 bricks. the bottom has changed and i got the set where it was mixed up between "old" and "new" version. not that annoying, but still got me perplexed as to: "am i doing this right?" kinda stressing to consider taking most of the star apart to check the remaining 231 technic bricks 1x2 with axlehole. now for a verdict: : 1: looks great 2: even my "wife" likes it - female appeal 3: it's a great build 4: the polybags work for you 5: it's star wars 6: the design is awesome : 1: it wobbles if you touch it 2: very small parts come off, if you touch it 3: parts come off when you try to move it somewhere safe 4: zero swooshability so in short (yes even shorter]: the dsii is a well designed ucs set that has a great design. like most other ucs sets, it is not meant for play - hence don't play with it. ucs verdict (the numbers) 5/10 (design++/instructions+-/bricks+-/sturdiness--/colourscheme+-) design: awesome look and great greeble set instructions: easy to follow steps with bricks mentioned hard to see wether it's black or dark grey bricks: loads of great bricks a zillion bricks of the same type sturdiness: don't touch colouscheme: grey in grey with a little touch of black need a missing instruction? then click the logo

-1 thanks for the review kimt - it comes at a... confusing time you can take off the top disk and lift it like the millennium falcon from the top now. i actually don't like this set that much. it takes about 5 hours and 15 minutes to build if you do it in one go, but the repeating sections makes this built the most tedious i have experienced. it has way too many holes from which you can see the colorful skeleton and is overpriced compared to the older 10030 isd. i remember thinking it was too expensive when it was 50% off at s@h! even the snowspeeder was "kewler" to less than half the price:

-1 hmmm, ive still got this set and i must say, i think you did a good job of reviewing it. but... overall, i hate the set, probably the worst ucs set so far (apart from the naboo fighter but that hardly even counts as ucs) from my experience. unless you really really want it and have nothing better to spent your $$$ on, in that case go for it. but in my case, it was a very repetitive build and final model was quite... well, bland, not must variety to it, if you know what i mean.for the price, i would really reccomend the ucs star destroyer, because thats a much better story..

-1 thanks for the review. eh, honestly, i though this was awful ever since i first saw the pictures. to me, an incomplete grey ball doesn't really work as a special ucs kit, for the sole reason that it's boring. extremely so. now, the new death star playset is a whole different story. they should have done that in the first place. edited by grevious, 24 june 2008 - 09:12 pm.

1 good job kimt, its a really nice set. it will be interesting to see the size of ds2 ucs compared with the new death star playset. keep up the great regulator job you are doing. morten

1 darkrebellion, on jun 25 2008, 12:39 am, said: great review kimt . i like this set (even if i dont own it) because it looks simple fantastic to display. i just have one question: the mini executor can be moved around the death star ii or its attached to that place? thanks for the review . it's attached to the ds and cannot move as such. though there is 4 "spots" where it can be attached to the ds. reading your comments on this set, i can see why tlg has been forced to put it on sale on the us s@h. i don't agree that the isd is better - imho they're exactly them same - big and grey this is a question of personal liking - which is the coolest ds or isd. not comparative. i'd still call this an ok ucs when looking at it individually, but there sure is a lot other ucs sets that would get a better score than 5/10. kimt

-1 i also don't feel this is a very good set. but is that old grey? in which case it would be a nice part pack... dr. brick

-1 thanks for the review kimt! honestly, like the others have said, i don't find any appeal in ucs sets, especially this one. it's just a big, incomplete, grey ball.

-1 the build was a bit boring and i suppose a big grey ball isn't all that interesting, but since the death star ii in the movie is a big grey ball too, i don't see the problem. i didn't think it was particularly fragile. i don't care about minifigs or playability either. a few plusses: in my opinion it looked pretty damn impressive sitting in my lego room and the construction is really clever. all in all, i actually liked this one, but perhaps i have a different expectation of sets than most of you. sets are mainly parts packs and would you look at the quantity of grey plate in this thing! (it's new grey btw). i paid half price for it at shop@home uk, which is still a _lot_ more than half price from the us, and i didn't regret it for a second. cheers, ralph

0 i'd love to get my hands on one of these, but you'd need about three jobs to justify the prices of this guy on ebay. fantastic review kimt!

0 i decided to re-read this review because i just got this set today. i dont really have a concern over the design or repeating build process because owning this set was never an option for me as i collect ucs sets... but i am surprised to see an almost total lack of positive posts. i really hope that i enjoy this build.

-1 i bricklinked it too back in the day. it was an interesting build - just thought building the "unfinished" hemisphere was kind of tedious.

0 sorry about that skipper, i added the topic after the first pic was uploaded just to make sure the pics would be in the post. you probably posted while i was editing it. and i had to go to visit my grandparents, im at their house right now. sorry if you got freaked out!

0 very nice review jim! i haven't bought this set yet, but am planning to just to get a gg fig as i don't have one already. bought an imperial landing craft instead this week as it was on sale, but after this review, gg's fighter is sure to follow soon benny

0 yesterday i buy this set,and i'm waiting for a pack! this review is very helpful! jimbutcher, on jun 27 2008, 08:34 pm, said: ill try to do the sith infiltrator this weekend. i wait!

-1 does the sliding cockpit come off easily? my friends brothers breaks everytime you touch it, but he may have built it wrong. it put me off the set.

1 yeah! general grievous starfighter will land in my house! greate set, i love decals - brown and sandy pattern... ingenious! btw. when you show sith infiltrator review? i wait... :)

1 nice work jim for your first review. i must admit the set didn't really appeal to me at first, but your review has definitely shown off the cool functions built in to this ship, well done! cheers isc

0 nice review, i bought a couple of these for parts, the only thing i dont like about the ship itself (not the lego version, it does fine) is why is the grand droid general flying around in in a small fighter like this, i prefer the battlefront interpretation witch uses it as a bomber. anyway, great review! -york

0 thanks again, you guys. dont worry, the sith infiltrator review will be up this week. my computer has viruses, but now i got firefox (complete with spell check!), so i should be able to go on the internet ok from now on.

1 great set, great review! i have it too and i am very glad to own it! it will probably be the cheapest and best way to get a grievous fig for a while (even though it doesn't come with a cape ). you guys know that you can use the new robot/skeleton arms from the castle sets to make him hold his lightsabers horizontically, right? i always have him with two of each kind of arm.

1 it's all good... but!(i know, you expected a but ) it's a rat.

1 thanks for the review. bearing in mind that the whole point of this set is to get a cheap troll warrior, i actually quite like it. the cart isn't brilliant, but for 13 pieces it's not that bad. the troll fig is great as always, and i guess the rats are always nice to get (not so much in real life though). the sets that contain the trolls have a fairly solid number each (i mean, tower raid has three!), but nevertheless i think i may have to pick up a few of these. whitefang, on jul 2 2008, 02:49 pm, said: in addition, the flick missile really works. use a little bit of force from your finger and flick it, the missile will fly. well, it certainly does not impress me at all with such playing feature. the troll's hands are going to get quite sore then aren't they?

1 its a good review but you forgot another thing. the troll needs a shiled like they used to in the 2007 castle line the sets always had shields for the minifigs and it could be better if it was 3.00 instead of 3.50 but yes it is a good impulse great army builder.

1 a more affordable troll warrior for those of us avoiding the large sets (me) is always nice! thanks for the review! god bless, nathan

1 very good, nice to see how its all played out. nice review!

1 grrr... you beat me to it! i got two of these in the mail today and was so eager to do a review of it. thanks for saving me the work. edited by wilhelm screamer, 03 july 2008 - 03:30 am.

0 hey, your review is great (as usual!!) as for the set itself - well, it's an impulse set after all - small and cheap, nothing special. well, the rat is special, hehe, for me the rat is the most interesting in the set (cause i don't have a rat). i don't have a troll warrior either, but i'm not very interested.

1 quote in addition, the flick missile really works. use a little bit of force from your finger and flick it, the missile will fly. well, it certainly does not impress me at all with such playing feature. something to toughen up kids fingers! thanks for the review, cant wait til i get this comes to oz!

1 nice review, i will definately need a few of these!

1 glad you guys like the review. brainbox, on jul 3 2008, 06:19 pm, said: looking at this is making me want to build one of the favourite sets of my childhood, 6649 street sweeper (might do that today actually). cheap. good pieces (despite the lack of a bin lid... that's just inviting disaster isn't it?), nice fig, and one of those blue brushes, which i've always loved but never managed to use. the 6649 looks lovely, and i hope you managed to restore it. indeed, a bin without a lid is inviting trouble.

1 thank you for the nice review. this set looks good. i have too many of the blue sweepthings, but the fig is nice and i didn't have this face, so i will pick up one some day.

1 wow, what a great little impulse set! i relly dig the face as well as a chance to get some cool accessories like a broom, bin (no lid....sigh) and a mushroom top (hat). a really nice review and story too whitefang, i think this guy will be joining my set of lego when he shows up in australia. cheers isc

1 thanks for the review! poor little minifig: this guy has to haul the heavy machine all the way from the depot onto the littered streets to locate some trash, but when he has finally found some and switches on the machine everything will be launched towards his pants.... no wonder he's looking sad.... a nice set though, and inventive too! when it comes to streetsweepers, i remember getting the first of it's kind on my birthday in 1991.

1 thanks for doing these impulse sets, whitefang. this set looks like it has a good number of useful parts. i dont have the minifig torso or head, nor the oar or the life jacket.

1 excellent review; i like how the new coast guard sets blare out new when you see them.

1 thank you for the nice review. the set is nice, the pieces are nice. and the grey helmet is great for an additional star wars rebel technician.

1 i really enjoyed your review of the kayak! so many little things in one set that aren't currently in my collection. i didn't even realise it came with a buoy! cool helmet, lifejacket, face, and oar, i will definitely need one of these! cheers isc

1 one of the better impulse sets imo.

0 thanks for pics. the hawk, it seems to me, lacks a cockpit, theres not even a seat to keep the pilot from falling off. perhaps it they'd redesigned it to be a backpack jetpack sort of unit using similar pieces, it'd at least make some sense? based on the other mm impluses, can we assume this goes for 3.5$usd? at that price it seems to me, that the astro fighter at 5$usd was already a superior impluse set. guess i'd buy one on clearance, for the minifig.

1 thanks for another review whitefang! this is quite a nice set actually. it evokes some of the design elements of the mx-11, while looking different enough to justify me buying it. the head on the astronaut is one i like, so even better. i hadn't realised it was that one actually. does 26 pieces make it one of the bigger impulses sets? i think i may have to get one, if not two... plus it's called 'crystal hawk'. how can that not be considered cool?

"crystal hawk", i simply fell in love with that name.

1 thanks for the great review. now i just have to have that set!

1 thank you for the nice review. this set has a very classic space feeling, so i don't care about the lack of cockpit. a nice little set with a nice minifig.

1 i like this one aswell, it has a couple of parts i need for an moc train locomotive and i don't have any of those space guys yet. and a double faced guy is always a winner in my book

1 once again, another outstanding review by svelte_corps! i am not a very big fan of agents, but this theme defintely offer plenty of useful parts. this volcano base is simply fanastic for parts usage, especially in doing up landscaping, with mountains, by making use of the brown burps. i must admit that the exterior looks real cool, but the interior looks rather empty. these orange slopes certainly make a great illustration of the larva, which gives the agents a hard time to infiltrate within its compound to save his comrade. i am quite sure, this set will defintely attracts lots of kids to coax their parents to buy it, since the bright colors will defintely caught their attention. with all those hi-tech, sleek weaponary, i am sure this is the next big thing for kids out there. well, i am not sure if this theme works for me as well. but this set defintely works well for landscaping project.

1 thanks for another great review! i definitely like this set. sure, the interior might be a bit bare, but i think that the outside of the base with all of the great lava and rocks more than makes up for it. it is a bit weird that on the one side there is nothing on the inside. but that's easy to fix. anyone know when this will be out in the u.s.? thanks again for the fantastic review!

1 droool must buy!!!!!! to svelte_corps: how on this wonderful planet, did you get that??? i thought it was coming in september!!!

1 excellent review sc. thanks for sharing. the figs are awesome. i really like the female villain - an excellent face. i also like the agent uniforms. the laser gun is perfect. it has that peter sellers/pink panther dooms day device look that i envision when i think of laser destruction. the volcano has some neat features as well, like the trans. red/orange lava. it is a bit heavy on stickers though, as are many new sets/themes. but overall, i think this set will really appeal to the kids. - a great review of a neat set.

0 nice set review i really liked the narrative for the review. i must have missed your custom base back in june, also well constructed and great story too!

1 thanks for the step-by-step!! set looks great! mmmmm, clawdette....

1 i know the word "secret" base but whats this! the base is hardly secret with a massive laser gun and wide screen sticking out it looks good, lots and lots of orange! woo!

1 i'm still keeping my money payments until july 26th ...so i won't be able to buy this set unless i get some money prize or something however, i appreciate the review, and hopefully i will get this set sometime in the near future. i just love these new cybernetic arms

1 this will be a wonderful set for a mustafar moc

1 cool set. i got that firearm thing straight away lol. i might get a few of these sets and combine into mustafar. great review

1 i didn't exactly know where this belongs the best but i think it fits the best in here cause it's somewhat space related. i got this nifty little set yesterday from an auction ebay, new and sealed! i think the rock raiders theme was a great theme, and i wish they would have continues id back then. but anyway, let's see what we got here: set nr.: 4910 name: hover scout number of minifigs: 1 number of pieces: 39 release year: 1999 first, a picture of the little box & instructions: a general overview of the set: and here we have the lovely (?) miss jet! (yes, the minifigures had odfficial names in this theme ) the little vehicle: and finally the crystal analysis station. i like that very much, even if it's simple, but it does a good job and the amount of equipment also is cool: that's it, little set, little review, but big fun. i can recommend that to everybody, it's great for the parts, and the minifig is lovely. gets a 10/10 from me

0 excuse me but..what?

1 woo! rock raiders! only the best theme ever! (that's right, possibly even better than castle `07!) cheers for the review metalandi, hopefully you can inspire others to see the greatness of rock raiders too! i love how everything was so simple, yet so effective. it was loads of fun to play with and build the alternate models when i was younger as well (and probably still is ). do you plan of doing any other reviews? or do you have any other sets? rapid rider is another great small one, adding a bit of diversity with a water-based vehicle, and you get the bandit minifig. or you could get the rock raiders set, and get all of our spelunking friends (don't make me name them all ). or, if you want a slightly bigger set, loader dozer could be the way to go, axle's a pretty cool minifig too, and you get a rock monster. sorry if the last comments were detracting from your review, don't think i didn't like it, becuase it was great! i really hope you can do more! oh, and yes, my torso does come from a female fig... ~peace

0 great review and such a nice figure! i consider rock raiders space too. i also consider many of the diver themes space as well... i've yet to own a rock raiders set. i have tried to buy a few off ebay, but they always went too high...

0 sinner, on jul 20 2008, 04:56 pm, said: i consider rock raiders space too. i also consider many of the diver themes space as well... me too. the rock raiders are very sci-fi, with the best lego space storyline. the aquazonies would be inner space rather than outer space though, but they look very 'spacey'. edited by shoc, 20 july 2008 - 07:45 pm.

0 this set looks like a dandy. is the darth maul fig any different in respect to the torso or head design to the original?

0 jimbutcher, on jul 10 2008, 09:44 pm, said: a hidden compartment! now this was a very cool idea by tlg, a secret compartment found by taking off the top slope of the hull you're supposed to slide the front of the hull off, rather than lift the top piece off.

-1 i'll be honest - i don't like this ship at all. it's one of my least favourite ships in the pt and i have to yet buy either one of those sets. i also found it funny that this set was meant to be a walmart exclusive yet never appeared on the shelves at my walmart. anyhow, thanks for the review!

0 led zeppelin, on jul 10 2008, 04:46 pm, said: you're supposed to slide the front of the hull off, rather than lift the top piece off. yeah, i was looking at the construction booklet and it reminded me of that (i forgot about it), but that makes it more fragile.

-1 a very neatly designed sith infiltrator, though i think it lacks the size of the older version. a fine ship, but not what i would call a sith infiltrator. it should be bigger. thanks for another fine sw review kimt

1 hey all! so i purchased the remaining three agents sets i needed, and saw that there was no review up yet for this set! heres the first batch of parts, and the first instruction bits. the mini figures. the first small vehicles. heres a mistake that i found in the instruction booklet. there is no difference between steps 2 and 3. the team inferno boat. this is a nice chunky boat, that looks fairly heavy duty and evily. its nice to see the smooth disks on the bottom, that lego seemingly havnt done in recent boat/plane sets. and the agents submarine! this is a nice build aswell. nice and long, with a few hidden compartments. one for missiles. a place to put the treasure! some final shots of the completed set! the spare bits! another special mention has to go out to slime face. i think he is my favourite ever lego character. the detail on his unique torso is brilliant! his head is fantastic! and his costume just looks great, with the black and green (plus green is my favourite colour!) check out the back of his torso, with the slime pouring down! deep sea quest was 34.99 price ; 9/10 - this is a pretty reasonable price for a fairly substantial set. parts ; 8/10 - a lot of nice bits, few nice boats bits, and a lot of smooth disk things. minifigures ; 10/10 as i said slime face is my favourite lego character, and the details brilliant! vehicles ; 8/10 both very good, with some interesting features. build ; 8/10 a pretty fun build. overall ; 9/10 its gotta be, if just for slime face alone, but this really is a great set!

1 he does look a bit different though...although it hasnt come out well on the photos, there is some green printed slimey bits on his head aswell. he honestly is amazing.

0 great review. i love that slime face !

1 thanks for review...(i hope svelt corps still reviews it ) slime is pretty cool, i knew about the torse for a while but its no less cool now

0 nice review rezourceman, i wanted to see one of this set. it seem's there isn't much to it other than what it looks like in the official pictures, but i may well get it. i like slime face!

-1 great review, rezourceman! your pics really show off the sub well and it's good to see the build in progress. i also have this set but i didn't apply stickers to the sub as i was planning to reuse the nice dark blue pieces. however as shown in your review they do brighten it up a fair bit. i can't say this is my favourite agents set; the boat is a little oddly proportioned and the sub, although retro looking, has practically no interior and would be difficult to customise to put more in (unlike, say, the clever job batbrick did with the penguin sub in his review). the sub kind of looks like some jules verneish sea creature - i would have liked it if they'd gone all the way and made it some kind of giant robot jellyfish or squid i do agree with you about slime face - he has a fantastic torso with all the slime dripping down which is a bit obscured by the air tank. it's really encouraging that in the last 2 missions we've had great extra villains added in. the only thing i would add about the octopus is that the glow in the dark plastic is mixed in unevenly with the aqua blue, so it doesn't glow in the dark evenly - it's kind of like the mars mission jellies in that respect though much cooler! thanks again for the great review!

0 i can't see the pics over the glare from my awesomeness!! thanks for the review rez!! i'm jealous you got to snag this right away...

0 thanks for the review! it's great to see detailed pictures of slime face. the set looks good but not as good as some of the others in this line. great review!

0 i feel like a n00b asking, but what is the usd price? i didn't see a price in the review.

1 great review. this set totally owns alpha team deep sea. the sub design actually looks like a sub, the figures are way better, the acessories are better - everything is better! agents may have my vote for the best theme of the year. quote i wonder if it will last longer than one year (unlike other recent one-and-done themes). oh don't worry - a second wave will be coming next year. this was confirmed by both legomilk and in an interview with an agents designer.

1 wow, thanks for the review, that is one awesome set, slime face is excellent! i must add him to the collection, i think we need some new agents, there's so many inferno minifigures now... maybe next year? thanks again!

0 great review i just thought i'd comment saying thanks because if i had'nt found this review i'd of never made an account on eurobricks!

1 this is a great little set. i like how it combines two very different color schemes for different parts of the model. i have made some slight modifications to mine, adding a roof on the vehicle and a back wall on the outpost. also, those white 1x1 headlight plates at the front are thinner than the modern kind and seem to be quite weak. i got this set off ebay a while ago and one of them was broken in shipping, even though the set was otherwise in display model condition, and the other one broke off while i was building the set. i replaced them with the newer variety. mutex, on jul 10 2008, 11:37 pm, said: my only complain about this set was that i found that the wheels where too small , i had some trouble passing the rover over the little "craters-mountains" of the space plates the only bad thing about this set is the name. it can't even roll over a single plate's height. not very "all terrain" at all. edited by cp5670, 11 july 2008 - 07:43 am.

1 thanks for another informative review of the best lego theme ever, and not in attempt to hijack your thread but to add to it, here's a pic of my blacktron 1 version of this beautiful set. the 6927 has to rate as one of the best 5 classic space sets ever along with 918, 6970 and 928.

1 give me an excuse to sneak into your house, and let me have a feel of these classic space sets. i never had a chance to have any experience with the classic space sets. through your recent reviews on these, it gave me a wider perspective of space. i loved to play space as a child such as the late classic and futuron sets. back to the review, this 6927 is a great mobile command center vehicle suitable for all kinds of harsh terrain in the unknown space. the 6 big wheels are real solid and firm back in those days. transparent blue windscreen at the front, is wonderful. i just love these parts, especially when it's in blue. 4 computer printed tiles. aren't lego so generous back in those days, when printed parts are more commonly available unlike now. it's a real nice set. however, there is one thing i don't understand about this design. why is the driver seat has a wide back with no cover behind? and, the command center has no door at the back? i understand that these space guys are always carrying their helmet around, for oxygen supply. i wonder if there is a better answer to it.

1 dovchenko, on jul 10 2008, 08:24 pm, said: no more of your great reviews? why? a good review right here, got into the thick of the set without becoming boring with an absence of pictures or not having enough text. i've exhausted my collection of classic space sets. i'd love to keep them going, but just one more set. you can check out this index for a complete listing and links to each of the reviews. thanks for the feedbback. mutex, on jul 10 2008, 09:37 pm, said: this is one of my favorite space sets of all time. i even had 2 of them back in the days. my only complain about this set was that i found that the wheels where too small , i had some trouble passing the rover over the little "craters-mountains" of the space plates it is a gem in the classic space collection. the playability is great! i agree with you as i never thought this was much of an all-terrain vehicle with the wheel construction. the bottom of the vehicle would always touch the bottom of non-smooth surfaces. the wheels do need to be bigger (but i still like them). cp5670, on jul 10 2008, 10:43 pm, said: i got this set off ebay a while ago and one of them was broken in shipping, even though the set was otherwise in display model condition, and the other one broke off while i was building the set. i replaced them with the newer variety. great buy on this one. what did it cost you? hewman, on jul 10 2008, 11:11 pm, said: not in attempt to hijack your thread but to add to it, here's a pic of my blacktron 1 version of this beautiful set. that's excellent. i love the alternate color scheme. great job here! whitefang, on jul 11 2008, 12:11 am, said: however, there is one thing i don't understand about this design. why is the driver seat has a wide back with no cover behind? and, the command center has no door at the back? i understand that these space guys are always carrying their helmet around, for oxygen supply. i wonder if there is a better answer to it. yes. the extra space was probably for the oxygen tanks on the figs. it makes taking them off a lot easier. as for the lab/control center, i never had an issue with it being open. i think this was just for playability. one could always "pretend" that some sort of invisible force ray closed the side when activated. great comments! i love hearing what others think of these classics.

1 oh man, this review takes me back! i got this set when i was 8 years old, and loved it. i remember modding it to remove the lab in the back, and i put in a giant laser cannon instead. 'cause when you're 8 years old, everything needs a giant laser cannon. cp5670, on jul 11 2008, 12:43 am, said: the only bad thing about this set is the name. it can't even roll over a single plate's height. not very "all terrain" at all. ha! very true. the vehicle is built so low to the ground that the front end catches on everything.

1 i've always associated this set with 6929, the voyager. they're of the same timeframe and more or less the same style. 6927 is without any doubt my favourite ground vehicle of space. it was pretty simple, but it was such a creative set. the stories you could tell with this model... g... most defenitely in my top 5 of space sets...

1 awesome review brickster! i didn't you are also a space fan oh how i love classic space the all time perfect lego space related theme everytime i see one i want to buy them more and more, when compared to modern fang dangled sets with detailed figs and cool new accessories, they have nothing on classic space, simple beauty maybe its the blue/grey/trans yellow color scheme classic space forever edited by piranha, 30 august 2009 - 07:51 am.

0 wow! that brings back memories. i have that model too (in storage somewhere). the pictures are great. i will definitely be checking out more of your reviews.

1 thanks for the review! the interior looks nice, better than i expected, lots of great parts but, as you say, so many of them are stickered. after rocket ride, the stickers in the sb sets seem to have gone crazy - the early sets weren't slathered in them. 2 new figs though is most welcome.

0 great review! i want that set, mainly for patric and the spongebob with the bandage. but: why does bob have full length pants? i thought he wore briefs?

1 lots of yummy pics in the review thanks! hmm a double sidied minifig, with a painted top! thats the first time i have ever seen this done!?!? this is a great set and has recieved as evideneced by a lot of "is it new" questions, is sponge bob sets available in auzzi land? i have not seen them in shops... regards cpt. pb

0 cpt. pegleg blockbeard, on jul 12 2008, 04:23 pm, said: is sponge bob sets available in auzzi land? i have not seen them in shops... regards cpt. pb generally not, although as a special sale promotion target has 3830 bikini bottom express and 3831 rocket ride available now (although the sale starts 24 july for 20% off) and k-mart briefly had the krusty krab set last year.

0 i ordered the set via s@h and it cost 34.99 in germany, 37.99 in belgium and 50$ in australia. it looks like its a exclusive set, but without the 2limited edition" sticker on the package. in the usa its not aviable, now. i think it costs as much as the rocket ride (30$). @ mrs pegleg: he has the same, short pants, like in the other sets.

1 wow, that set looks better than i thought! i just might get it if its under $30 usd. i love all the details inside, and it seems to have a better interior than the city hospital... and the new figs look nice...

1 thanks for the pics, this set is necessary for each spongebob-fan, it looks so great

-1 the fish doctor is supposed to have a new torso.

1 ronan nissen, on jul 15 2008, 07:09 am, said: the fish doctor is supposed to have a new torso. says who? i think the one he has is fine...

0 i never have buy a sponge bob set but this looks so cool so maybe... (just maybe) i will buy it . i am curious of why tlc havent done the flying dutchman ship, it was in the first rumor list of sponge bob sets, that surely will be a must .

1 awesome, light blue train doors. yummy! it is quite strange that spongbob has become the best source for train parts: the baby blue doors, the orange round windows ,...

1 the official name for this lego set is "the emergency room". i have all the other spongebob sets, including three krusty krabs, two bikini bottoms, as well as one of everything else , now all i need to do is wait until next month to buy this set if i find it at my local toys "r" us. that spongebob minifig looks cute.

0 this set doesn't have much playability, but the hospital is better than the one released by lego recently. it has more detail. i like it.

1 thanks navy trooper fenson for the review - good one ! i really like that sb is printed! i will need to get this one when i go to the us in two weeks. copmike

1 nice review, nft! im not that much into spongebob, but these two pieces just for themselves are interesting to get: container cupboard 4532 and cupboard drawer 4536 the latter not being sold for the last 6 years! both together are an excellent way to create detailed interiors. 6 of those for me, please!

1 there's a lot great pieces in this set, i would be willing to get the set just for them. thanks for the great review!

-1 i recently bought this set for my daughters birthday. it's the first belville set that i've bought for her so it's a bit of an experiment. the house is 5 rooms and it's made up of mostly large pieces. there still is a decent amount of normal lego in it though. the doorways in the house align when it is opened out. starting with the bathroom, included is a shower, toilet, sink with vanity and a baby potty. the mirror sticker is one of the few that i put on. the open plan lounge/kitchen/dining room is well appointed as well and it has a nice glass table and coffee machine. the kitchen chairs are fabuland parts... and don't work really well. it seems they are having jellyfish for dinner! the clock is the only printed part in the set. upstairs is a baby room and the master bedroom. the radio and the tv (not shown) were stickers to my disappointment. up top is an extra room suitable for reading. (those antenna things were made from spare parts by my daughter. i have no idea what they are supposed to be... ) there are some stickers that go on the back, but i didn't put them on. as it is the set looks ok this way, but since it is a dolls house it doesn't really matter. i do think though that the fireplace should have been given a back. the bbq is made from normal parts and is quite effective. i think it uses the same light brick that's in the 4998 stegosaurus set. my kids were using it as a torch before my grumbling ruined their fun... like all belville sets, the highlight is arguably the accessories. i'll be borrowing a few of these from time to time... here is the controversial baby catapult. as you can see, it works ok, but lego probably should have tried a bit harder. we also bought for her 7583 playful puppy. it also comes with some nice accessories, but not enough to justify buying unless you want the rest of the parts. poor puppy; where does he sleep? here is my daughter assembling it. she made me make the house though as she wanted to play a game we bought her. (note the lego drink bottles! ) i didn't take any photos of the figures as they don't seem to be anything new, but i can if people want me to. at the time i was in bit of a hurry as i took these before bed so i wouldn't be stressed if the kids broke it the next day. overall, these sets seem overpriced to me, and hard to justify unless you actually want a buildable doll's house. (which we did.) it's still too early to tell if my daughter likes it or not... but at this stage it seems she lost interest in a few days. she does tend to go back to toys though. edited by whitefang, 23 may 2009 - 07:03 pm. indexed

0 mommy and daddy are naughty!

0 yay! it's good to see your kids get to build some stuff too, sinner . all through the review i was thinking 'this was a present - but who actually put it together?' so i'm glad the last pic cleared things up as for the set - it looks much bigger than i expected - i think it does make a good sized dollhouse. there are a stack of nice pieces in there - cupboards, oven, trans-blue 2x5 bricks, all the accessories, plants, flowers, food, the light-up brick, the pink roof slopes - but not enough to justify the $aud129 retail price. maybe on sale i'd pick it up and resell the belville figs but david jones hasn't even had a regular 20% off lego sale for the whole of this year that i've seen. i think the playful puppy set is a horrendous ripoff for $aud20 though. i agree with the baby catapult - the range is terrible. lego just isn't trying any more, is it? at least they've moved on from throwing cats off three storey buildings. 2 questions though. 1) was it a fun build? 2) are those large figs anatomically correct under their frou-frou finery? if not, what the hell are they doing in the second pic whilst baby sylvia explores the oven?

1 excellent review! it's nice to see how... it's nice to see how ... ... it's nice ... okay, i can't get over the sex in the bedroom and the unattended baby crawling into the oven. i didn't read anything else except, where does the puppy sleep and my daughter made me build this. you are sick and twisted and that's why i love you! it seems you are coining the belville edge. now will you please stop sitting around eating clams and get that baby out of the oven or make the fun in the bedroom a three-way? please! thank you ps. ok, i read it. i want the baby toilet and i think the jellyfish is supposed to be a jello-mold. i bet you knew that. the fireplace lattice look like the harry potter one and not the fabuland one. boo!! wienies. when your daughter outgrows it, will you turn it into a belleville star wars moc please? thank you in advance

1 great review, and i note something like a bucket in the dog set... shame its not blue... as for the fire place piece i love it and i want one, ever since finding it on mlcad!!! i love the bbq, it looks so good!, you know i might even buy this, it it was not so pink! now as for the kiddies, in ovens, make sure they are not over cooked they can be stringy , and as for the couple up stairs, now we at least know what you do with your mini figs when no one is looking/ lego sets in public places , just following your name sake i guess and i must say lego, shame, shame, that catapult needs reviwing, hardly even make a dent in a castle wall! regards cpt. pb

1 nice review, good to see your almost letting your kids play with your lego i like the functionality of the baby catapult, its good that they include some working features in a build this big! are you not showing the figures because its really hugh hefners playboy/belville mansion? i dont see the grotto though, must be an add on set like the poor puppy! its just so darn pink

0 great review sinner, i haven't seen a bellville set review before! i just realised what you meant by 'fore' in the topic subtitle, too. imperialshadows, on jul 12 2008, 09:31 am, said: obviously, it really is all about the accessories, and it's got 'em, but not enough to make me spend that kind of cash, and i don't even mind having a pile of pink parts around. i agree, a lot of the pieces are good but i don't think i would get it. however, i do think i will get the set with the dogs, so my minifigs can have giant mutant hounds! jimbutcher, on jul 12 2008, 06:45 pm, said: and look what you found... a bucket! a bucket, in disguise as a watering can...

0 shoc, on jul 12 2008, 12:20 pm, said: a bucket, in disguise as a watering can... bucket, pale... same thing. its can be called a watering pale...

0 jimbutcher, on jul 13 2008, 12:38 am, said: bucket, pale... same thing. its can be called a watering pale... this reminds me of that popular tv game show in the states: identify the bucket vs. the watering pale. no one's won the million yet...

1 sinner!!! you know, i had never seen a belville set in any review with such great pictures before! i just can't take my eyes off, in the master bedroom. the scene is quite, a little hot. enough of me, peeping up there. let's take a look at the interior. i am very surprised by its construction of the house. it's quite big and is nice of you to buy a great sweet gift for your daughter. i am very sure, she will enjoyed playing with it. somehow, it reminded me of barbie doll products. maybe, its too pinkish for me. the accessories is the "plus factor" in any belville sets. it offered quite a handful of great accessories to add into any types of mocs construction to add in the plus factor in it. sinner, you are a very nice dad! i like how parents, buy educational toys for their children to expand their imaginations instead of sitting in a couch playing video games and etc.

1 aw, sinners' playing with toys again! great review! the set is good for parts it appears. and that bedroom scene is...interesting.

1 thanks for your report and the pics, my sister wants this set, but she's already got the last house and she doesn't play very often with it, but the new one looks very good, too

1 sinner, on jul 25 2008, 09:47 pm, said: i'm still undecided on if it was a smart buy. she played with it a lot this week, but last week she ignored it... and i had to fix it twice! my daughter is 12, and she still plays with all her belville stuff (mostly the fairy princess castle sets). if your daughter is anything like mine, you will definitely get your money's worth out of it. however ... as soon as my daughter says she's done with it, i plan on raiding the sets for all those great food and accessory bits. patience .... great review, by the way. the belville sets are indeed overpriced, but they're probably lego's best attempt at wooing the girl audience (i still hate the fact that tlc thinks they need separate "boy" themes and "girl" themes, but whatever). they're a very nice alternative to barbie -- you get posable figures with realistic body proportions, plus some creativity and building aspects thrown in.

0 i recognize the clock! it came with my old airport set 6392 back in 85! in fact according to peeron it mostly came out in train stations link belville looks horrible to me too barbie-ish and does not look lego at all. would prefer they went with paradisa instead.

1 7655: clone battle pack year: 2007 number of pieces: 58 number of minifigs: 4 price: 9.99 usd brickset welcome to my third review on eurobricks, i hope you enjoy! while at any store that sells lego (target, wal-mart, tru, etc.), you will notice that the clone battle packs on the shelf are way fewer in number than the droids battle pack. as you might guess, the clones are way more popular, and finding them gets harder and harder as the release date of this set goes farther into the past. so stock up! alright, heres a pic of the box: a small box, as expected for inexpensive sets like these. note the "build your army" button on the front: tlg obviously is encouraging customers to buy multiples, and with good reason, which will be explained later in this review. well, lets get straight to it: the contents of this set. you will notice a speeder bike, a gun turret, and some clones. looking good so far! lets have a look at the turret: an excellent star wars element to have around, especially for mocing. it is very cleverly built, using a tire guard from city sets for the general shape of the turret mount. all you have to do is attach the (new mold! explained later) gun to the 2x1 plate with the center stud, and... presto! i wonder how the clones build these turrets to fast in the middle of battle... a rear view: with a clone mounted: my only gripe about the turret is that you have to take off the gun in order for every clone to have a gun. now, we move on to the vehicle of the set, the speeder bike: a rather sleek and good looking bike, with some useful pieces on it as well, such as the blue cones, the megaphones, and the engines. some say it looks bare without the figs mounted on it, but i think it looks just fine. the commander drives while a trooper shoots on the back. a side view: and a rear view: my only gripe is the same as the turret: you have to remove the back gun for all the clones to have weapons while on foot. the back pistol attaches to a 2x2 round studded plate with a technic hole in the middle. finnaly, here are the new guns: this set comes with 1 new blaster rifle and three new pistols. it could have included one more rifle for the turret. and of course, the figs: includes: 1 yellow commander (lovely fig), 1 shocktrooper (comes with a pair of elctrobinouculars), and two regular troopers (so clean and white). the figs are excellent, all that any sw or lego fan should want. it could have maybe included one more regular trooper, but that might be pushing it. thats all for now, folks, here is the... final verdict: build: 8/10, extremely easy, should take the seasoned builder about 5 minutes to complete. a fun build, though. playability: 5/10, i guess you can get this with the droid battle pack and make them battle, but this set has no real play features of its own. but it is good for collecting troops and using them for mocs. swooshability: 9/10, i guess you can zoom the speeder bike around... minifigs: 10/10, four great figs that should be bought in multiples, a great army builder. design: 10/10, a clever turret, an awesome speeder, and four great clones. what more do you need in a 10 dollar set? price: 8/10, not bad i suppose, but if you calculate a dime for each piece, this set should come out to 5-6 dollars. but still, billions of these are being sold world-wide, and tlg is making a ton of money off of them. overall score: 9.5/10, a truly memorable set, one that will be a favorite for ages to come, and very popular. a great army builder for a small price, plus vehicle and turret! with only a few very minor flaws, this set is one of the best of star wars. and this concludes my review, and as always, comments are most welcome.

1 i got like 5 of theses hope we get the new clone battlepack, do you ever think we will? we will only get 5 clones if you buy all the new republic sets...

1 nice review jimbutcher , this set is for many reasons awesome but unfortunately i just buy one. now i am planning on buying one more in my wal-mart there are like three in stock but with a high price of $19.99 each so maybe just one and will keep it misb .

0 i believe there's another set that has star corps trooper with an orange pauldron. is it any better?

0 thanks for the review... ...unfortunately the droid battle pack is discontinued for the uk s@h ...also the clone battle pack is discontinued for the usa s@h ( for the americans)

0 thanks for the great review. nice and sharp pics, just the way i like them. keep it up a nice little battle pack, if one is in to those pesky battle droids kimt

1 hello all eurobricks members and town lovers, this is my first classic town review. for today, i will be featuring the 6641, 4-wheelin' truck which is produced in 1987. for some younger members in eb, you might not have encounter such a baby roaming down the streets, horning at others with its big massive truck. considering this is a 1987 set, such a vehicle size is considered big in those days. name: 4-wheelin' truck theme: lego system / town year: 1987 pieces: 80 minifigs: 1 price: usd$6.50 an image of a 6641, 4-wheelin' truck *hello everyone* why the name 4-wheelin' truck? it is because this truck is equipped with 4 heavy duty wheels which is considered "big" among other small vehicles in classic town. please take note, most of the vehicles that are produced in classic town era, are 4-studs wide. this truck is no exception. meet the driver and his truck! this truck has a very good combinations of different colors that are common for most town vehicles. it made used of blue, white and red as its primary combinations. i find that this combinations is quite soothing to its eyes especially the blue bricks. in addition, the mini-fig torso is superb. the driver must be a great fan of this vehicle. i realised most truck drivers in the classic town era wear this most of the time. i wonder if its some kind of an organization? front view there is 2 red doors coupled with the truck, to enable the driver to get in properly. this vehicle is considered big in the 1980s. however, if you compared it with the current city vehicles, this truck certainly will not outsize the current designs. please take note of the wheels. the wheels are pretty different. i don't remember seeing these wheels in many other vehicles, maybe some members can help me on this. most of the classic town vehicles have a window frame on top which is known as a "sun-roof". in this set, this feature is also included. furthermore, the vehicle frame has a simple mechanism which all town lovers love. it is to lift it up and place their driver in and out the seat. most importantly, you do not have to take off the entire window frame just to put in the driver. different angles of the 4-wheelin' truck snot technique? back 20 years ago, lego had been experimenting with snot technique. you can see that the back looks very neat without the studs. in addition, it can be quite useful to place a mini-fig on top of it, or throw some baggage for some quick getaway. summary review playability: 8/10 (great addition to your town collection.) design: 8.5/10 (very good design. i love 4-studs truck. at least, it is able to occupy one side of the lane) price: 9/10 (an inexpensive set based on the 1987 pricing) overall: 8.5/10 (a must have for all classic town lovers, we have been complaining for more wider range of vehicle) i gave it a "4" based on my review score card. what about yours? hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. pictures can be found in my brickshelf (when moderated) edited by whitefang, 13 july 2008 - 12:08 pm.

-1 great review! but for the car: i don't like the color combination of red+blue

1 great review of a lovely set! thank you! sadly i don't see my 6641 really often, because it is kind of in the back of my shelf. but i might get it and swoosh it (?) a few times...! imho i think 6675 is a little bit more aggressive. cool! please make more!

1 love this set! nice review also.. i had the set in my hands a few times but never bought it, though i drooled at it, i remember. i guess i didn't get pocket money at that time, it was not that common around europe in the 80s i guess. so better to say that no one bought it for me.. a few years later i got the safari truck, which is also really sweet. i like the colors of this model and the detail of it. the minifig is really classic, made only for this set (appears in some later train sets as well) and shows the exact image of the truck on the shirt, including the motor piece. one of the most detailed and loveliest little sets from a sweet era of legoland city! ps voted "o" for outstanding. edited by zzz, 14 july 2008 - 09:50 am.

1 wow! oh set 4999, how do i love thee, let me count the ways: 1)an attractive cottage 2)a usefull service van 3)great parts including green burps! 4)responsible energy for my lego town! this would be the perfect addition to my seaside village. by the way, what is vestas?

1 omg, i have seen the light! will it be availeble from s@h? or is it just a promo? thanks for making my day wonderfull! dr. brick

1 i want it...i want at least five!! where will it be availible?

1 oh my..that looks a-ma-zing! seems my prayers for more civilian sets have been heard! hopefully we will get more such stuff in the city future1

0 awww i wanna see it please? edit: omg its all over the interwebs, if you know where it looks amzaing its a giant windmill with a house at bottom edited by pencoin, 14 july 2008 - 05:24 pm.

1 i had saw the earlier image just now. it looks very nice. just to share some information with you guys. vestas, an global company which is an expert in "wind energy" this is a tie-up with lego. i feel its an illustration on how our world will benefit by applying and believing its technology to make use of re-useable natural resources. hinckley, is it ok for me to share a picture or two on the vestas exhibition that happened few months ago in singapore? don't worry, it's not anything related "directly" to the vestas promo, wind power plant.

1 it would appear that lego wants this beauty kept a secret...=p anywho, this is amazing. i found pics...somewhere...and...oh wow. this thing is a must-have, and i'll be saddened so much if i can't find it anywhere. i doubt they'd keep a set like this promo, though. those parts are great for town fans, castle fans, space fans...you name it, that set could be useful for it. ohhh goodness... ~trexxen, who is blown away by this amazing set...

1 omg! omg! wow! that's simply amazing. wow! i can't say more... wait, i can. this is such a beatiful set. i sure hope it will be available for us to, like european people. it's so nice. it looks like the real thing, great cottage, great pieces, great van and figures. and the windthing. wow!

1 wow! i searched on brickshelf and saw pictures that is just amazing! i can only imagine the cost though. will it be on s@h? or will it be sold elsewhere? cant wait! -darthperson edit: heh, see those cool little chairs on the patio made of the city mudguards? edited by darthperson, 14 july 2008 - 05:58 pm.

0 bagh i missed it all i know is that theres a cottage and van! time for brickshelf no doubt they've been taken down to. edit: awsome just found the brcikshelf pics. edited by skipper 24, 14 july 2008 - 06:05 pm.

0 sounds cool but i can't seem to find any of these leaked pics, not even on brickshelf. maybe i am not searching under the right phrases. oh well. i guess i can wait patiently.

0 what's so great about the cottage? i do agree that the generator and van are teh pwnzorz. edit by hinckley: we prefer the use of real words here. please familiarize yourself with the member guidelines. thank you.

1 filefolders, on jul 14 2008, 07:29 pm, said: what's so great about the cottage? i do agree that the generator and van are teh pwnzorz. i think the great thing about the cottage is its very reminiscent of classic holiday home type houses that lego used to make like this one from the late 80s which a lot of people (me included) believe lego need to make more of.

0 i now found pics, too. that's absolutely ! after 10188 town plan this is the best city set ever! i really like the neat landscape with the little hill (there are a bench and some flowers on it, too ) and this brilliant cottage ! great idea with that power function that the wind mill turns and then enable the lights of the cottage ! concerning the city theme i must say: in the last time tlg comes up with one great surprise after the other. does anyone know where and when it'll be available (this year i think - otherwise there wouldn't be already pics, would they?) and how much it'll cost (i think about 70 euros, what do you think?)? i only hope that it'll be available in germany, too, otherwise i would be really if i am not able to get it since it is a must for every city and environment fan! klaus-dieter edited by klaus-dieter, 14 july 2008 - 06:49 pm.

1 you just bring memory's back i never had one of the space port sets, but i know that as a little boy i visited my toy store and kept on looking to the boxes. on bl those sets cost too much for what ist worth today. really, tlc should bring this theme back! space port on!

0 in the catalog images i thougt that the base was on a 16'16 baseplate... i have some sets of space-port and like them, but i would want real town sets in 1999... edited by lord santos, 15 july 2008 - 10:58 am.

1 i got this set for christmas, and you gave me the feeling for wanting to build it again. thanks for the review!

1 my sister got this from our grandparents once when she was interested with space but it fell into my hands later. i had a lot of fun with that. by the way, the name for the test thing is called a centrifuge. it tests a person's ability to withstand high g-forces. edited by filefolders, 15 july 2008 - 03:55 pm.

1 *mini-bump* wow, i'd completely forgotten about this theme, which is suprising since i absolutely loved this theme as a kid (minus the sound n' light brick, which i thought was pretty big and ugly). sure brings back memories of looking at those little catalogue booklets that came with the sets.

0 i had never seen this set or this theme before. it was released during my dark age, and i had missed it. it's nice to see such sets, surface once again, to educate members like me that there are some good sets we had missed during the dark age. and, i must admit that this is a very good set. it's comes with 3 mini-figs and staudie with it. geez, i never thought he was an astronaunt back then. the testing facility is great, and i love to see it spin, by putting staudie in it for a "test-run". the buggy is cute as well, but somehow, i don't really like the white frame at the back. it looked a little odd to me. the tools, are simply wonderful to have. furthermore, these are grey tools. the last time, we had so many tools are the aeroplane mechanic. the shuttle is nice, but does the shuttle supposed to come with a cover as well? i guess, since this is a simulator, they must have cut down the budget for it. the control room is good, and it will be even better with chairs included. metalandi, thanks for the wonderful review!

0 thank you very much for the review. now i remember! i got mission control when i was only 5 and built it with the help of my older sister. i loved it so much, i never rebuilt it but now... i just have to! space simulation was one i never got but looks to be a great set.

0 wow!!!! i'm just surprised...i thought these were all street dated for the 26th of july. at least that's what i read according to lucas information. oh well, gratz on getin one of the new sets. i'm looking forward to seeing the droid gunship and the twilight real, real, real soon!

-1 well tlc blew this one i was hoping the magna guards would be what they looked like in lsw 1 !!!!! ohwell one more set i dont have to get.

-1 update: i will be merging reviews as they go idle, this is now the dino attack review thread "what, jay's not doing viking reviews!?" nope, i think christopher110 took care of those just fine. instead, i have brought you what is most possibly the highest-anticipated set of the year (;) :d) - the t1 typhoon. and i gotta say - dinos apart, it's actually really cool. the dinos let's get the worst over with. yes. those are all the parts in that 'dino'.

1 the copter this is one bigass copter. the photos really don't do the size justice. lower cockpit with cool computer. too bad it's a sticker, although i'll definitely leave this one on. upper cockpit with cool computer. see above. awesome gatling gun. yes, even the technic beams have stickers. i'm actually really fond of that little canister thing. i can see using it elsewhere. yes - that's a sticker. the rope and hook. i forgot to mention it before, this set comes with two accessories besides the machine gun - binocs and one of those little things to slide down the rope. also, the thing that 'extends' the rope turns. the other side, because they're slightly asymmetrical. one of my favorite stickers. the door says 'survival equipment'. it's on both sides. definitely a keeper.

1 the base of the propeller. it wobbles a bit, but doesn't fall off. very sturdy. right side of the rear propeller. and the left (and better) side. the tail. it uses construction similar to the x-wing's nose, but on a larger scale. definitely cool. a very neat part of the copter. the guns are constructed so that... ... they turn without turning the cockpit. the interior is rather blase, though.

1 another of my favorite parts - landing gear. this is the front section. ... and it retracts! unlike most ships with landing gear, this does not retract without effort (coughxwingcough). very sleek. the back landing gear. ... and again, smooth retraction. gotta love it. final score: 8.4/10 parts: 8/10 figs: 10/10 dinos: 2/10 copter: 9/10 value: 7/10 don't buy if: - you can wait for vikings - you don't like any set with stickers - you're not a space fan buy if: - you're a space fan - you don't mind stickers/don't apply them - you're like to create cool figures overall, i think it was worth the price, even at 605 pieces. however, i'd suggest buying vikings even considering this. well, hope this review (unexpected as it was ;-)) helped someone out there. until next time, bloody jay

0 as unexpected as it was, this was very helpful! ;) three questions, though: 1. is the front green rubber missle a traditional launchable missle, or does it have another firing mechanism? 2. concerning the guns on the side, are they fixed in one postition, or does it have any functions? 3. why did you decide to buy this set? (just curious!)

1 i really want those figs.....damm you bloody jay!!!

1 great review jay !!!!! tks a lot ;) i am not that of the big fan of the copter due to its proportions - but i admit its really asome looking, better as i expected :od the best are those mfs !!!!!! they are truly awsome !!!!!!! i wiil but some of the smaller sets just for the figs hehe (too bad that my favorite - your second best - don't come in the smallers sets :'( ). are you going to review the other sets as well ??? that could be cool !!!!!

1 thanks, bloody_jay. another brilliant review. i really like the helicopter. though i hate the stickers (it seem like there are a lot of it), it won't stop me from buying it. too bad that when will the dino line arrive in singapore. . . :'( guess i've have to wait for the meanwhile.

1 that looks like a really great set, although i don't think i'd have anywhere to put it. i don't think i'll ever be able to get the set anyway, since it doesn't come out over here.

0 hmmmm . . . . interesting. it's a shame though, because i really like the guns. any idea when it should come to europe? edit: i've just scene the official dino attack site, which says they're coming to europe in october.

0 does anyone have photos of the ones being released in europe? i'd like to compare the ones here in the u.s. to the ones in europe...

0 no, there aren't any pictures yet.

0 photos are not available, but basically it is: -guns +chains +ropes +crates

1 wow, great review, for a great set. thanks jay. i really like it, although to big for my city. :( i too really like the mfs. because of your review, i am definitely considering it. thanks again, legobmw.

0 i guess we'll have to wait for the photos! officially announced by lego, the dino attack line is going to be made available in europe in october 2005... edit: check out the official dino attack site here!

1 yeah, i picked up another one. i really liked the chopper! let's cut straight to the chase. dinos: first the worst, of course. these things are so horrible, they don't deserve more than one photo. they're rubbery, one piece, and the only things that remotely indicate that they're made by lego are the holes on the bottom of their feet. they're unrealistic to an extreme unmatched by even the previously reviewed dinos, in that they are waaaaaaaay too thin, one is pink, and they're all grinning. fig: one interesting thing to note is that this one has the same torso as the iron-masked dude in the chopper, not his own bare-arms torso. pic for the sake of comparison. now, i don't consider this fig as good as the others because the other heads are useful for vikings and assorted castle-type people, but this has sunglasses. all in all, you'll probably find it useful, but i don't. still, great torso for special ops stuff. hummer: those headlights - while stickers (yes, all prints are again stickers, although there are much less than the chopper) - are great pieces. i can see using them as furnace covers or stove burners. the windshield/hood area. not much to say about this one. driver's side. my question? when this is brought to europe, will the steering wheel switch sides? ;) seriously though, i love that little steering wheel piece more than i love taffy. and i'm a man who enjoys his taffy. left side in its entirety. ... and the right side. view through the right side - no seat here. could've done with another fig to fill the nonexistant seat, as well.

0 sorry for the double post, but i just had another question in mind: how long/high/wide is this "badass" copter? (including rotors). i have heard of as long as 25 inches for the length, but is this true or is it just an exaggeration?

(including rotors). have have heard of as long as 25 inches for the length, but is this true or is it just an exaggeration? 25" long, and the rotors are 10" long each (making it 20" wide). hope that helps!

1 wow, i think this is the first time i'm the first to have a new set (at least here) and review it. got it 2 days ago, thanks to a fast shipping from s@h this time, and i found time now to review it now. enough of the babbling, let's let the facts and pictures speak, which actually turned out pretty well this time. set nr.: 4210 name: coast guard platform number of minifigs: 4 number of pieces: 469 release year: 2008 a few shots of the box first: 2 books of instructions we got here, first one for the helicopter second one for the rest and the platform itself: a general overview of the platform from above: the 4 minifigs, 3 rescue guys and one oil rig worker (?). the pilot seems not very happy that he has to work in the middle of nowhere at sea right beside the entry of the tower we have the diving equipment holder: next, the guy can jump in this little speedboat... ...and another guy brings it down to water with the crane: if somebody is rescued from the air, he arrives here and is brought to the tower with the little moving platform than runs on "rails": down under we got a buoy and several life belts and extinguishers: with the lift somebody who is rescued by the boat can be brought up. i think it would been better if they would have made a mechanism there to bring it up, but it's okay: a few floors higher the sea is being observated and watched: on the ground level we have the medical station/warm-up room: the helicopter as stand-alone: all in all for me this is besides the police station the city set of this year. it's got great features, and looks fantastic and also has many useful pieces. you can't do anything wrong with buying it, 10/10 for me! that's all for now, hope you liked my review. edit: oh damn, i forgot to write "review" in the topic title, can a mod please add this? thanks!

1 i love this set... and i wish i thought of the bridge piece idea! the only part i don't like is the lift... thanks for the great review. metalandi, on jul 18 2008, 06:53 pm, said: edit: oh damn, i forgot to write "review" in the topic title, can a mod please add this? thanks! done!

1 thanks for the awesome review, metalandi! your pics are very clear and you go into detail about all the functions of the set. i agree, this is a great set - one of the best of the cg line for sure, way better than the boat set with the tower on the bionicle baseplate, and cheaper too. i even like the helicopter better than the oversized version. lots of great parts and a really nice build by the looks of it too. i can't wait for this to be released in oz!

0 seeing the pictures in this review certainly reinforce my original thoughts on this set: here's an oil-rig mod waiting to happen...

1 good review ;) i will buy it this year :)

1 excellent review metalandi. it's always great to see early pictures of new sets. this set really reminds me of an oil rig, and could probably be easily modified as one (if one wanted an alternate model). the two components that i like most are the boat crane and the control room, but other sections are pretty slick as well. are those printed pieces in the control room, or stickers? i'm really starting to gain an appreciation for these new coast guard sets. they've come a long way over the years: 575 coast guard station -released 1978. i picked up the control boat & tower (7739) a few weeks ago but haven't opened it yet). in any case, thanks for taking the time to review this set and share it over eb.

1 great set and great parts pack as well! i guess im gonna buy this when its on sale, just for the orange parts. excellent for exo force

1 i it!! i dont think i'm gonna buy it but i loved the review nice oil rig worker; he looks so rough undersigned mowo

1 thanks for the great review. i'm loving this set a lot - it looks well designed, and the helicopter is awesome! plus, i love the new worker figure with the beard. quote i agree, this is a great set - one of the best of the cg line for sure, way better than the boat set with the tower on the bionicle baseplate i wouldn't say that at all - true, this base is bigger, but the other set was well designed as well - plus the included boat is wonderful.

1 i think it looks good on the real set. i thought, the darker glass might be good on the ground level so the rescued guy has it nice and dark in there

0 i agree with both of you. first, i have to add, that a few of the stickers were a bit annoying as it comes to put them on espacially the ones on the helicopter, where you have to put them on round parts. but i didn't really see this at a bad point, i really can live with it. second, it was a very hard decision, believe it or not, on which new set to buy, cause i got a huge 2008 set-wantlist. i guess it'll take some time before i can get most of the other sets i want

0 thanks a lot for the review, brickster! i never had the chance to get some classic town sets, but i wish i couldve! i just wonder why lego cant release sets like this anymore....

0 thanks! i own this set...! it was a good time as tlg released a lot of little buildings. (just look through the 63xx-setnumbers)

1 paramedic unit, does not seem to suit well for this set's name. it should be named as clinic, outpatient treatment, family doctor and etc. from what i understand, parmedic unit, is a stand-alone unit, that is on standby, 24/7, ready for any emergency rescue in lego town. ambulance, with a group of paramedics will be ideal for this kind of situation. i love female doctors, especially with that lovely hairpiece! the cruiser, is a neat 4-studs wide design. just love these small car designs back then. i wonder what can be used at the back of its boot. the clinic is neat. maybe, we can send holodoc for some medical audit, to make sure that this clinic is up to standard. what surprised me the most, is the neat little eye chart. you don't see such details in any regular lego set. the red and white color combination for the building, works well for me. most of the hospital buildings and vehicles, always revolved in red and white. i gave this a "4" thanks you so much, brickster!

0 i just can't believe someone would rate this set a 1. it appears to be a trend among these classic reviews, never with a comment of why.

0 thebrickster, on jul 19 2008, 02:30 am, said: i just can't believe someone would rate this set a 1. it appears to be a trend among these classic reviews, never with a comment of why. maybe a tfol... it is our "destiny" to show them that lego existed before 1997 and was -imho- way better than today. we need more classic reviews. i hope i can continue with technic sets.

0 people giving this "1"? g... i'd give it a "4". i'd give it a "3" but added a point out of nostalgia... i think it's a nice town set from the old days. the only problem i always had is the lack of an ambulance... and we got a female doctor! :-)

1 brickster strikes again with another awesome review! ah, one of the few hospital related kits lego made. wasn't this the first hospital with modern minifigs? (because i seem to remember seeing an even older hospital online that had the armless, faceless figs). regardless, this would be great as a little doctor's office in someone's town layout - although the vehicle is a little silly. and that eye chart sticker has to be the coolest decal ever. quote maybe a tfol... well, it sure isn't me. i personally love older kits, even though i'm only a teen. i like a lot of the newer sets a bit more than some of the classic stuff, but i have always agreed that the 70's and 80's were an extremely high point in lego's time (even though i don't really own any kits from the period) edited by grevious, 19 july 2008 - 05:05 pm.

1 gave it a 4. it's not exactly town plan, but it's above average.

0 whitefang, on jul 18 2008, 09:11 pm, said: paramedic unit, does not seem to suit well for this set's name. it should be named as clinic, outpatient treatment, family doctor and etc. the definition of a paramedic is "...someone who assists physicians in providing medical care..." i think in more modern times a paramedic is generally thought of as a more qualified and experienced ambulance technician but the dictionary definition would seem to fit with the lego model quite well. cheers rog

1 i like this set, like most i view it more as a clinic, it sits nicely in my town plan. these old sets are all very cool

0 wow! old thread. just for the record, so long as it is here. paramedic's are advanced ambulance technicians. unlike standard emt's they are trained for advanced cardiac life support. they can push drugs, defibrillate, place a breathing tube etc. in the 1980's when the set was made, it was quite common for paramedics to respond to calls in "fly cars" or special response units. they would join up with ambulances at the scenes that required their skills. if you ever watched the old american tv show "emergency", johnny gage and squad 51 were one of these response units. they were mostly phased out in the 90's in favor of simply putting the paramedics and als gear in the ambulances.

0 hello all eurobricks members and town lovers, today, i will be doing up a review on hook & haul wrecker. this name is quite wierd to me. i will prefer to call it the regular tow truck. this is one of the service and repair vehicle that are always ready 24/7 on stand-by for any emergency towing in our towns. name: hook & haul wrecker theme: lego system / town year: 1989 pieces: 44 minifigs: 1 price: usd$6.00 an image of a 6660, hook & haul wrecker let the towing begins hook & haul wrecker is the typical 4-studs wide vehicle that takes care of broken vehicles that is left stranded on the roads. this tow truck is pretty useful. as you can see, current city sets hardly have any tow trucks available to tow new cars design. this tow truck is catered for 4-studs vehicles for classic town. can you imagine yourself this truck towing a speed racer car? i think it looks really out of proportion. in addition, the mini-fig which is included in this set has the regular truck print on its torso. i am very sure they must be a fan club for "trucks". otherwise, they should really need a change of clothes. nevertheless, in my honest opnion. i really love this torso very much. somehow, it makes them look tough even though their face looks very friendly. side view this vehicle has a combination of two primary colors which is white and red. this color combination looks very good. you cannot mistook it for an ambulance since they made use of this two colors too, in most emergency vehicles. this is my guess, i supposed the designer will have tow truck concept as a form of emergency and considered red and white as its combinations. this vehicle set-up has the typical sun-screen on the top of the vehicle frame. however, this baby has more unique features installed in it. these are the source of its brutal strength all-terrain vehicle??? this tow truck equipped with the best wheels. in fact, these wheels offer suspension on the roads. even when its travelling uphill, the truck will move accordingly with its tyres. when you act pressure on the top of the vehicle, it will either be shifted leftwards or rightwards. close-up of these unique tyres take a careful look. these wheels have springs installed in it. that is the magic of these vehicle and is defintely suited to run on any rough roads with least problems. if any eb members know which other vehicles has this unique features, please highlight it to me. because, if i remembered correctly. i only remember seeing this pair of tyres in this great set. he is ready for some serious towing. the driver had finished hook up the pizza van on its back. it's pretty simple. you just have to lift the back of the vehicle and placed it onto the hook. presto, the van is ready to go. this vehicle provides so much fun. you can really tow any 4-studs vehicle in your town. and, here we go! to the service station. poor pizza guy. summary review playability: 10/10 (superb fun. you will love to use this truck and tow any vehicles) design: 9.5/10 (excellent design. especially with the use of the suspension tyres) price: 9/10 (an inexpensive set based on the 1989 pricing. this set is made up of less than 100 pieces) overall: 9.5/10 (every town must need a tow truck. if a vehicle breaks down, whom will be ready to tow?) i gave it a "5" based on my review score card. what about yours? hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. comments and critics are strongly welcomed. pictures can be found in my brickshelf(when moderated)

0 cool review! i've always loved these "hard" looking tyres, i never understood why they don't make them anymore. they looked way more off-roadish.

1 this is one of my favorite town vehicles from the old time, and for one specific reason: the truck is on the guys shirt! it didn't matter that the color was wrong, or the hook was missing. i thought it was awesome beyond imagination... for some reason thanks for the review whitefang.

1 4 stars. the suspension wheel holder totally rocks. yeah. though the slope brick 45 2x3 x 1 1/3 double disappoints me a little. btw: the 6350 pizza to go van looks soooo cute! thanks for the review! (and keeeeep them coming...!)

1 i remember building this set back in the day good set, i'll give it a 4.

0 thanks for all of your encouraging comments! i am glad most of you love to view our classic reviews. do stay out for more upcoming exciting classic town reviews! i appericiate greatly by all of your words. there are many outstanding reviews from brickster as well, especially those classic vintage lego sets, that i had never seen before, except browsing it in brickset. therefore, i will encourage eb members, to take some time off to view these truly wonderful classic reviews. trust me, it shall be an eye opening experience for each and everyone of you, whom had never seen classic town, in such an up close personal experience before. lasse d, on jul 19 2008, 12:22 am, said: this is one of my favorite town vehicles from the old time, and for one specific reason: the truck is on the guys shirt! it didn't matter that the color was wrong, or the hook was missing. i thought it was awesome beyond imagination... for some reason the torso is just lovely! i felt the 6641, 4 wheelin truck is almost identical with the torso, except for the front color combination. click onto the picture for an instant review. bernddasbrot, on jul 19 2008, 02:47 am, said: btw: the 6350 pizza to go van looks soooo cute! yes, that cute pizza van appeared for a reason.

1 another great review, whitefang. this is a wonderful 80's vehicle - and i think it might be one of the first - if not the first - that had the spring suspension system. i know of at least one other set that had that: the biggest extreme team set from 1998 had a vehicle with those pieces. quote this tow truck is pretty useful. as you can see, current city sets hardly have any tow trucks available to tow new cars design. this tow truck is catered for 4-studs vehicles for classic town. can you imagine yourself this truck towing a speed racer car? i think it looks really out of proportion. firstly, speed racer cars are out of scale even with city vehicles. also, i have hope that in the next few years we will get more octan sets to go with the wonderful gas station - and i suspect that a 6-wide tow truck will be at the top of the list. it wouldn't be a hard set to make, and i bet it would sell well. edited by grevious, 19 july 2008 - 05:31 pm.

0 oh! never seen that set before! fun and strange that wheel supension system. has it ever been used in any other sets?

0 indeed they have; they've appeared in 15 different sets, in total. they also have an identical width with the wide 2x2 wheels holder which is used on cars today. they are still excellent today, since retrofitting these suspension parts onto today's off-roader trucks won't give them weird proportions or any problems, and it looks perfect. plus they are useful if you're lazy and don't feel like constructing the pin-suspension used in the early 90's for truck-trailers, altough stability probably will suffer.

1 4/5. i've had this set since i was young. never understood why a tow truck needed to be an off-roader; maybe it was used to tow the other off-road vehicles. the suspension made the truck too tall to tow some cars, so i often took the hook out and use the truck as just an great off-road truck like 6672 (which also had the suspension wheels). other tow truck sets better filled their roles better, but that doesn't diminish this set at all. whitefang, on jul 18 2008, 09:19 am, said: i think it looks really out of proportion. no, for 25-odd years this vehicle was perfectly proportioned with all others in the town/city line. it's all these new 6 and 8 and 20 wide vehicles that are ignoring convention and making it look out of proportion. granted speed racer sets are more of their own line, but 6660 is smaller than most of the cars produced in the last few years.

1 superb review of a great set!this is one of my favourite classic sets becouse of all these functions(engine,suspension)and it's great design with less than 100 pieces used( only 52 )!congratulations for the review!i think that it's an outstanding set and surely worth 5 stars

1 cheers for taking the time to put together this review, whitefang. considering the year of release of this set, i love it. would still fit in nicely in any city.

0 three cheers to classic town trucks! it felt nostalgic to see this appearing at the surface after seven years. time really flies and may classic town continue to be close in fellow townies' hearts.

1 cool set i really loved the classic town sets. this set has lots of detail, great reveiw. do you know what is exxon?

0 nice it's like an alternative to the shell petrol company sets we had over here in the uk. (or did you have them to?) edited by skipper 24, 19 july 2008 - 04:21 pm.

-1 i think we only got shell stations in europe in the 80s... never got this one, but it looks like a typical lego gas station ... once again, i just don't know how you were able to keep stickers and prints in such a great condition! i am sooooo jealous! the tires of the cars are a problem though... it was difficult and painful to put them off the wheel and back on later... the black hat... g... i would have looooooved to have that when i was a boy...

1 great review of a classic set. man, this is sure a wondeful kit, even today. the level of detail is astounding for the time, and the whole kit is really cute. you know, i honestly don't get why some people have complained about the city gas station's figure count - the majority of lego gas stations had no more than three figures - including this one and the wonderful gas and wash express (which i actually own!). i also don't get why people complain about the stickers so much - because even older kits often had a lot. personally, i think stickers are okay, because printed pieces can't be used in as many places if the stickers are really specialized.

1 i love this set, it's nice and simple. maybe it's because i build this set by myself by ordering all parts and buildinginstruction. and i made one extra tanktransporter :

1 excellent review, it's nice to see review of old sets that i don't own i hope to see many more. was this released under the esso name int the uk?

1 thanks for the fantastic review of the esso petrol( ) station! i like this set, a nice contrast to the shell ones, it adds a bit of variety to a lego town. the cowboy hat is a nice addition too.

1 brickster you need your own sticky review section, i love looking at all of these old sets, as i have said before you take me back to a much simpler time. thank you and on to the set. i love this gas station lego really needs to look to it's past on some of these sets for the time the level of detail is great. i wish i still had this one in one piece as well.

0 again great topic/poll, thebrickster! i gave this set a 3: which is on the one hand negative is that it's really old-fashioned for today . which is on the other hand positive is that it includes very nice and authentic details (like e. g. doors in the cars ) which is imo for that time a feat . klaus-dieter

1 best mars mission set ever deserves a great review. :d

1 iamded, on jul 20 2008, 12:36 am, said: anyway, i don't normally like it when people make a topic to say they'll review a set soon, but i'll let you off since this is one of the few mars mission sets i really like, and i'm glad to know somebody has the set and will be reviewing it. ~peace this practice annoys me as well - especially since i built this set last night and considered making it my first review until i saw this thread. i don't want to step on any toes, so i'll let the original poster go ahead with the full review. in short, to tide everyone over, this set is fantastic. i really like the alien ship, and the main drilling unit/break away ship is an awesome unit with tons of play value. highly recommended! edited by clubninja, 20 july 2008 - 03:41 pm.

1 wonderful review. i'd die if i had to upload that many pictures... man, this is it: the pinacle of mars mission's second and final year. man, this baby is flawless. there are so many indications that the designers took care in designing this kit - like the space for the pilot's backpack, the compartment for the mini flier, the sturdy leg design - etc etc etc. kudos to tlc for making mars mission go out with a bang. i have high hopes that whereever the space theme goes next year, tlc will make it worth the wait. edited by grevious, 20 july 2008 - 05:43 pm.

1 is it seriously? this set was a must-buy for me in the first place, but now that i see it in so much detail, it's just perfect... even the alien ship is better than usual. i love the scooter that flies out of the escape pod, the backpacks, bulldog stickers, and water tank. :d i'll be getting this one! space fans unite!

1 nice review! i really want this set, but i love most mars mission sets so it shouldn't be a surprise! it's great to see a good driller at last. iamded, on jul 20 2008, 02:36 pm, said: anyway, i don't normally like it when people make a topic to say they'll review a set soon, but i'll let you off since this is one of the few mars mission sets i really like, and i'm glad to know somebody has the set and will be reviewing it. ~peace i feel the same way... we have been considering closing topics like this. in ~vbbn~'s defense, he was fast.

1 excellent review, it's a great set, i really love the look of the little ship. would it be possible to get some walking pictures of the walker?

1 holy brick! i just love the water tank and those legs are soooo cool! i dont think i have enough cash to buy after the star wars release...yikes...! thanks vbbn,for a super review!

1 i don't like mars mission sets but this one is just spectacular! it is beautiful! i must have this set, even if it means selling my kidney! i only have one mars mission set, the etx alien mothership assault, which is okay. but this set blows my mind! two thumbs up!

1 today i'm gonna review the bigger of the 2 castles from the fright knigh theme. i got this one last week at a pretty fair prive at ebay, new and still sealed. i love opening boxes that had been lying arounf for years and being the first to build an old set. since i know this castle theme is not liked so much by the general public, i'll try here and change their minds, cause i really think this is a great set. this time i have to say my pictures turned out pretty amazing, even if i am still using just my cellphone cam, but i'm really pleased now with the quality. here we go! set nr.: 6097 name: night lord's castle number of minifigs: 7 number of pieces: 598 release year: 1997 let's start with a few box & instructions pictures: the inside od the box, with a few alternate models: the back, with another possibility how to assemble the 3 main parts: instructions: next, the 6 minifigs, starting with the witch on her black dragon: all 5 figures of the fright section: and the poor royal knight: we go on with the set itself, first a general overview (it's really high!): on the "first floor" there's a trap with which you can drop stones or other things down on unliked guests, the pot comes originally from fabuland i think, i love this thing: in the same floor there is a second trap, if you pull the bar, the door opens: we move on to the tower itself (did i mention it's really high?), on the ground level there's the place for the witch to do her spells: the wall is a secret door, which reveals a skeleton when turned over: on the next level there is this little thingy, first it only seems like a barrel.... ...but when you pull the two 1x4 tiles on the back, a skull is being revealed, scary, huh : i don't really understand what this is for but i assume it's a telescope to watch and observate the dragons, i do find that a bit senseless since there haven't been telescopes in medieval times (or have there been): the back of the tower with the prison and the room for the treasure chest: the prison opened. it's secured with a chain, which i like very much cause you really can lock it with that: treasure chest: from the highest peak we now go down to the very ground level, at the back of the castle there is another secret wall-door, flanked by two shields: at the back half of the inside there is the throne hall for the bat lord, with a nice warm fireplace in the back (this is, where the secret door is placed): the second half is pretty empty, except for these two baskets. i don't know exactly what they are for, but i ike the idea for using them as water places for the horses: one thing that might be a bit stupid is that 2 of the 4 side entrances do not have doors, so they are open and a guard would have to stand there the whole day. you can see it in his face he isn't very happy with that : that was my last review of the sets i got the last weeks, but i'm looking forward to make much more in the future. overall this is a pretty good set, i don't know any other one with so much details and playability. the minus point is, as already said, that it is too open on the sides, but that can be solved easily with a bit of modding. also i must say, this set isn't that much juniorized as many might have thought, though the design is a bit unconventional, but exactly that's what i like most about it. all in all it gets a 9/10 for me hope you enjoyed the reading and the pictures, can't wait to see your response. edit: oops, i forgot to put one figure of the fright knight faction on the photo, but it's the one in the last picture. edited by kimt, 10 august 2008 - 01:28 pm.

-1 sweet review, metalandi! this set always looked a bit too busy for my liking, i guess i just didn't expect to see a set so tall. after seeing your review though, it is growing on me. i like all the play features, and at the very least it's a great parts pack. two things i'm confused about though. in this pic, is that dragon being used as a swing set? and i don't get why the area where the witch casts her spells on the second floor is green. green in castle means grass (or forestmen... ), and having grass on the second floor of a building is just weird. i understand that it's modular and thus it would make sense if it were placed on the ground, but dark grey would make just as much sense, and would look much better than the green there imo. anyway, i'm just fussy. thanks again for the cool review, will we be seeing any more? ~peace

0 i love the reviews of older sets that i never had. also, tiny thing, but you said it has 7 minifigs, but the group shots only include 6. the last guy isn't shown until the very end.

-1 @iamded: yes it seems the dragon is used as such in the picture of the alternate model, but i guess bad and evil knights also wanna have some fun sometimes you are right with the green plate on the second floor, it does look a bit disturbing. but that can

1 i thoroughly enjoyed your review metalandi, thank you especially for taking photos of all the contraptions and detailing exactly how they work. as a member of classic-castle, the census always seemed to be that fright knights were a class 4/10 or 6/10 but as sandy stated above, it is one of the closest you can get to an evil faction. by today's standards, the contraptions seen here are much much more sophisticated and well thought out and are definitely missing in 2007's king's castle siege. i enjoy the design of this castle much more even if the towers are taller simply because the design in the king's castle siege left builders with an empty space right in the courtyard without even a base plate! and it's nearly impossible to get your hands in and play in the enclosed space (why would anyone unless you're simply posing figs, and even that was difficult). this castle instead, had a variety of trap doors and surprises, so despite the varied colors used here, it's not that hard to realize that the designers for this castle really took time to think things out and tried to make the castle enjoyable for the children that will play with it whereas our 2007 castle was strictly built to give kids the impression of an enormous magnificant castle with little to nothing inside. it's like comparing beauty (2007) to brains (this castle). edited by legobear, 20 july 2008 - 01:32 am.

1 very nice of a very nice set. the revolving fireplace - i wonder what movie that could possibly be from?

1 ah this brings back memories, i have this set and i loved the playabilaty factor opposing to older castle sets i have! in medieval times there actually were primitive telescopes, you can read about it here. thanks for this review, great storie, great pics!

1 wow, what a cool castle and set in general! i had no idea that this set existed (long dark ages) thanks to you metalandi for such a great review! the figures look really nice and the set is full of lots of little trinkets , details, traps etc! i have already had a look on ebay for this set. looks like a great set for parts too. i give the review 4.5/5 evil witches. cheers isc

1 my first post in this topic looks foolish now that i bought this set from ebay. i just really wanted the minifigs (although i already had the batlord and the black dragon) and the parts. they will help me greatly in building the impenetrable fortress of the dragonwarriors for my princess quest comic. by the end of this week, this set will be in my clutches!

0 well, that the bricks look new comes from that they are new. i got this set new and unopened

1 metalandi, on aug 6 2008, 01:40 pm, said: well, that the bricks look new comes from that they are new. i got this set new and unopened i know, pretty good deal!

1 good review - the photo from above shows off the scale of the castle much better than the box photo. i was one of those who always thought this set looked lame, ever since first seeing it in the catalogue. a couple of my siblings had smaller bat lord/fright knight sets and enjoyed the accessories and style of the minifigs etc. so last year having not only ended my dark ages, but done so for some of the rest of my family, i got this set off ebay for my sister for christmas. i of course had to build it to make sure all parts were there before leaving ebay feedback and ending the transaction. first impressions were of how much brick there was to the set, as well as really useful large structural elements. and to be honest, while perhaps a bit childish, there's no doubt the style of the minifigs is kinda cute and useful for customs. it was really enjoyable building this set, and the scale is impressive when built, empty spaces notwithstanding (but hey, lego has always had buildings with no back, etc. - just use your imagination and enjoy the access to playspace offered). the traps etc. are neat and more like the kind of "action features" modern sets come with (i for one am in favour of these, for kids they are fun and i think for builders they give ideas cause they are often done with minimal parts or impact on the set design). anyways, needless to say my sister loved the set. indeed she's currently rebuilding it for the second time. if i see it as cheap again, i will pick up one for myself. i got the first one at 30 incl postage i believe.

1 quite the topic bump, but dang, what a cool set, and so tall. this is the kind of sets i had as a kid, but i don't remember this one. i'm jealous.s

-1 i got a couple of the small sets from this line when it came out. recently, i acquired several more from bricklink because i just really love the way they look. this theme really had good intentions, but the execution was flawed. i hope one day lego returns to a darker tone, but maybe next time it could be more castlevania inspired. that would really turn some heads! plus, vampires and gothic aesthetics are really popular now. it will probably have run its course by the time lego would be able to develop a theme around them, though.

1 this is a great set and a great review - thanks for doing these! i remember my brother getting this set (i got the police station 6384 on the same day). truly classic sets - it's a shame that i don't have them anymore although i do have the two immediate descendants of the sets... cheers rog

1 great review again it's nice to see old sets reviewed. i love the control stickers there's a great level of detail this is really the second best fire station in my opinion.

1 lovely!! i can't stop making comparisons between this fire station and last year's, which is also very well detailed, with great features and awesome playability. the concept design of the second one it's very much like the one reviewed here. this is good as tlg is taking back those great values to make the new excellent sets we all are enjoying by now!

1 a 5/5. the set is beautiful, both the remake and the original. a classic and a beautiful thing, like dos. edited by maiq the liar, 20 july 2008 - 09:45 pm.

1 i have a slightly different version of this set, and i must say it is great! boy to these reviews bring back memories, thanks!

1 i am a proud owner of this set this is one of the best fire stations ever. what amazes me is what the designers made with only 368 pieces. you get a very nice looking building in good size, a good baseplate, 2 cars, 4 minifigs, accessories... and great alternative ideas in the back of the box (like the fire boat or helicopter). this is a great example of lego design.

1 i must agree great fire station, i love the fact that in the classic sets you were given a base plate and some other great idea's. i do miss the addition of base plates and alternate building idea's. the only newer set i have seen with any alternate build photo's is the 7239 fire engine. i miss back when.......

1 fire copter 1 this is fc-1, over. i'm making my way to main street now. the smoke is coming from the legoland hotel, over. that's a roger. i'm going to shoot the 500 gallon now, over... fire in your tabletown? no problem. lego's set 6685 fire copter is sure to put it out - classic style. set #: 6685 year released: 1982 piece count: 99 minifigs: 1 list price: unknown here's a great fire-themed addition to your classic legoland display. starting with the instructions: the set includes one classic fireman with a nicely printed fireman torso: what a great little detailed helicopter. i love the use of the red and yellow colors: the front opens to allow your fireman to quickly climb in: in the back are two round yellow 2x2 bricks for the water supply and a hose connected on each side. unfortunately, i lost one of the hoses. and the entire set. isn't she a beauty? 6685 fire copter 1 is a great supplement to set 6382 fire station released one year earlier. after buying this great little set, i had fun puting out fires all over my tabletown. oops, i think i smell one now...

0 thebrickster, thank you so much for all these reviews of classic town sets!! omfg, this set was released in 1982 and i was born 1 year earlier, hehe :) nice little heli!

1 a great small set! i remember this set most of all because of the inverted window screen. loooooved the chopper, but never got it... another "5" please

1 good, but i like the heli of set 6571 better: another "4" from me.

0 well its ok but its not great voted 3 seems the classic town hater has voted a 1 again!!!! will the madness ever stop!?!

1 i owned this set, and i loved it. great idea to have the reversed windshield.

1 hello all eurobricks members and town lovers, today, i will be doing up a review on snorkel squad, one of the most important and basic vehicle in any fire department. snorkel squad, in simple english terms, it refers to fire engine, fighting fire, always on standby, ready to save the citizens from crisis. trust me, you will understand why this snorkel squad is superb impressive by the end of this review. on a side note, there is only part that is replaced by another color. can you find the difference? name: snorkel squad theme: lego system / town year: 1987 pieces: 151 minifigs: 2 price: usd$13.50 an image of a 6358, snorkel squad looking smart on their stand-by this snorkel squad is a fanastic fire engine, that is ready to save people from the fires. it's primary color "red" is used in all fire emergency department and vehicles. in case of any emergency, this snorkel squad will be activated and arrived at the scene as soon as possible. no time to waste! personally, this is the best fire engine that i had ever seen. meet the fire fighters it comes with two brave fire fighters. both of them wear the standard fire fighter outfit that is present in almost all fire station sets in classic town. the torso is very nice and formal, and looks real impressive onto them. i love the buttons on them. furthermore, these white helmets are a symbol to the world of fire fighting. these are the people whom save lives by risking their own lives in dangerous situations. water hose compartment the water hose is a string that is stored in the front. it can be rolled out, and the fire fighters are able to use it without much difficulty. they will just pull out the hose and spray onto the fire. the next picture, shows a much clearer look in its interior. in addition, the fire logo that is on the compartment, is actually printed. yes, it's not a sticker, and that is great news for us! interesting features these clamps on both sides, is supposed to stablise the fire engine when the ladder is heading upwards. it is a simple mechanism, which illustrate clearly what it does. this feature is recently seen in construction vehicle such as the mobile crane. of course, it is not a complicated feature. it just made use of three quite common white parts. swivel mechanism these swivel mechanism, in my opnion are very fun to play with. these connectors on the front and the back, enable the long fire engine, to make sharp turns on any junctions, arriving at the scene fast enough. this is not a fire engine that only travel straight roads. try it onto your base plates, and you will be surprised, how well it can turn. best playable mechanism in 6358 the driver will be activating the ladder at the back of the vehicle. in order, to adjust the height and making sure that the ladder do not fall short, the tiles on the plates are acting like a stoppage. the ladder are able to rotate 360 degree without much problem, if you removed the driver out of the control panel. it goes up as tall as 30cm! look at that amazing height. too bad, i have not constructed my cafe corner yet. otherwise, i can give you a better feel of how amazing this baby can go. i used the old road baseplate as a guide, and roughly it can goes as tall as 30 to 35cm. look at the black hinges below. by shifting it to the last, that was the maximum height it can move. this is a very good way to adjust the height. oh, and i forget to mention that there are 2 storage compartments for the fighters to place their equipments behind. quite easy to access. no doors? apart from the standard roof top on the driver's seat, there is no doors present at both side. i am quite sad to see that there are no doors. maybe, these fighters are supposed to jump off the seat, instead of opening the doors? well, i guess this is the only major flaws that i had found in this set. heading off *got you* meet the model 6358 fire engine summary review playability: 10/10 (superb fun. the ladder and swivel mechanism is really very fun to play with.) design: 9.5/10 (excellent design. it got an almost full 10. the lack of doors, dropped my ratings slightly.) price: 8/10 (a very mid range price. i don't think it cost very expensive. but, i am not sure how much it cost now.) overall: 9.2/10 (best fire engine ever, and one of the great looking one too. get this model now.) i gave it a "5" based on my review score card. what about yours? hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. comments and critics are strongly welcomed. pictures can be found in my brickshelf (when moderated)

0 thanks for another great review. i can remember the 6358 very vividly. my parents bought the 6340 for me and a girl friend got the 6358. i'm quiet sure it's my envy because until now i want to believe that the 6340 is better. my reasons were these: i own the 6340 (and on the instructions of the 6358 stood "legoland" which i thought of as old.) but this review induced me to get over this humiliation from my childhood ( ) and check ebay for the 6358. edited by bernddasbrot, 21 july 2008 - 04:07 pm.

1 a truly great set. i always loved the mobile crane and was gobsmacked when this popped up using some of the great features from the crane but also making it an emergency vehicle too! great classic firemen and - in your version - a suspiciously blue fire extinguisher great review of a great set - just a pity i no longer have it... so many sets i used to have got lost during the period at the end of my childhood before i rescued what was left from my dad's house once i realised what i had left behind!! hindsight is a great thing?? cheers again rog

0 a great review, i like this set it captures the classic town feeling well, and the ladder is cool! i can't help but feel thought that these reviews are being churned out to quickly, you should leave a gap, i am being flooded with all these great reviews!

1 this definitly is a nice set, i think this was also the first set to use that white basket nice one whitefang!

1 what an awesome little set! i really like this engine but don't remember seeing it during the late 80s. it must have been out during my dark ages. i love the basket/section for the firemen. equally nice is the fire hose which extends a good length. the color combination of red with white and the trans. blue windshield looks goos as well. this is a great engine and one that would look perfect in a classic tabletown - and it's 4-studs wide! very nice review whitefang. i look forward to seeing more of your classic town reviews.

0 nice reveiw it looks like a great set i think i know what i will do tonight- rebuild my lego fire department it has- [fire pickup truck, fire truck [from 2005 sorry cant remember set number] and the most recent fire station if i can find all the pieces......

0 nice review, whitefang, with lots of photos - exactly as a good review should be! as for the set - i own it and it's a very good one! the fire squad vehicle is a nice addition to my other fire dept. vehicles. it offers very good playability and this ladder is so long! you can have so much fun with it.

1 that's a great review/poll, whitefang! i gave this set a 5: it's simply ! the only thing which i miss are the respirators for the firemen since they already own air tanks. but otherwise this set is brilliant! i like it much more than the new one from 2007 since it's not that big and juniorized. klaus-dieter

1 great set. i found only one major fail - this - the hands of robot arms gets easly broken.

1 thanks for the review. this set was outstanding for its time with all the features and detail. the extending basket is just wonderful. however, i honestly wouldn't consider it the best firetruck ever. i actually like the one from 2005 even better - becasue like most of the city vehicles, it adds the needed bulk big engines like fire trucks need. many of the older kits, while awesome, were honestly a little too skinny imo.

1 guys, thanks for all your great comments! nikola bathory, on jul 22 2008, 06:57 pm, said: it offers very good playability and this ladder is so long! you can have so much fun with it. yes, the "extended length" of the ladder provides great playability! klaus-dieter, on jul 25 2008, 03:01 am, said: i like it much more than the new one from 2007 since it's not that big and juniorized. thanks k.d. i owned the 2007 fire engine as well, as this set was not restored back then, and i needed a fire engine very badly. i managed to restored it somehow, and i compared it with the 2007. the older design is still the best. osakana, on jul 25 2008, 04:03 am, said: great set. i found only one major fail - this - the hands of robot arms gets easly broken. yes, this is an interesting finding. i remembered when i was a child. that robot arms always come out of its own, when i fiddle with it. i was so annoyed by it and i just kept it there whenever i deployed it for rescue missions. grevious, on jul 26 2008, 02:00 am, said: however, i honestly wouldn't consider it the best firetruck ever. i actually like the one from 2005 even better - becasue like most of the city vehicles, it adds the needed bulk big engines like fire trucks need. many of the older kits, while awesome, were honestly a little too skinny imo. grevious, i appericate your honest comments, and given me your insight towards this set, and state a comparison as well. i agreed with you, that fire engines need to be big and sturdy. on the other hand, it can be nice to have the fire engine to look slim as well, to cut through the traffic easily. i am not against with the newer sets. it just that, part of the reasons which reflected in the review had fufill the basic key factors of a typical fire engine. in addition, it was my all-time favourite under the "fire-fighting" theme.

1 one of my all time favourite i still love it even after all these years, though it did always seem a bit out of place as when i was a child id never seen a similar looking fire appliance in the uk.

0 nice pictures, but three questions: 1. how many pages do the instruction books have? 2. what are the spare parts? or: does this laaty come with two clone-commander-equipment sets and four assaij ventress lightsaberhilts? 3. where did you get it? 4. how much did it cost?

1 it looks like a really good set and like it is a lot larger than the old one. thanks for the review!

0 i have a question, what is the door above the gun for? (pic)

1 so basically, you cited as faults what everybody had been complaining about since the first information of the set arrived? skeletal interior and lack of clones? although i didn't realize it didn't have numbered backs. that really is just ridiculous. lego finally comes up with a very intelligent solution to the frustration seen when building large sets, but then they neglect to implement it. wtf? lame. still, this may be the only clone wars set i buy besides the exclusives. the exterior, which imo is the only part that matters, looks so fantastic. i don't care about clones, i have enough of those already. and at 90$ it's still a better buy than the rgs. the torrent is cool but not as cool as the fighter tank or dgs imo. awesome in-construction pics.

0 thanks for the reivew. could you post a few pics of the at-te in all it's glory? kimt

1 just picked this set up, and just took a break from building to go to football practice. i have just finished building all of the legs, and so far it looks like it is going to be a great set. i would have like it if more clones were included, but whatever. i find it interesting how many clone accessories they give you. i don't like it only because i can't decide what i want to use. i find it interesting that at lease 2 people are missing pieces. i have had multiple times where i thought i was missing pieces, only to find that they were in the bag somewhere. other than the fact that there is a lack of minifigures, i love this set and can't wait to finish it later tonight. edited by swman, 04 august 2008 - 08:33 pm.

1 i bought this a few weeks ago and absolutely loved making it. it's amazing how the paneling comes together to make such a tight fit, but can easily open up. the legs could have been a bit more poseable, and the guns don't launch easily unless you push hard and fast. i'd like the firing mechanism to launch more smoothly. but it looks absolutely amazing. about price, it was 13,000 where i am, but i'm used to lego being expensive in japan, so it was good value.

1 funny minifig actions there. i do love the at-te, a definite buy for walker fans.

0 thank you that was what i guessed :) but i didn't see any detailed pictures of 10195, do we have the instructins or something now? is that how dropship lifts the walker ?

0 i dont think we have instuctions yet... but on topic, i have an at-te in the mail, on the way, so i should have a review of it in the next week or so. jifel

0 cagri, on mar 10 2009, 06:10 pm, said: sorry for reanimating this topic. there is a technic brick in the mid section of this set. does anyone know the function of that ?? yup. this is the one, right?

0 yeah, when i built it, i wondered for a long time. i considered many possiblities temporarily, like either tlc had gone crazy or i had missed a page in the instructions.

1 7676: republic attack gunship number of pieces: 1034 number of minifigs: 5 price: 119.99 usd brickset hey everyone, i just got the rgs yesterday at tru after i came home from camp. i saw all of the topics that i missed, and noticed a mini-review and a review with one pic, so i thought i'd make a huge, shiny new review that has lots of pictures and all of the requirements of kimt's index. note: i did not apply any stickers to it, as a personal liking. so, lets start by looking at the box: a shiny, clean, and futuristic box, quite different from the other star wars box designs before this. there was so much clone wars merchandise with this font and design in the huge display at the front of my local toys r us store, and not just lego. it so beautiful, with the white and sky blue... anyways, for some reason, the boxes of the new clone wars sets seemed more shiny than usual. maybe it's because they were just shipped, but once you pick up the boxes, they will feel really good in your hands, despite the fact that only about half of the space in the boxes are used... the back of the box: the back shows all of the main features of the set, plus pictures of the three other clone wars sets meant to be released alongside this one (although i did spot the twilight and homing spider droid, which were supposed to be released in september or october). so, on to the gunship: built straight from the bags. it took me about 4 1/2 hours, with breaks. it has an overall great design, but somewhat fragile, especially when building it. the cockpits always fall apart when opened, as well as the bubbles on the wings (which i will get into more later). the color scheme is very well done. you can always find the piece you're looking for thanks to the color diversity: red, dark red, lime green (ooh!), blue, black, tan, light bley, dark grey, yellow and white. also, split down the middle vertically, the ship is almost all symmetrical. front: side: now, lets start with the many features that this set is hiding. the front has lots of lime green, a rare color. but more importantly: ...a rotating gun is found on each side. they rotate in a pretty wide range, although fragile. cockpits: there are two main cockpits, right next to each other. not very detailed, and are the same. and for some reason, the whole cockpit element flips up to reveal: ...nothing. just the skeleton of the ship. probe droid storage: above the cockpit lies a plate that can be flipped up to reveal a storage area that holds: two of these probe droids. at least, that's what i think they are. hull: in this pic, two features are hidden. mobile command center: the first of the two is a mobile command center, but essentially just a hover chair. it is found by flipping up the two panels on either side of the hull. bacta tank: the second is the bacta tank found by just sliding it out of the storage area behind the mcc. one half of the tank opens: ...so a minifigure can go inside and heal his/her wounds obtained in battle. cargo hold: now, this is probably the main feature for this set. the two sliding doors (two on each side) slide open thanks to a clever technic mechanism. not much in here, just a gun holder and a place where the passengers wait to be dropped off in battle. speeder bike: i guess you guys saw it, the speeder bike. it is found by opening the rear flap. the bike is very cleverly designed by using a brown trike body. it's only a few centimeters shorter than the bike found in the clone battle pack. rear gun: just a gun similar to the front ones. engines: huge engines (or are they cannons?) that are really fun to build. they really give that cartoon feel to this set. missiles: in between the engines are two sets of four flick-fire missiles. bubble cockpits: there is one bubble cockpit on each wing that supposedly control the turrets at the front. very fragile. storage containers: two storage containers on each side hold the clone accessories. but, i wouldn't recommend putting them in there, because the antennae can fall out, or you might forget about them. sticker sheet: the dreaded sticker sheet (dss) has all of the stickers you need for this set. unfortunately, mine was crunched up. i don't like stickers much anyways, but i might still apply some. note the republic symbol stickers, why couldn't tlg just use that printed piece from a few years back? also, you get to choose between a bird-rat thing or a sleeping twi'elk as your hull decal. what they're for, i don't know, looks like the movie or show will explain it though. minifigs: finally, the five minifigs of this set. they are all great figs, including: commander cody: amazing, especially with the gear. the orange is nice, but i thought he was yellow. clone trooper: again, amazing. the gear is great, and the new helmet and torso are great! all of the clones in the clone wars line have the same heads. also, you can see the flesh beneath the helmet. asaaj ventress: not so happy about this one. the torso and dark blue legs are cool, but the dress is pretty ugly. the head is alright, but could do without the cartoon-y face (yeah i know, its from a cartoon). also has purple markings on back of head. obi-wan kenobi: pretty cool, besides the face. cool hair and torso, though. plo koon: beautiful! the true gem of this set, in my opinion. the head is the same material as kit fisto's. and the tosro is awesome, good for making a custom ki-adi mundi. well, that's about it, here is the... final verdict: build: 8/10, very fun and easy, should take the seasoned builder about 4 hours. somewhat fragile. playability: 9.5/10, lots of fun features, although some can break easily. swooshability: 3/10, i wouldn't recommend flying it around much, as you can barely pick it up safely. but with two hands gripping the bottom firmly, it can be moved around, but not spun or swooshed, etc. minifigs: 8/10, all very great figs, especially plo koon, but could have included more clone troopers. design: 7.5/10, some excellent ideas included in here, although some spots are very fragile. price: 7/10: should have been only 100 usd if not for the new molds. plus, at tru, it was 130 usd. overall score: 8.5/10, a great set to have for your star wars/ clone wars collection, with some flaws. save up for this one. so, how did you like my review? your feedback is much appreciated! jimbutcher, out. edited by jimbutcher, 15 september 2008 - 03:06 am. indexed

0 okay, if this were the first review of the set, i'd understand your want to reserve a thread for your review, but seriously, there are already reviews out there. couldn't you have just waited at least until you had actually built the thing, or even better, until the review was actually done? sorry if i'm being to harsh but i'm quite sick of these "blablabla set review - will be up soon...". it's getting quite annoying. ~peace

0 thank you oky wan, and apologies to the rest of you guys, i guess i was rushing a bit and didn't think this through, it was wrong of me to reserve a review, if someone does an in-depth review before me, someone please close this topic. otherwise, i guess i will do it. again, many apologies for opening this topic before i actually had a review, bad example from me, very sorry!

0 can't wait my friend!

0 hey guys, the full review is up, check it out! i guess its a little late, but, warning: picture heavy.

0 good... but you said that you thought that cody was orange, but he turned out to be orange?

1 very good review, thanks! lots of useful information about this very cool set!

1 i really like the new gunship. different enough from the old one to be better, but similar enough that they don't look totally weird together. really like the new minifigs. didn't think i would like the new clone troopers at all. the accessories are fine. i would never use them on the regular clones, but to each their own.

0 thanks for all the feedback so far, guys! i meant yellow for cody's color.

1 jimbutcher, finally i had seen something that is worth reading and viewing. imho, this is your best star wars review i had ever read. most importantly, it is a complete review which has substance. you have my thanks! keep up the good job back to the rgs, this is the next star wars set i will be getting. i can't wait to lay my hands on this set, and start building. basically, how bad this set can be, it can't be worse. republic gunship is one of the all-time favourites, in star wars prequel and ot. i can't find any faults, except being too expensive due to the licence cost. in addition, the mini-figs are the next big thing. seriously, i am quite impressed with it. on the down side, my rating will go up if there is an additional clone trooper instead of one. nevertheless, this is a "must get" set, no matter what!

0 thanks for the review. i havent seen any other clone flashligh pics, so thanks for that one "starting tonight, people will die... i'm a man of my word." jifel

1 i got this set in the spring during my "buy every new castle set available"-season. granted, i couldn't afford all of them, but i do have most of them now. anyway, i love the action elements to this set, and the siege tower really does look wicked. i'd like to attach the crownie tower to the king's castle to see how it fits, but i unfortunately don't own that set (yet). i also love the turning head of the soldier, and i've used it in my princess quest-comic as well, along with the turning head of the princess. the troll leader brings good variety to the army of trolls, but they still could use another face type and more torso options. it's a nice review, in any case, although the set pretty much speaks for itself.

1 excellent review and your pictures are very good, i look forward to seeing more review. i really like this set i got it some time ago and keep meaning to post some pictures of it going up against some of the older castles.

1 i scream clone, on jul 29 2008, 04:42 pm, said: very nice review pedro! you beat me to it. there was a review done about january, but i wanted to have a go, just haven't opened the box yet..... great pics and well demonstrated action elements too. i rate this as one of the coolest castle sets just for its playability and 5 figures. this will def add to my orc army, and i may purchase more of this set if they dont release a orc bp. keep up the good work! for now, there is the impulse set... great review and excellent photography, i love this set, as it has many good features and the siege tower is the best tlc one yet! thanks again!

0 great review! this is an awesome set. besides knocking down the wall at the side, can the battering ram do any other damage to the tower (ex, reducing it to rubble bricks)? and why can't the orc just jump out of the hole in the back? do they need to do that much unnecessary damage to the tower?

1 thanks for the review! from this set, i prefer the crown knight's tower - it's a very good-looking structure!

1 pedro, for your first review, you have amaze me with your photo session and the strucutre of your review. i am very impressed by your high quality pictures. you have done an excellent job! i love the tower raid very much, as it offers high playability. with the wall and flooring, falling down, when the ram hits the wall, it's quite interesting to play with. the mechanism of the ram is very fun to play with as well. i will try and pull back and released it, to knock a row of soldiers. this is one of my favourite sets in castle 2008. well done.

1 th set was fantastic becuase it was cheap and supplied a very good amount of pecies and had rather good minifigures.

1 i have one of these and must say that this is the best castle set in the theme, and the most useful parts pack for its size yet.

1 nice short review, although a little hard to read. i agree that this set is a really great one.

1 i really liked this set, it's cheap and comes with a good supply of flesh heads and the new hair mold. i love the tent too. i'd give it a 10/10.

1 i give it a 10/10 for the parts. that's the reason i got mine.

1 a great price point for a nice bunch of figs and accesories. pity about the fleshies though... god bless, nathan

1 fleshies sometimes come in handy. great review and good set, but as said by other: another russian soldier (or two) would be fine, tlc is being a bit too much of a cheapskate regarding minifigs lately.

1 good review. this is my second ij kit that i got and i think it is a great deal. only 10$ and get 3 figs and great parts to use. i may pick up 2 more so i have penty of ants and other goodies that this comes with.

1 i picked this up last weekend, mainly also for parts. it came with two mutt heads instead of a irena head. :( but anyway, it's a nice little $10 set...we need more sets like this that include these myriads of "detail" parts.

0 i was tempted to go buy this setbecause i havn't got a indiana jones . but when i went to get it and there was none .i still havn't got a indiana jones

1 time for my first review! 7673 magnaguard starfighter peices: 431 # of figs: 2 price: 44.99 usd the box: pretty decent size box for the price. magnaguards: the normal box stuff: front of the ship: back: open cockpit: back of the box: contents: dss (dreaded sticker sheet): first manual page (because it's super important not to build on carpet. ) fig build: the magna guard head: (imo it's beautiful! ) the purple cone! cape box: the capes!: just one: the magnaguard: back: the parts (nicely sorted!) the new windshield piece (beautiful!) the first step: seccond step: more steps of the main body: the wing assembly: (sorry for the blur) attached: opposite wing: both attached: rear engine build: the staffs. i have mine set up differently than in the instructions. i put one cone over the hump on one end of the staff, and the other in the original spot. then, to load them onto the fighter, all you do is push the original placed cone down and put it right in. this way, the staff looks better and it works the same! see? it slides right in: skeletal parts of sides attached: close up: bottom: both wings attached: hidden missle launcher: raised up: another shot: staffs attached: complete: side panel: side pods: complete: swooshable!: finished!: time to complete: >2hrs. okay, overall rating time! price: 9/10- could have been 40.00 usd, but due to new molds, this is understandable. parts: 9/10- could have hade more dark red, but thats imo. plus, i love dark red! build time: 8/10- i took my time on this and enjoyed the techniques the designers intricated. also, taking pics added to the time quite a bit. playability: 7/10- the main playability functions are the missle launchers in the back and the sliding cockpit. my only gripe with these is they don't set right with the other slopes on the top. also, the inside of the cockpit is easily modded for regular size minifigs. just pop a handlebar piece in the already provided arm in the cockpit and bam, your favorite figs can have a ride! it also helps keep the magnaguards in place if they hold it. minifigs: 10/10- imo, the new molds are great! the only downfall is the right arm on both is less moveable due to the hard plastic turban-thing connected to the head. swooshability: 9/10- the starfighter is pretty sleek, and very swooshable! design: 9/10- the most important aspect, and this one's a winner! it's only a nine because it needs to have smoother edges in a few spots, but they are easily modable. overall score: 8.7! i think it's an awesome set. very satisfying! 2008 sw on! dsr dsr edited by kimt, 04 august 2008 - 11:49 am. indexed

1 fantastic review! it's very in-depth and i love it. i hope we'll see more reviews from you

1 hmm. a tougie. i really like the world city one, yet the dino one is a better deal. i'll vote for the dino, because i (regretably) don't even have the world city one...

1 the coast guard quad, because i live in the netherlands, and we don't have the 'dino attack theme', we have dino 2010, which have a diffrent quad. so i would like to chose the dino attack one, but as i don't one him, goast guard. though. but i also don't have the coast guard one, but i like him, but i also don't have the coast quard one as well. greets the-force! edited by the-force, 01 august 2008 - 11:18 pm.

1 , that was a weird race! anyway, i love the look of both sets, but i'll have to go for the dino attack quad for a couple of reasons: it is post-apoc, which i love, features tan and dark red colours which are far more useful than yellow, you get more "bang for your buck" with the dino set, you get a little dino (sure you can hate it but better than not having one right?), and the fig has much more useful pieces and a better face. thanks for the face off thebrickster! batbrick away!

1 i've got to go with the town one, since you have to stand on the dino one. steve

1 i vote for the dino quadbike, definately! i wish i had that but i'll have to make do with the much less violent european version (dino '2010' not 'attack') here's a comaprison... european version: usa etc. version: there's a subtle difference, but i prefer the us one as for the coast guard quad, i think it's ok but not as good as the new one.

1 i like the coast guard one, but dinos eat coast guard people, so dinos ftw. and i think the dino bike would fit in with my collection pretty well.

1 i like the dino thingy because of the pieces and the dino is a lot of fun on its own (i know, thats akward)...

1 dino attack for me! you just cant say no to a huge bazooka! though the tan and dark red works for me too

1 dino attack quad for me. no, this isn't because i own it and not the other one, but because i think just about everything is better in it - the design is better, the colors are cooler, and it has a better figure. i don't like the figure in the coast guard quad at all - but since it was from world city, i'm not suprised. i also kinda like the dino, actually. it's flexible and fits in with the previous dinos a lot better than the cruddy bigger ones with bright red, yellow, and green highlights.

1 ooooooh! this is a very hard choice,i like this new coast guard theme but i loved! dino attack.the dino attack set has a weird looking gun,but imo the coast guard set looks.........cleaner if you get what i mean.the little dino/lizard thing is practically worthless (thats why i have a bin full of those little guys).i want to keep liking dino attack i just can't.so i know your like "just get to the point already!" so i guess i have to go with coast guard. thebrickster, on aug 3 2008, 09:41 am, said: i did not know that europe had a different quad (or at least one without the bazooka). interesting that the gun was removed from the european sets, or added to the us sets. i sort of like the chain. i also notice a big difference in the boxart. destroyed city to prehistoric volcano. i wonder if the story was different as well? thanks for sharing a good picture. ----------------------------------------- well, it does look like the dino quad has the upper hand; almost double the votes. wow i would have so much wanted the european one more than the us one, i mean that bazooka or as they called it a "sonic screamer" looks very silly

1 price: 569 kr minifigs: 2 pieces: 592 stickers: 9 (my sticker sheet wasnt curled up) overview: before i start i will apologize for the bad quality of the pictures. it is getting dark here right now, so some of the pictures are a bit dark. 1) minifigs: the set comes with two of the new clone wars clone troopers, which in my opinion are pretty cool. it also comes with two short blasters and a bag of clone accessories. figs with helmets: figs without helmets: 2) the tank: this thing is huge (25cm long and 22cm wide), and far oversized in my opinion, but looks great nonetheless. i very much like the white and dark red color scheme, mixed with a bit of lime green (even though there is no lime green bricks ;) ). left side: right side: back side: both of the wings contain a hidden compartment to store the blasters and a part that rotates to reveal three flickfire missiles. the front opens up as well to reveal the engine. the side guns and the gun on the top rotate. inside the cockpit is space for two figs; one seated in front of two computer screens and one placed in a moveable seat, which moves up and down, allowing the fig to pop up the top hatch and staying hidden while the hatch is closed. this function is triggered by opening the backdoor. hidden compartment and missiles: engine: top hatch (open/closed): interior: 3) rating: build: 9/10 not much to say here. minifigs: 7/10 an extra fig or two would have been great; eventually a jedi or a commando. design: 8/10 this only looses a couple of points for being oversized, but its a great looking model. parts: 10/10 at 592 parts, this is one of the cw sets with the best parts/price ratio. price: 8/10 sure this thing is great, but i think its overpriced at 569 kr. (approx. $120). when build it feels more like a 450 kr. set. final verdict: 9/10 despite some flaws this thing is definitely recommended, and it looks great on your shelf, too ;)

-1 nice review , for portugal it costs 60. i also consider it oversized, it shold be the third of that size... portugal and spain may have good prices but 90 for the v-19 must be a tippo.

-1 finally a review of this, thanks! 120 bucks? this tank looks tiny and though it's amazingly detailed it should have been smaller and only 40/50 bucks at most. it just doesn't play that big a part man. good pieces and mechanisms but no one's going to both buying a 120 buck tank, no offence, not unless it it's the at-te.

1 thanks for the review! i think this is my favourite clone wars set, behind the republic gunship.

1 i'll probably get this in hong kong where lego is cheap next time i go there to visit my relatives. also pretty nice review, a few more pics couldn't hurt. also are there just two of the same white control computers for the controls? that's what it looks like in the instructions. edited by skipper 24, 01 august 2008 - 08:41 pm.

0 you lucky turd. seriously, good job with the review.

1 thanks for the review, christian, i was hoping for one soon . this set really looks good, but as you said, rather big. the figs are good, and i agree that ki-adi mundi should be included. i like the hidden compartments for the blasters and missiles, and the cockpit is really cool, considering it seats two (i thought only one). i will surely pick this up sometime.

0 deinonychus, on aug 1 2008, 08:06 pm, said: one question... do the top panels on the rotating rocket assembly mounted in the skids pop off regularly when you flip them back and forth? the ones on the version i built from the instructions posted online seem to eject with the slightest provocation they do fall off from time to time, but not as easily as you describe. skipper 24, on aug 1 2008, 08:13 pm, said: i'll probably get this in hong kong where lego is cheap next time i go there to visit my relatives. also pretty nice review, a few more pics couldn't hurt. also are there just two of the same white control computers for the controls? that's what it looks like in the instructions. yes. its two identical white slopes decorated with computer screens.

0 do you have any pics of the wheels? i wanna see what those are like.

1 this is my favorite set in the clone wars wave, and i'll be picking it up without a doubt... that is, whenever the folks at lego decide that it's okay for us to buy their sets in us.

1 must buy now!!!! totally sweet! not available in canada yet well designed and cheap (for clone wars!) i'm going to mod it so that it looks like the imperial version

1 this and the at-te and the spider tank and maybe the droid gunship are the few clone wars sets i'll buy. i loved playing as this tank in the clone wars video game( even better with cheat codes for extra missile spam ), so this is a must get.

-1 thanks for posting the review, ive been wondering about this set. to me it does feel a bit fig light, for 50 id expect maybe one or two more clones. im not to sure about the oversized issue, it seems to me its better to have something a bit to large and have a better level or features than something smaller will less.

0 this set costs a s$100 in singapore.i went to hng kong too see lego and the shops there are more expensive by a few dollars.however,i went to australia before and everything there is the same price but when there is a sale it becomes very cheap!anyway, thanks for the review!i was wondering about the details of this set.the clone's faces look a lot like anakin's face.why is that so?i thought it is supposed to look like jango's?

1 christian, thanks for this outstanding review! i have been waiting for this moment for someone to do up an excellent review like this. republic fighter tank is my 2nd favourite set, in my clone wars list. the 2 clone troopers could be easily add up to your rgs, since it offer only more trooper. however, i felt that this set is quite overpriced. in fact, all clone war sets are very expensive. the fighter tank, has a very great color combination of red and white to represent the republic. the wheels below is the most impressive feature, which enable the hovering feel. the hatch is a neat feature as well. however, i noticed there is a rubber band within the control panel. may i know what is it for? i really enjoy viewing this review. you had given the insight which will eventually determined whether to get it any sooner or later. pr0visorak, on aug 2 2008, 05:35 pm, said: this set costs a s$100 in singapore.i went to hng kong too see lego and the shops there are more expensive by a few dollars.however,i went to australia before and everything there is the same price but when there is a sale it becomes very cheap! hello pr0visorak. you are from singapore as well. welcome to eurobricks! i hope you will do an introduction to the rest of the members in this forum. in singapore, it cost sgd$100.00 in fact, that was the promotional price. therefore, there is no further discount for it.

1 im definatly gonna get the atte. im thinking about getting the spider droid and fighter tank. i alredy own the older version of the republic gunship (but i still want it) agentrick57, on aug 1 2008, 08:44 pm, said: i loved playing as this tank in the clone wars video game( even better with cheat codes for extra missile spam ) sorry to get off topic... but i own that game! i liked playing as the republic gunship the best!

0 good review. i would get this set, but sadly they don't have it anymore.... i wish they did to get those sweet figs! the battle droid colors are sweet! the only set with geonosians....

0 nice review. sadly my dark ages came right before this set was released.

0 thanks for the review. i love these affordable little sets. not so affordable now because of the cool figs but i'm going to have a look on ebay and bricklink right now just in case! an army of tan red droids would look great. maybe we'll see some if geonosia appears in the new seires somehow unlikely since the confederacy was defeated at the battle of geonosis. i wish i could have bought this set when it came out but i'd just left university so i was super skint and had to miss all the ep.ii sets now they all cost loads even in used condition. at least now there has been a re-design of the gunship and at-te from the clone wars series that i can buy.

1 great review! man doi wish i had those red droids. i'm using the dell xps-1, and holy crap is it clear. those pics were beautiful!

1 thanks for the review skipper. this is one of my favourite sets. i really like the colour scheme and the geonosians are awesome. keep up the good work kimt

1 i always thought this looked liek a cool set, with lots of nice (and sadly unique) pieces. unfortunately the only attack of the clones sets i got were the jedi starfighter and yoda vs dooku. amazing sets, but i would love to have owned them all. i'd never really looked into this set very much, so thanks for the review!

1 this is actually one of my favorite star wars sets. awesome rare pieces, and excellent construction. geo figs are a plus too. best of all, it's nice and cheap.

1 good review! i really liked the detailed geonosians, and i hope theyre in a later set so i can get more. knowing lego they'll release a huge arena playset with a few geos and sand red droids so people will buy the set just for them. jifel

1 i am fairly confident that something involoving geonosis will be released in 2010 but any way i had this set ( one of my first ones) but i droped the ship and it blew up. i found all the pieces but in never rebuilt the ship. although i still have the figs ant the canon. overall this set was above average in my opinion. great review!!!

-1 7263 tie fighter review parts: 159 figs: 2 price 20.00 (not sure) my 2nd review today! this set came out about the same time as the rots sets and included the first minifig to have a lul. 1. box & manual this is the front of the box, it has a try me slot for the lul vader. a close up of the try me slot. luckily i got mine form argos so no little kids have been playing around with it. the manual cover. i'm not quite sure why it has a pic of the figs on the front but it doesn't deface it so i don't mind. random manual shot. rots set preview at the back of the manual. 2. general set and figs the contents of the set. # the minifigs. a normal tie pilot and the first ever lul fig dv. (also my only lul fig) no helmets. tie pilot torso. the lul is made of 3 parts. lighted up. the led for the blade. 3. the tie fighter just a pic of it. cockpit with controls. tie pilot sitting in the cockpit. by the way the hinge brick is the wrong color it is supposed to be grey. the cockpit shut. i wonder why tlc never printed those cockpit glass things correctly. jet out the back. top plate has some nice printing. 5. overall build: 5/10 very repetitive...well the ships symmetrical! minifigs: 4/10 1 tie pilot which is okay but a lul vader he can't even fit in the ship. design: 6/10 strong but the wings are all wobbly if that makes sense. i don't like the blue either. parts: 6/10 lots of blue grills thingy's not much else but it got 6 because of the wings plates. price: 5/10 could have been more expensive. at least it had 2 figs. playability: 1/10 can't do much as a stand alone set. overall: 4/10 there just isn't enough here. it could at least have a better color scheme and instead of dv it could come with a stormie like the old one did.

1 great review! really shows off the main aspects of the set. wish i had picked up a tie when they were around... dsr

1 thanks for the review. i'll definately get this set sooner or later. imo the tiny turbos are awesome. i actually bought nearly every set so far, built the models, added the stickers and packed them away in zip-lock bags in the attic. sadly i don't have display room for them (yet). a fine set, carwise.. dump the slammers and buildings into the spare bag and keep the cars. kimt tiny turbos on!

1 looks like a pretty good set with a some nice colors. the spider is probably the best model in my opinion, but i mean look at the wasp kinda weak it you ask me. nice review .

0 4500 rebel snow speeder review parts: 214 figs: 3 price: 20.00 edit: new box pics added sorry they're a bit blurry because of the light i took them in. this is the original trilogy edition version of this set but there aren't any differences to the normal one. 1. manual & box the front of the ote box the minifgs on the box top. the back of the box with some alternate models and overview of some of the functions. the manual cover. you can see it is the ote version of the set. random shot. 1 of 2 posters in the instructions. the second poster. 2. general set and minifigs the built set contents. the three figs with the included weapons. how i like to customize the pilots helmets. luke from 4500 and luke from 10178 motorized at-at. the three helmets included with the set. 3. turret here's the turret with the rebel gunner standing next to it. the controls for the turret . the turret can rotate and tilt two fire at those pesky at-at walkers. i put a spider web sort of radar dish thing on like on the original 7130 to make it look more like the one from tesb. 4. the speeder a front view of the speeder. the pilot controls with a at-at print. the seats for the pilot and rear gunner. the rear gunner's tow cable. a detailed printed plate next to the engines. printed plates under the air-brake things. more printed parts, there is no dss with this set. got tie up those walkers. we might need some more tow cable . 5. overall build: 7/10 pretty symmetrical build but it's fun. minifigs: 8/10 3 figs in a 20 set is pretty good i think. design: 9/10 very strong and close to minifig scale. the turret could have some work though. parts: 8/10 lot's of variety and includes some interesting ones such as the cockpit and rear air vent. price: 7/10 3 figs and 214 parts not to bad i guess. playability: 6/10 could be better if it came with a snow trooper. overall: 8/10 the set comes with 3 figs that only come with more expensive sets, also it has a variety of different parts as well as the build being enjoyable. edited by skipper 24, 04 august 2008 - 03:10 pm. indexed

1 my review gave you motivation to build a set. my review was better than i thought.

0 there isn't much difference apart form it has stickers on and is grey. also the guns and tow cable gun are different as well as the engines. but if you look at pictures of the hoth base speeder not to much is noticeable.

0 i have mixed feelings about this set. it's one of the sets that sent my into a dark age (the birth of my son contributed heavily). when i first saw this set i was convinced that the earlier snowspeeder (7130) was superior in every way. i liked the look of the 7130 version better, i liked the coloration of it better. the turret was better (it used a webbed 6 x 6 dish). after seeing this review, i realize i was wrong on some accounts. the cockpit is much more movie accurate. the 7130 version had two separate compartments. this version also came with a tow cable, something that was lacking from the previous set. while i still am unimpressed with the overall look of this set, it is much less blocky, which is always a good thing. overall, i still prefer 7130 to the 4500 version. but the 4500 isn't nearly as bad as i first assumed, and i regret never buying one of these when i had my chance.

1 great review! i bought this set when it came out but sold it a couple years later for some extra cash. i have no regrets selling this one, as i was never really impressed with it (different story for the 4483 at-at - oh how i wish i still had that one). the snowspeeder was alright, just didn't have any sort of "wow" factor to it. the best part of the set is probably the rebel trooper. looking at the last photo in your review, looks like you're about to have a major battle in your hallway. apart from the snowspeeder & motorized at-at, i see the arc-170 fighter, grievous's starfighter, and is that a podracer i see -- and what is the set with the treads? it's not star wars, but looks like a pretty cool set (maybe a mission mars vehicle).

0 podracer not sure where you got that from (i didn't have them out)? the set with treads is a dino 2010 thing which fits in well after a bit of modding. also there are some of the old exo-force sets out there like the fire vulture because i always saw them fitting well with star wars.

0 skipper 24, on aug 4 2008, 12:52 pm, said: podracer not sure where you got that from (i didn't have them out)? i noticed the minifig between the grievous starfighter & the mod-dino2010 vehicle and it looked like a little person sitting in the pod of his podracer. guess my eyes are playing tricks on me -- my eyesight is shot & my wife keeps pushing me to go visit the optometrist.

0 nope there is a guy sitting there. he's there because on dine 2010 there were no guns like on dino attack, so so i made a big gun like on the dino attack set. i can see where you got the pod racer idea from now.

0 ahem! please get back on topic guys

1 i really liked this set. it was simple to build, yet detailed and included three figures, which was nice. if only lego would do a few more hoth sets, then we could make a real battle.

1 i find myself so stupid i didn't bought this set. it was 30 euro and i thought that it would be for sale after a half year. (it was with earlier sw sets also). nice review.

1 you have to love the originals, well i didn't like the very first snowspeeder so this is the original to me. i like it more then the new one that comes with the echo base, beter color scheme and more realistic i think. i got this set in stores and still love it to this day =]

1 good review, i like it a lot. nice job

1 this is one of my favorite sw sets. it is a good size to the hoth base and the at_at.

-1 not one of my favourite sw sets. kinda boring and the set is poorly designed imho. we do get the general, but that's not nearly enough. thanks for the reivew and fine pics. kimt

0 i had this set (15 rrp actually ;-)) and agree mostly with your review, although on the wheel bike itself two legs can be placed at the front end and two at the back to enable it to 'roll' properly. boga is very juniorised, and the set itself is very simple and contains many large pieces. the minifigures are good though (i traded my gg however ). just to offer my personal thoughts; build: 5/10 minifigs: 10/10 parts: 3/10 price: 7/10 playability: 10/10 overall 7/10 -- (not an average) tk

0 my brother had this set, and i think it isn't the best set, but great minifigs. could use a star corps clone or 2 from the bp.

1 7153 jango fett's slave 1 review parts: 358 figs: 2 price: 20.00 (i got it on offer i think the rrp was 40) the only set to include jango fett and young boba. also the decals on jango are from fine clonier. (i'm trying to say they don't came with the set) 1. manual worn manual. random page. another random page. looking at this page you can that this set has numbered bags. back cover. look how old yodas computer looks . 2. general set and minifigs the sets contents. jango with his hair on. jango with helmet on with front view of face. twist jango's head to initiate super bounty hunter mode. jango's doubled sided head. boba. nothing to special although i think the torso and head are exclusive to the set. 3. the ship not really scaled up right as you can see. the guns can rotate. the central sections interior. not sure what this is. is it a hyperdrive or a bomb or something? there are these side panels on both sides. behind the panels. a secret compartment. trans orange minifig heads in the compartment. i think they're supposed to be saturnic charges. side storage compartment. the back of the ship. how those trans orange minifig heads fallout. there is a magnet on the inside of the ship. but for what... the secret prison which also has a magnet on the top so it can stay on but easily come out. the doors on it can lift up to put prisoners inside. 1 of 2 identical wing things. they can fold for flight mode. the controls. bottom jet thing. let me out of here! the prison is great for capturing small children. 4. overall build: 7/10 impossible to build without a hard stable surface. minifigs: 10/10 2 exclusive figs. design: 7/10 nowhere near to scale but has some nice features. parts: 8/10 good parts like that big cockpit canopy. price: 9/10 for the price i got it was pretty good especially with the figs it comes with. playability: 7/10 lots of features but it would be better if it came with a jsf. overall: 9/10 lots of features and comes with exclusive minifigs. edited by kimt, 04 august 2008 - 11:44 am. indexed

0 thanks again skipper for producing yet another review to go into the index. i like this slave1, but sadly i must admit that i like the really old version better. boba fett's slave1 that is, even though is grossly undersized i think it's better than this one belonging to his father jango. kimt

0 i never got the original boba fett's slave 1. i wish they would make one to scale with the minifigures. i would be so cool. i am also putting up a review of the clone turbo tank probably tomorrow. it is a different variation to the one in the index. edited by skipper 24, 03 august 2008 - 07:12 pm.

-1 personally, i hated that set. i fell apart way to easily and was just not built well.

0 very good review! there's only one thing you did wrong: [quote name='skipper 24' post='337180' date='aug 3 2008, 08:46 am']the controls. i got this set for a very low price as well, and for that, it's a very nice parts pack with 2 neat, exclusive figs!

0 very good review! i have he newest slave i and i like it more than this one. dsr

0 okay i have fixed that pic (thanks oky wan). i have modified this but then yesterday i built it back to its original state to review it.

0 i really want one of these, if only it wasn't expensive. i probably won't buy it because it'd be scraped for parts too quick. great review though.

1 a very nicely done review. i remember getting this slave i - it was my first large star wars set.

1 outback desert racer g'day mates! today from the legoland's desert down under, i'll be sharing an image review of outback set #6550, desert racer set #: 6550 theme: outback year released: 1997 piece count: 48 minifigs: 1 list price: $4 (usd) starting with an image of the box: and the back side with three alternate models: instructions and decals: the pieces: a side view of the vehicle: diagonal view: one minifig: and the complete set: pros: - price is under $5 ($4 usd retail) - good impulse set - goes well with other outback sets - combination of yellow and green pieces - working doors and liftable top for playability cons: - stickers on doors, hood, and 1x4 tile. no printed pieces - no accessories (a wrench, gas can, and other extras would have added to the set) - no extra tire for blow outs summary: i picked this set up new a number of years ago as a true "impulse buy", after buying one of the larger outback sets (amazon crossing or outback airstrip). it's a neat little addition to the theme with its working doors and playability factor. although i only built it once before today, i would buy again if i had the opportunity. hooroo for now! some good aussie music to leave you with: down under

1 this set looks liek a good buy for $4. wish it was still around, but like you said, it needs accessories.

0 i can prodly say i own this little bugger. it's not much, but it is a nice addition to the series. they are also easy to build, so you can get a rally going quite fast. stauder.

1 7261 clone turbo tank parts: 801 figs: 8 price: 70.00 (ouch! ) edit: new box pics added. my version of the set comes with a normal mace windu figure and an extra clone trooper. also the mace windu, barc trooper and jet trooper minifigs were exclusive to the set (well you could make the jet trooper yourself) . also my set came with 4 extra blasters (you'll see them later) and baby blue vent things instead of trans blue. 1.manual & box the front of the box. the box compared to the motorized at-at and the hailfire droid and dwarf spider droid. minifgs. the back which has pics of the sets functions and alternate models. inside the box it has a white cardboard divider probably for strength seeming as the box it so flimsy. pretty hefty manual. the tt manual compared to the one of the at-at ones. random shot. another random shot. poster at the back of the manual 2. general set and minifigs the whole set. i accidentally left one of the plates up when i took the pic. close up of the figs. two battle droids come with blasters and a mini turret. the republic. from l-r: jet trooper, mace windu (not lul), barc trooper, normal clone, the commander, look out. jet pack. mace's torso. barc trooper legs. barc trooper torso. he has got to be my favorite clone trooper by tlc. the mysterious commander. on lsw he was called cody (right) but he has star corps armour making him commander bly (left) . normal clone and the look out clone with electro binoculars. 3. speeder bike side view of the barc speeder. menacingish front view. (is menasingish a word?) printed back engine piece. one of my shield things came with a crumpled handle it is worse than it looks in the pic. 4. the turret the turret. it can rotate and point upwards. but what if you want to blast all those battle droids that are shorter than the height of the turret blasters... add another hinge in! that extra hinge in action. 5. the tank it's to big to get a decent side view pic johnny the cabin boy on the crows nest. front 2 seater cockpit. the 2 seats. better be careful you don't fall off your seat there are some pretty big gaps down the sides. back cockpit with dual missile launchers. the back seat. the engine. the large central storage. the turret controls fold down to lock into place so it doesn't fall out when driving. you can put 2 minifigs up top. mace and a clone driving. you can see those 4 extra blasters, 2 orange at the front of the pic and 2 between the chairs. the turret and jet trooper. barc trooper on the barc speeder. the commander on the lift chair in the back cockpit. another shot of that chair. 6. overall build: 8/10 quite enjoyable because it incorporates technic and system parts. minifigs: 9/10 on a set this size it has quite a lot including some exclusives such as the barc trooper but it could of had a droid or 2 more. design: 7/10 way out of scale but generally pretty strong due to the technic frame. parts: 7/10 lots of plates and nice minifig parts. price: 6/10 justifiable because of the amount of figs in the set. playability: 7/10 includes some cis units to fight the clones. overall:8/10 needs more droids and it could be bigger. i will also probably have a break form reviewing for now seeming as i have just put out a whole load of reviews. edited by kimt, 09 august 2008 - 08:51 pm. indexed as 7261 review 2

1 nein! you rejected lul. lul's are awesome! thanks for the review! i like the set a lot, mace is only featured here. great fig of him too, i like the grey jedi robes torso. cody is great as with the other figs. the tank's probably a second favourite, next to the mighty at-at of course.

1 i got the original version of this set with the luls mace windu figure. when tlc released the non-luls version i managed to swap - they sent me the new version (and a clone trooper iirc) and i mailed them back the old version. this was a great set; the suspension worked great and it rolled magnificently. nice review with good photos, but again your price is a little off: 69.99 is the rrp (unless the price you paid was 80). tk

0 hanks for the price. i got the set a while ago and couldn't remember correctly i have now changed it.

0 skipper 24, on aug 4 2008, 04:04 pm, said: did your version without the lul mace have trans blue grill things (like the ones on the back of the speeder) ? or was my set a one off. i bought mine online, thinking it was the new version but i ended up with that very lame lul fig. i just hate that fig... it's completely useless, we can't use any part of it for anything (although, i only discovered yesterday that the lightsaber blade was a standard one and not glued, as i always believed, so all isn't completely lost) in the end i still was rather disappointed by the set. it's too full of holes ( hum; i think there's kind of a paradox in that sentence...)... but the barc speeder and green clone are indeed fantastic. oh, and yes, mine came with sand blue grill parts instead of the trans-yellow ones... didn't realise it at first, and i spent half an hour cursing, thinking they forgot to put them in the box. but in the end, i don't know if the replacements are any better , since they're supposed to represent some kind of thruster light or something... all in all, i think it's my worst set... not necessarily for the set itself which is ok, but psychologically, there's too many things that went wrong with it...

0 thanks for the review kimt. i gave this "above average". i believe i had this one, but it was so long ago... i'm still a bit freaked out by the yellow ones! when i emerged from my dark ages i kept thinking "gee, i miss the people packs", but now that i have over 500 mini-figures i don't feel that way anymore. even so, i wish they would re-release some of the classic old ones.

0 i voted "above average" as well, but back in 1983, i would have probably gone much lower. sadly, i wasn't as interested in minifigs at the time. i appreciated the ones i had, but i really just wanted ships or bases, and would have gladly passed this by for something with one or two figures and a small moon rover. i skipped all of the classic minifig sets, space, castle and town. it was only upon coming out of my dark ages that i went minifig crazy. for me, this is above average because of the accessories. without them, it's an average set. with a small brick built droid or a rover, it would be outstanding. that said, i'd buy at least 10 copies now, though i'd rather have a 4 figure set with one of each colour including blue. i never had blue back then. i think castle lured me away. thanks for an interesting review! it gives me a chance to further explore why i changed from ship/set to minifig fan and bore all of eb with it.

1 an ancient set revived from kimt's collection! just take a look at the box art. this is one classic space minifig pack which deserve high rating, and i gave it above average. i never had any of these classic space figs before. if tlg could ever released this again, i am pretty sure i will grab multiple packs without a glimpse. you need to build your space agents/astronauts with a little bit of accessories added to explore the unknown space. i love this pack very much. thanks for sharing!

0 i wonder why this set had no blue or black astronauts? whatever the case, i always loved the small minifig sets that lego released, as i could never get enough astronauts. my favorite was the set of futuron astronauts. why would the yellow astronauts freak you out, sinner? is it because they look nekkid? ;-)

1 pretty nice set, but the newer minifig packs had greater variety in both the figures and equipment. my favorite one among all of them is 6704, which is also the only instance of both blacktrons appearing in one set. quote i wonder why this set had no blue or black astronauts? whatever the case, i always loved the small minifig sets that lego released, as i could never get enough astronauts. my favorite was the set of futuron astronauts. i think the blue and black guys hadn't yet been released at the time of this set.

0 lol, i don't know what's going on there!

1 7674 v-19 torrent number of pieces: 471 number of minifigs: 1 price: 49.99 the v-19 torrent starfighter was an assault fighter with exceptional speed and maneuverability used by the galactic republic during the clone wars.it was a predecessor of the alpha-3 nimbus-class v-wing starfighter, in terms of purpose and usage. it first appeared in the genndy tartakovsky?s clone wars 2d series. basics box front: the box art shows the torrent flying above tatooine, with the new blue and white ?clone wars?? style packaging, box back: the back shows some of the features of the set including the lifting mechanism and adverts for 7679 republic gunship, 7675 at-te and the 7673 magnaguard starfighter inside the box, there are 2 instruction books, a very small dss and 9 bags that are not numbered. bags: instruction books random manual shot parts list book one is mainly the construction of the body and one of the engines, book 2 is the other engine and the wings. for better pics of the manual look on lego's website. sticker sheet: a very small sticker sheet is included, which includes 2 republic insignias and a nose sticker. minifigure one minifigure is included, a clone pilot. the whole "omg only one minifigure in this set" and "its not movie accurate, i hate you tlc!!!11one2" has been beaten to death, so please don't make this review turn into that and to be honest i don't care because its an awesome figure. tlc have made the effort to print the life support device onto the chest plate so props to them. he has the "clone head" like the rest of the clones have in the cw releases, there are no extra clone bits apart from a long blaster, that's not included here. interesting/other pieces printed piece! rare/unusual pieces: there are 2 pistons included, as well as 2 weird looking technic pieces that serve as the landing gear during the build. which might explain why the set is quite expensive, it musn't have been cheap to manufacture them. the build it starts off relatively simple, the first 16 steps is getting the basic shape of the cockpit and the mechanism to make the middle wing move up and down. after that the next few steps are getting the landing gear/wing folding device done, it's actually the same thing so when the wings move into attack mode the landing gear retracts. this is then locked into place by the white beams that form the basic shape of the fuselage. up to step 46 is the fuselage, as well as fitting the hydraulics. this is what it looks like when the fuselage is complete. the cockpit is not "air tight", there's is quite a big gap top: bottom: the final few steps of book 1 is the construction of one of the engines, here it is attatched : the yellow bar is not permanent, its used to keep the white bit at the top from moving downwards. the steps are repeated in the second book so that both engines are now in on to the wings! first one attatched, the middle one is attached now: and finally the last one: it is now finished! the pieces that are left: so, you're probably wondering, how does it enter attack mode? well can you see this bar? push that bar to the center, and pick it up, the hydraulics move the central wing downwards as well as the side wings to enter attack mode: the outer wings have flickfire missiles on them, they obviously don't work, but it increases the playability of the set. the cockpit opens in a similar way to general grevious's starfighter released last year, using a sliding mechanism for other pics see here : http://s25.photobuck...eview/?start=20 and i'll be taking other requests for pics, maybe a video of it switching between modes. build: 7/10 very symmetrical build, the mechanism to move the wings might annoy some people. minifigs: 5/10 1 fig in a 50 set, however it is a starfighter design: 9/10 very accurate to the source material, lego have really made the effort to make the movement feature work. parts: 8/10 lots of technic, white and dark red pieces price: 7/10 could be slightly cheaper, playability: 6.5/10 need to buy some enemy sets to get the most of it, flick fires don't work. comments, requests, questions and criticisms welcome. edited by kimt, 04 august 2008 - 06:48 pm. indexed and poll added

0 i'm still reviewing it, the internet broke half way through it

0 simonjedi, on aug 4 2008, 05:57 pm, said: i'm still reviewing it, the internet broke half way through it the internet broke? that's bad news to all. did you push this? i am eagerly awaiting the rest. kimt

1 first, thanks simonjedi for a great review. i'm interested in what you think of the hydrolics. i could spend hours just deploying and undeploying the wings and landing gear. i'm a little worried, the very first batch of the hydrolic piece for, umm, i think it was the off-road 4x4 technic set, was very fragile and broke after a few uses. these seem to be holding up but i'm anxious to see if they hold up after 100-200 uses. quote name='walter kovacs' date='aug 4 2008, 11:47 am' post='337841'] those black pieces used on the landing gear look very bionicle-like. if they haven't been used before, i'd suspect they will be. not that i'm a bionicle expert or anything. [/quote] right you are. they are bionicle bohrok head pieces. so pretty old in bionicle terms and fairly useless in my opinion but they do make interesting looking landing gear as i deploy and redeploy the wings and landing gear. hopefully, we'll get a pilot in the battle pack to help mitigate the fact we only get one here. -tohst

0 the printed part isn't new it came with 10178 motorized at-at walker. also nice review, i would get the set if it was a little cheaper or came with more than 1 fig. whyhas it got 2 instruction books the set isn't particularly big?

1 thanks for the review. i've added it to the index and added a poll in which members can vote their opinion on this set. i think this is a very good set. i like the colours and the very playable feature that allows the wings to lock in attack formation. now all i need is to buy this baby. edit: i gave it an above average rating, since it's well designed, looks sturdy and fits the sw theme sets perfectly.

1 nice review simon jedi. the v-19 has been one of my favourite ships since the release of cwa and this is one of the sets i've been considering most about buying. it's great to see tlg's treatment of it. it looks like no expense was spared making it as aesthetically and functionally accurate as possible - though i think the cockpit windshield could maybe have been slightly bigger, but that's just me i'm sure. it looks pretty big compared to other starfighters too. did it take a long time to build?

-1 great review simonjedi -- i really like that you included lots of photos of your build. i put together my v19 torrent last night, and i was surprised by how heavy the completed ship is. it has some real heft. once it's finished, wow! it is a really cool ship. i was disappointed that the central wing doesn't really lock into place once it flips down. it just kind of droops there, so i attached a technic pin to the locking arm so it could plug into the 2x4 brick that's on the underside of the starfighter (this brick can be seen in your photo of the bottom of the ship). overall, the build is one of the more confusing that i've seen (i had to dismantle and re-build the first engine after i realized i'd left out a piece) and i kept thinking of the poor 7-year-old that gets this set as his/her very first lego set ever.

1 the v-19 was my first tcw set. i buyed it, when i was visiting my father. i just wanted to build it there, and i do so. but how do you will get sth.big like this with in the train?? so i had to destroy him. when i was still home again, i had to build it 3 times, because the mechanic dont works i only can say that the v-19 is one of the best tcw sets. thanks to you for the review simonjedi , i just wanted to make one in german. but now i needn`t to make it

1 thanks for this excellent review simonjedi . this looks like an awesome set and this is the set i am most looking foward just as well as the separatist spider droid (7681) .

1 the ability for it to fold in and out of attack position has wowed me. this is my top priority now. thanks for making up my mind.

1 hydraulic wings! i am very impressed and am now considering getting this set purely because of this funciton. i am just curious as to know why are there sand green parts on the bottom of the v-19. is it visible when the model is completed? i am also pleased to see tlc giving us a printed cockpit computer this time around.

0 kimt, on nov 30 2008, 10:01 am, said: all you need to do is build it correctly yes. yes i do. i'm just kind of lazy. it just didn't work out for me is all.

1 i love this set and i gave it "outstanding". i might note though that the cylinder is just there as a dampener; when disenegaged the wing function still works, just not as smoothly. interestingly though the cylinder is an old piece, (i have a few others) it's just that this is the first time it's been used without a spring... i had no problems assembling this set.

1 having just bought myself a copy of the wonderful metroliner (4558) i felt like doing a review. before we start i'd like to thank greenhair for selling me one of his metroliners for a mere 80 euros. granted, the motor, "trainstation" and tracks weren't included but i did get an extra railcar instead. - * (please note that i have included the fourth wagon in the final pic but that the official set includes just three wagons.) the metroliner was released in 1992 and was extremely popular amongst lego fans. the set a picture of the box showing the set completely. (pic taken from peeron) and one of the minifigs and the accessories.: as you may notice, tlc was extremely generous, supplying us with a grand total of 11 minifgs amongst which no less than 4 female minifigs. ah, the population crisis is finally over we also have three suitcases, three cups and a small freight parcel and freight handling thingy. normally this would include two bicycles; a red and a black one. a general side view of the three carriages. (thanks to greenhair and the brickster) and here's one of the extra carriage. (thanks to greenhair and the brickster) moving onto the front and back carriage, which are externally identical. please note that greenhair changed my back carriage's headlights. these would be yellow in the normal set. all the doors in the entire set are printed pieces. (sorry for the bad picture quality in this one) the interior of the two however is laid out a bit differently. the space in the front carriage is occupied by a cockpit (or whatever it is called in trains) and some space to store your cable connecting the front lights with the engine. i can imagine it must get quite cramped and dangerous for the minifig driver with all the cabling. further back we have a quite random, weird looking engine. one part reminded me rather of a jet engine on a commercial airplane. the engine is accessible by means of the two side cargo doors. at the end of our first carriage we hit what looks like the train's restaurant, two tables and no chairs. the two middle carriages are identical, both have a small sink nicely hidden from the intervening and impolite looks of fellow passengers. the carriage further contains two tables and four seats. two cargo spaces are nicely tucked away from view below the tables. our final carriage has a back cockpit as well but differs from the front carriage in the central cargo area - where our train employee is hard at work earning his lego nickels - and the rear sleeping area. the bed is a double one, the upper one able to be flipped up for somewhat difficult access to the lower one. the train station i could not take photos off since it was not included in the purchase. judging from the building plans however i feel it was thrown in at the end just to add 'something' to the set. its construction is very simple, consisting of a few grey plates on top of a few pillars. access is provided by a plate which is connected to the platform with a few hinges. there are however two lamp posts, a timetable and a few chairs so if you don't like the platform you can still use these parts in a variety of other constructios. to end off i took a pic of the complete set (with extra wagon) and a friendly surprised train driver opening the door and greeting the camera man. conclusion being a '90s set, the train basically builds itself. the entire build cost me two hours and a half (i lost quite some time simply admiring the set) and was extremely straightforward with no suprises at all, but i need to admit it has its charm. the exterior is simply amazing. the sleekness of the design, the colours, it matches perfectly! i believe however that a width of 8 studs would be more to scale but 6 wide still looks amazing. the interior is somewhat simplistic but is easily moddeable with a few extra pieces. i basically bought the train as a parts pack. the standard set (three wagons) includes no less than 8 train doors with windows, 14 train windows, 4 smaller longer ones and 4 freight doors. the front and back of course count as unique pieces as well. one feature i am displeased with are the printed doors. i like printed pieces and while the blue-white-red stripe looks beautiful on the side the printed doors kind of limit mocing capabilities to carriages with a stripe on the side. i considered simply removing the stripe but i found out i could just get normal grey ones from bricklink for a fair price. i am very pleased with the train but since you already know my opinion, feel free to tell us yours of this fabulous set! edited by thebrickster, 09 july 2009 - 01:51 pm. poll question was not multiple choice, switched to radio group

1 i remember to literally jump of joy when my grand-father offered it to me for christmas... it's an amazing set, the train is really beautiful and it comes with 11 (!) mfs, so can somebody ask for more?

1 oh ruben you lucky so and so this set is one of the most beautful i have ever seen! splendid looking build and 11 figures, all the same faces like but still you get that old woman pig-tail head piece which is just great! i thought you meant the monorail set when you told me about this but guess i was wrong (don't laugh i've been away from lego for quite some time) and for 80 euros it was a real bargain from a great friend! really nice review hope this sets brings you years of joy!

1 cool review. i actually have two of these. i got one for christmas when it was rereleased in 2003 and another one in a charity shop a few months later for 5. i love the minifigs even if they all have smileys, and having two sets of them can really fill up a town.

1 i'm not normally that big into trains but this set has a real coolness factor that sets it apart from most of the others. the color scheme is the same one that amtrak and many local subway systems use. i picked it up along with the club car expansion when they were re-released in 2001. i have made various modifications to mine, rearranging the car layouts and adding a second train motor into the rearmost car along with another set of lights, so that both ends light up. as you said, it would be great to have an 8-stud version of this, so you could fit in two rows of seats side by side. that might make a nice mod project at some point.

1 outstanding train set. the legend of the entire train series, is the metroliner. this is a "super 5" set. the color, design, minifigs is just so perfect and lovely. it resemble the trains which we see on our rails in our daily life. i can't find any flaws on this at all. the only flaw i noticed is my mistake of not able to buy this set at all. in fact, i had never seen this set in the shops before in my entire life. thebrickster, on aug 5 2008, 09:23 am, said: how cool is that? and 11 minifigs - when was the last time lego included 11 figs in a single set? there is another set fufil the criteria above, which is also a well known legend. it has 12 minifigs which is the 10159 city airport aka century skyway airport.

1 ahh, the good old train theme. how i wish tlg would make such great trains today, now that the quality of city sets has improved so much. that really brings back memories, even if i didn't have this one, but a cargo train that came out about the same time period, maybe plus a few years. i don't have any trains myself at the moment, mostly because i'm afraid i haven't got enough space to put in on display with all the rails and stuff.

1 really nice train, i always wished tlg would have made the passenger ir train longer and maybe used some of the nice features of this train, i still love that faucet piece.

1 i got my indy exclusive in the mail today. packaging front: back: instructions: mini-figs this set comes with 1 mini-fig, the standard indy with hat and whip-no satchel: the build i am really happy with the amount of frown headlight bricks that come with this set. 12 in all: the mudguards are cleverly built with 1 x 2 panels and 1 x 1 panel corners in dark green. in the first 2 pages of the instructions, there are a lot of great pieces. this set would sell like mad if it were released for sale. parts monkeys alone would go insane buying these up for the dark green and frown pieces: the body of the car consists of black plates, brackets and modified bricks with curved tops that allow the dark green mudguards to just peak out. cool technique: the grill looks cool using only six pieces. i wish all small sets were this unique and cool: here's the completed jeep. it looks a little small for an actual jeep, but for a brickmaster set, it's awesome, imo: some more detail shots of the set with indy in the driver's seat: i hope they take brickmaster exclusives overseas because it'd be awesome if everybody could get these. my buddy copmike would probably love to be the first to review this set, so i've dedicated my review comic to him: my rating playability: 8/10 (you need to add some other sets and characters to really play with this set) design: 9/10 (great techniques and inclusion of rare parts, but loses a point for being an unrealistic size for a jeep) price: 10/10 (part of the brickmaster package, it is a reasonable prize for an exclusive set and everything else that comes with the subscription) overall: 9/10 (great, but not perfect and definitely needs to be offered overseas. lego would make a ton of money releasing this for sale, imo as it really is a terrific small set.)

1 super review, thanks. simply put, i'd have to admit this is one of the best indy sets. and in such a small package. it's a very detailed lil' jeep, and that's why i like it. i have this too, but i don't want to open it since it's exclusive. wait, i thought we were calling it "rown" and not "frown"

1 thanks for the review hinckley! i love this set! i still haven't renewed my bm subscription, but i'm sure i can find this on ebay or bricklink. and what an addition this would be to my army. edited by ~vbbn~, 05 august 2008 - 01:32 am.

1 outstanding set and review, thanks for presenting it! i've had this since it first came out, but didn't think it would be that impressive, so i didn't bother opening it. now, i'm tempted. aside from the slight size issue, i can't find anything here to gripe about, except for the limited availability. i want 5. i think that makes me a parts monkey. eek eek. you're exactly right about this selling like mad. it's another one of those missed opportunities for tlg. sure, it's nice to get people to subscribe by offering it as part of brickmaster, but in the long run, put it in the stores for $6 and sell a million. just give us indy's manbag, we need it for postal employees and such. as is the running joke whenever i comment on one of your reviews, i'd give this a solid 985. not out of anything, just 985. or, in clearer terms: + 1/2 (though i voted 5)

1 nice review! i would like to get this set... unfortunately i don't get brickmaster mag, and the prices on bl/ ebay will most likely be ridiculous. i wonder why indy doesn't come with his murse (man purse) in this set? thats the best part of the fig. the jeep itself is very nice, especially with the dark green. by the way, what is frown? brownish... something, i guess. oh yeah, and funny comic.

1 looks really nice, if they keep making bm sets like this, i might actually subscribe... nice comic too, remind me not to run into copmike and his gloveless hand...

1 i really enjoyed getting this set in the mail. its such a great small set and a good example of how smaller vehicles can have great details on them too. the only drawback is that i didn't get another satchel for my various uses for them.

1 thanks for the cool review, hinckley. when i saw the picture originally i thought it looked good, but not that good. but seeing the pictures in your review, i love this, i voted it as outstanding because it has great parts, and a brilliant construction, ingenious perhaps! sirnadroj, on aug 5 2008, 02:30 am, said: simply put, i'd have to admit this is one of the best indy sets. i agree. it's so sad we europeans can't get it...

1 thanks for this great review hinckley! i agree with you this set has to be released as normal set. i just recognized how clever the building technique is, you couldn't see that on the packaging shots we got before. hopefully i'm able to grab this off ebay or somewhere else sometime!

1 surprisingly well designed set for lego overlords... i mean brickmasters!

1 6804 surface rover review set#: 6804 set name: surface rover released: 1984 pieces: 16 minifigs: 1 (white classic space minifig) brickshelf gallery peeron.com bricklink brickset.com introcomment: i have to keep my fondness for space going and since i'm no fan of the still "new" life on mars mars mission theme, i've decided to give you another review of a small classic space set. more to come in the following days. the box. unfortunately i haven't got the box for this set. but peeron.com was kindly enough to support me with a proper pic. and as usual this is a small easily brought home sized box. oddly tlg doesn't add the "flip" on top anymore. i remember standing in toystores, pulling 6 or more sets down from the hanger before accesing the one i wanted. it gave buying lego sets that threasure hunting touch. [snaps out of his daydreaming]... a small box with a picture of what you get. i've got no rear pic, so i can't tell if tlg did the same as on the 6701 set (split up the inventory). the fig: one single white classic space minifig. this is the worst one in my opinion. i never liked those white guys. and they get easily damaged by the sun. nah! give me a red or yellow instead (later blue or black). the surface rover: both i am the lucky owner of two of them. (yes this is a small showoff ) side though small, i still think this is a neat little set. compared to the modern "impulse" sets, this is high competable. i like the simplicity of the small classic space sets and this is no exception. the sr is made from very usable bricks, that can easily be used for making ship/base/craft mocs. rear as you can see, one of them has been used for surface exploration for many years. it could do with some replacements, but i haven't had the time, yet. the verdict: a fine little classic set. not much more than that. it holds some useful bricks and worked fine as an "impulse" back then. the classic children's birthday presents during the early 80's. i got quite a few space and town sets back then. remember to vote your opinion on this set. i gave it "average" for the bricks, the price (back then) and as an all in all conclusion. kimt

1 this set easily is above average for me. i had this as a little child, and whenever any of my relatives came to visit us, they brought me some lego. usually it was either this set or 6844 the really nice thing about this set are the alternate builds. for the low price you got a nice range of parts and cool ideas what to build with them. you could build a fleet of rovers, or the alternates, and everytime it was huge fun :)

0 i voted average. it's a cute set, and one which i built from parts many times as a kid. (i didn't own the set though.) thanks for the review!

1 thanks for this review, if you'd only know what memories you brought back! i think i remember this set better than any other i had, when i was a child. some time after i got it, i decided to disassemble it and combine it with the jeep from 6552 rocky river retreat. it came out pretty good, though. as it became the main attraction point of my town (beeing the car of my favourite minifig back then, and, and, and... looong story ), i kept it assembled that way from this day on until earlier this year, when i finally disassembled it because i needed the parts. edited by metalandi, 06 august 2008 - 03:57 am.

1 this is by far my favourite outback series set! i loved the fact that you can bend the bridge in different directions so that the suspension of the car really worked to keep the car levelled, like you placed it in your last picture. i had lots of fun with this when it came out eleven years ago in 1997, the bridge scene could also be used in the adventurers serie of 1998. classic, highest rating, buy it if you don't already have it!

1 a nice set to go with the outback theme. i am kind of dissapointed they they didint continue the theme, as i only managed to grab 6487 and 6550, none the less, this set is very interesting as it's one of the few to feature working suspention. stauder.

1 great review brickster why exactly did the outback, adventure etc. themes never quite catch on......just a thought. what a great set! i wish i had it, but in 1997 i was just back from my whirl wind trips around the world and had drifted away from lego i don't know why. but i will say this i love the actual suspension that came with this set and the trains sets i have been trying to buy up as much of it as i can, and now i see i need to add one more set to the "i need to get that"

1 nice review. this set looked very nice for it's time.

1 oh i loved this set when i was young! i think i got it for my birthday, and it was one of my favourite sets at the time. funnily enough, i was thinking about it the other day, and how i really should build it again... thanks for the nostalgic review.

0 ok, this is the big one. the controversial one. the one everyone either hates or defends... what do i think? read on. the figs: bandana man masked dude dude with shades good figures, i miss scarface. comes with his torso, though, which is my favorite (the one with the ammo strap across the chest). one figure short of the figure-to-price value, but we can deal with that. the dino: the dino. it's the one that comes with the chopper, in green. any questions? the tank: and so it begins. i think it looks a lot better in person than on the box. the left side. good time to mention that the treads run pretty easily, and this is a very playable set. right side. keep an eye on that flap in the center... ... and we have a folding ladder! the back. probably the weakest point of the set, apart from the dino. the turret, turned and tilted. the mechanism works extremely well, and the gun seems to work better than others for some reason (or maybe it just seems that way). the front of the cockpit. i'm at a loss trying to figure out how those tiny windshields defend them against 40-foot mutant tyrannosaurus rexes with radioactive breath, laser eyes, and what have you... anyway, another one of those neat steering wheels, some viking horns, and some stickered control panels (oh yeah, this set has a good amount of stickers. probably around 20-ish.). the back of the cockpit. i love the little gun, it turns 360 degrees and tilts up. oh yeah, and those green barrels they've been using are awesome, i can think of tons of uses for them. the verdict: 7.6/10 playability: 9.4/10 pieces: 7.5/10 figures: 8.8/10 dino: 3/10 value: 4/10 the main downfall of this set is the price. i would easily pay $30 for this, no questions asked. but $40 was a hard sell for me - i gave in merely to see what i would think of it, and also to help you guys find out the same. this is a great display set, and a great play set. the pieces are good - lots of nice blay beams used in the construction. but the price, people. that's the killer. pick this up only if you have everything else or you find it on clearance. and thus ends my dino attack review series. hope you enjoyed them! until next time, bloody jay

1 tks for the review once more jay ;) i totally agree with you jay !!! this set has very nice details suche as the mini gun, movable ladder, green barrels and great figs !!!! however, it is very expensive for what it is and i don't think there are that many very usefall parts in there !!!! (well, i could use those treads !!!). if i ever buy this set, its really not for the design, which i totally dislike...

1 thanks for the reviews once again. it looks like qite a nice set to me, although the european version will lose the big gun. i like some of the stickers (although i wish they were printed), and i actually quite like the dinosaur. i probably won't get it though, the set i'm most likely to get is the fire hammer.

0 heh...$40? you're lucky...they sell those for $60 here...am i getting ripped off?

0 this is my first review, so i thought: the smaller (the set), the better! 6626 snowmobile year: 2000 subtheme: arctic pieces: 20 (+1 extra) note: polybag; 6577 is the boxed version price: .1 + s/h on ebay misp (mint in sealed polybag!) building time: less than 2 minutes. if it came out in the last months, if would be called an impulse set. it actually came out a few years ago; being those my "dark years", i missed the arctic line. now that i'm back into business, i wanted some! but not all of the sets were good (or easily available). i had the chance to buy this one, and i0'm happy with it. as you can see below, it consists of a figure on a scooter; the only accessories are those chainsaws that lie on the sides (unless you take the skis from the scooter and have the minifig wear them!). the extra piece is a transyellow 1x1 round plate. according to brickset and peeron, the difference between box and polybag is the sticker "sheet". you choose whether the nose is better with or without the sticker: i'd say "with". the judgement: it's cheap, it has a cool minifig with a cool head accessory and a nice torso. i don't think i like that orange colour that much (and i can't understand why those blue pieces have to be... blue; i guess it's beacuse the whole line uses blue with orange!), but i have to say this is definetely a good set. i'd give it a 4 out of 5 in its category. if you want to own at least a set per every theme, this could be your arctic one. packaging: content: minifig (i hear you ask: what's that yellow thing on the left leg? dust, or something alike): the snowmobile: edited by the cobra, 07 august 2008 - 02:33 pm.

1 here we are, my first clone wars set, and my first star wars review. here we have the wonderful droid gunship, one of the cheaper of the clone wars sets. this set is exclusive to wal-mart, and its one of the better exclusives out there (i'm looking at you, twilight ). first off we have a shot of the entire set with the box. a random page shot, along with pics of the parts list. the build is split up into three sections: the back, the cockpit, and the missles. the back has a lot of nice dark blue plates, and is the only part of the set which uses stickers. the bottoms shows various technic systems, which i'll get to later the cockpit has many details (mostly guns), and the rotating guns are a nice touch. the cockpit can fit a battle droid, but not a minifig. i'm not sure why a droid would want leather though the last part is loading this baby with the missles there are four black(small) and two dark bley (large) missles which are loaded in groups of three as sls. the middle mechanism is for the missiles, and the back part with the bionicle teeth are used ad landing gear the knob on top turns... to release the missiles on the clones ... leftover bits and the used ss(not so d this time around) the gunship versus a time traveling agent charge . overall build: 8/10 a basic build, but at some points repetitive. minifigs: 10/10 just your basic droids, you can't go wrong. design: 7/10 a basic design, with some interesting techniques. pieces: 9/10 a mix of old and new pieces, along with the return of this lovely piece which hasn't been seen for almost 10 years price: 8/10 $30 for a gunship? i'll take it! final verdict: 8/10 a great price for a small set like this, and it has a great bit of swooshability

1 nice review agentrick.$30 is a good price, but tlc think thats 40 so i'll have to pass. btw i thought this ship was supposed to hold many droids like in sw battlefront. oh well, its good for show. edited by skinny boy, 09 august 2008 - 09:31 pm.

0 what? my st came up as the first post....

1 this is a very nice looking set. it could do with a few more clones, but hopefully that will be fixed next year with battle packs. back to the set, i think the colors on this are great (i love dark blue) and the design is pretty good too. it seems to be pretty accurate compared to the real thing. thanks for the review!

-1 i don't really like this set because it isn't my idea of the droid gunship, which is from sw battlefront, which can hold as many droids as a rgs can hold clones. if i buy this, it'd be for the dark blue pieces, which is the signature color of one of my castle nations ( dark red and dark blue ).

0 well, i haven't been keeping up on what was going around in lego starwars,but i think this review would be an average

-1 this is a great set it's too pricey though if it was $10 or so cheaper i'd get it!

1 nice review! crud..i wish i took this gunship instead of the lego indiana jones game.. edited by general magma, 10 january 2009 - 09:58 pm.

1 i'm definitely getting this soon. a good value for money, a cool set, and another part to my clone wars collection!

1 emergency evac set #: 6445 theme: town res-q year released: 1998 piece count: 97 minifigs: 1 list price: $8 (usd) in 1998, lego introduced a new theme called res-q. the theme was really a quasi-coast guard sub-theme of classic town. the theme included boats, helicopters, emergency vehicles, and even a water hovercraft. most notable was the black and yellow color combination that predominated the sets. i only picked up a couple of sets from the theme including this emergency evacuation vehicle that i consider a van. i never got into the theme, but looking back at these sets, i have gained a better appreciation for their value in classic town. let's take a look at 6445 in greater detail. starting with the box: the back of the box providing a few alternate models: and similar imagery on the instructions: the set includes one small sheet of decals for the van: 6445 has one res-q minifig that i find pretty nice. i like the neon orange reflectors: he has a nice printed backside with the word res-q prominently displayed: this little set includes an abundance of tools: a black walkie-talkie is not pictured here's the emergency van: i like the back section that has a nice winch with turning wheel and a few hooks for tools: here's the minifig pulling the grappling hook for some res-q action. this is my favorite part of this set: the van isn't too fancy but has some neat features: while i like the blue windshield piece for maybe space sets, i'm not really fond of its use for the van: the van has no steering wheel, but rather two levers for steering: on the top of the vehicle are two emergency alarms and some extra lights: the back of the van has a large opening piece that allows wide access to the back section: it comfortably fits a long gurney/stretcher: here's the driver resting on the gurney: he should never have tried to pick up the gurney without a 2nd res-q minifig. and a shot of the back section without the gurney: lastly, a picture of the complete set: final thoughts res-q is really a neat theme that has great play value for kids. while it's not one of my more favorite town sub-themes, it does offer some nice pieces and an abundance of black and yellow pieces. i think a few of the res-q sets go nicely with the divers theme released one year earlier in 1997. i had a chance to purchase the largest set of the theme, 6479 emergency response center, at half the price, but passed back in the late 90s. i'd be interested in finding out what other eb members think of this set and the res-q theme.

1 that's it! thanks for the review but now you make me want to build my own one! thanks a lot! on a more serious note, i really like this set and have always wished to aquire it. i have two broken tie interceptors, so this should be a easy build. and as someone in the pirate forum, i think, said, it would be a great baseplate for building cave to hide the booty! thanks pmg and welcome!

0 thanks for the welcome everyone! though i'm still wondering where the drone minion/commander idea came from.

0 set: 7680 - the twilight theme: star wars year released: 2008 piece count: 882 price: $aud149.99 (or $159.99 if you buy at tru!), 99.99 euro, $us99.99 pity the twilight. when rumours of the set name first circulated, speculation was swift: 'twilight - that suggests something sleek, elegant and mysterious.' anticipation mounted! fan-frenzy grew! finally a pic leaked! and the verdict was... 'clunk-a-dunk' it appeared that in the jedi off-season, anakin was running something that looked like an intergalactic garbage scow, like roger wilco in the old sierra space quest pc games. blocky and bley seemed to sum it up. the set went from being one of the most anticipated to one of the least liked of 2008 pretty much instantly. it's a mark of that dislike that in the eb clone wars review feeding frenzy nobody has so far even bothered to post a few pics of this set even 2 weeks after it's official release! i'm here to redress that imbalance now and find out if 7680 is as horrendous as everyone originally thought part 1: box & parts front of the box. it's quite big, same size as the 10144 sandcrawler. annoyingly, it's the old style with the perforated corners that you have to tear to flip open the lid. detail of the back, showing set functions: interior of the box - a lot of wasted space. the set comes with 2 instruction manuals, each 76 pages. and no dss sheet! polybags! 13 of 'em. like the other cw sets, these are unnumbered. parts ahoy! you can tell at a glance that this set is comparable to the at-te, although there a large proportion of the 800+ parts here are technic pins and bley plates. part 2: minifigs and build the set comes with 4 figs (or 3.5, depending on how you look at rotta ): anakin, ahsoka, r2-d2 and rotta. very disappointing that there's nothing new here for such a high-priced exclusive, although i guess it is maybe movie accurate. anyway, to paraphrase the wise patsy stone, you can never have enough hats, shoes or new anakin/ ahsoka hairpieces so it's not too bad. pics of the build in progress. a quarter of the way through we can already see that this is one of those 'convoluted technic frames with some plates affixed' type builds: half-way and the smaller wing is added: at the three quarter mark the giant single wing is added: and voila! done! the final quarter is a race to attach all the exterior surfaces and details such as the engine and escape pod. the build itself is a mixed blessing. it is very technic oriented. i'm not a technic-ally minded person and don't really have much of a conceptual grasp of how everything functions until i see the final result, so i find these type of builds a little uninteresting. pins, axles and beams? give me bricks any day! i really liked the 7676 gunship and the 7679 fighter tank although they do contain some technic framework, they are largely brick-built ships, especially the fighter tank which is solid, largely brick built and full of neat functions. the 7680 build is one of the most technicy builds i've ever undergone in a system set, akin to the experience of building the 10178 motorised at-at. but whereas with that set you could understand the need for a technic framework (the thing walks!) a lot of this seemed excessive. yes, the twilight does some have nice functions, and it is so large and heavy it does need a strong skeleton, but to me it just seemed too much and aesthetics have been sacrificed for (in some cases limited) functionality. i will discuss in more detail what i mean as i look at different parts of the set. on the upside, this is the only non-symmetric set in the cw range, so at least every page and new step brings something different! part 3: a closer view close-up of the main body of the ship: front-on. it is well-designed how the figs appear in line of sight (unlike the 6211 where jabba and leia were photoshopped in to the box art). don't ask what rotta is doing out of the line of vision there. some things are better left unsaid. side view, showing escape pod (smaller cylinder) and drive: top view: rear view, showing back door. the rear deck is huge. indeed, the whole ship is huge. oddly so. i don't know if this is movie-scale or not, but i've seen people complain the fighter tank is too big (!) and that set is nothing compared to this baby! it's wider than the gunship and in wingspan and length is almost bigger. here's a few pics next to an mtt for comparison. pretty big, hey? turning to the dark side must be good for business. even if all you can buy is a rusty old beast like this, at least you could comfortably squash pretty much every vehicle in the opposing fleet just by landing on it. at least now you can see why it costs so much. the official pics make it look smaller, somehow, by truncating the rear and wing. the ship is in fact so big you can't really pose it with wings open - only hold it that way. i was too lazy to build a giant trans-clear support strut so propped it up on a shoebox instead. the wing opens very neatly - you push a technic lever and a pin holding the bottom wing pops out quite smoothly. the little top turret can move up and down as well to get the full cross-shaped effect. part 4: features and functions the front cockpit folds down very neatly, although i find the build here a little weak. whee! it goes all the way down to the floor. the mechanism is cool, but it takes up an awful lot of space. basically the whole front is cockpit and all lego could manage for controls is 2 printed 1x2 tiles as well (not pictured here, but they're attached to the part that folds up and down). there's also no way for anyone to get in or out of the cockpit. and an invisible windscreen! technology has come a long way. side view, looking from wing. r2d2 is here as well as some tools. you can also glimpse here one of the main problems with the set. despite being a huge boxy ship, there's no interior! none! the twilight doesn't even have an internal floor. all the room inside is taken up by the landing gear which folds up - again, a clever function but it really gets in the way of the set as a whole. kudos to the designer for coming up with stable, working landing gear, but too clever by half if it means that this giant ship ends up basically being one tiny cockpit and a rear door at the back that doesn't lead to any interior! underside showing landing gear when open: and closed - when the wing is folded down, the gear is locked in place, which is pretty neat. space-consuming, but neat. the rear section. the door, when opened, reveals an orange cupboard and a tow-line, as ahsoka uses in the box art. the door clicks into place when open and can be released by pressing the technic bit at the top. again, clever, but pointless as you can't get inside! ahsoka can indulge in a little recreational bungee-jumping if she so wishes: the rear deck is so large that it is wasted just being used so ahsoka can bungee-jump. i came up with a much better use for it. outdoor garden! despite having one roboticised hand, anakin was still quite the green thumb. and his light-saber was very useful as a hedge trimmer. so much so that he set up a side business between rotta-rescue missions. here's a promotional postcard: a few other bits and pieces. the gun turret on the enormous mega-wing can only hold one flick fire missile at a time (you do get two, though ) rear engine detail: the escape pod sits neatly on the side and is basically built the same way as the gunship bacta tank: the pod sits on these tehcnic pins and is held in place by the light bley parts: part 5: in conclusion the twilight is a huge ship, with a huge amount of great functions - folding wing, folding cockpit, rear door, escape pod, retractable landing gear! but this functionality comes at a price - a very complex technic build and zip interior. compared with the gunship, for example, which is stuffed with nooks and crannies, the twilight suffers in this respect. i also think it is just too large - it doesn't really fit with the other craft and vehicles released with the clone wars line. i may be wrong and it is movie-accurate, but when you have all the cw sets laid out it does stick out like a poor thumb. part selection is ok, with the only interesting things being a few dark orange plates, the orange cupboard and the big trans-neon green radar dish. don't get me wrong, i don't think this is a bad set at all. it's just the other cw sets are so sweet! i would say it's an above average set in a field crammed with excellent ones. if you're a completist, buy it, but if for example you'd rather invest in another at-te to upgrade your republic army, then i couldn't really disagree with you either and to finish on a light note, i'd like to remind you that you do get another ahsoka hairpiece, which can be used for all sorts of things. ugha warrior upgrade: dr inferno hair transplant: and finally, attack of the deadly blue-ringed octopus, native to australia's beaches and oceans! thanks for reading!

0 another outstanding review by the "awesome set reviewer"! i enjoyed reading this review very much and i felt that you have redress twilight in an approriate manner. i have very mixed feeling about this set especially with its design. it seemed i will need to watch the clone wars movie in the theatre before i compared with it. most of the time, when this lego set is used in a movie, you will tend to compare it and what is the actual purpose for twilight, same as the rest of the sw vehicles and aircraft. for a high price like this, i can actually top up a little more and get the at-te, with the same batch of minifigs plus commander rex. if there is a special figure such as the v19 torrent (clone pliot), it will be a much ideal scenario. at the moment, i have not bring in any clone war sets into my collection, and i am quite sure twilight is not in my priority list especially when i am not a full-pledged star war collectors or i have strong intentions to complete the entire range in this recent release. therefore, i need to prioritise my purchase, and likely to get two rgs, since that is my favourite ship in clone war era. i am not comparing it with rgs. both sets defintely have their pros and cons. oh, i love that postcard you made. certainly looks very nice! svelte_corps, thanks for doing up this superb detailed review which had given "twilight" the neccessary attention it should have.

1 really awesome review svelte_corps . you did a really complete and in-depth review of this beast and with your nice pics is really enjoyable reading your review, so congrats . i like this ship even if it looks so bulky but i need to buy first other sets, so maybe this beast will be landing in my collection the next year (or this one if i am lucky ). i can just ask for something, can you post a pic of all your clone wars sets together with this one (all the sets in one pic, not many pics with this an each set ) please . edited by darkrebellion, 12 august 2008 - 02:20 am.

0 wow certainly much bigger than i would have thought, thanks for the great review and pictures =] well for some reason i was drawn to this set, but with the lack of interior and quite a bit of technics, i think i'll pass, or at least get the at-te first! thanks again!

0 i read the visual guide recently and learned a bit more about the twilight. i won't get into spoilers but it seems that the ship becomes a sort of endearing family van for the characters which is neat. big bulky, uncool, but it gets you from one place to another. if it factors into more than just the 90 minute film, i may pick this up. it seems that there's room for a lot of personality in this ship once you see the film. it is a corellian freighter smuggling spice for the hutts. that's cool right?

1 this is probably the best review i've ever seen. why? it put the set in context with people's changing thoughts about it. it commented on the box, why do such expensive sets have such ordinary boxes? the photography was outstanding. every issue that a builder could have with it was discussed in a calm and rational manner. i have the same issues with technic structured sets, and svelte_corps summed up my feelings on this beautifully. this was an even handed review, so thoughtful. finally, you gotta love a bit of humour in a review, that gardenis brilliant. i was probably never going to get this set anyway but it sets a new world's best standard for reviews. i strongly encourage anyone that's going to review a set to have a good look at this to see how well it can be done. thanks for the magnificent review!

1 oh no! anakin has gone over to the green side of the force! well, i guess someone had to review the clunkadunk eventually. and you did a good job at it, svelte corps! i liked the punchline with the ahsoka-hairpiece swapping. the "ugha warrior upgrade" is an interesting way of creating male togrutas. and ahsoka looks even hotter with inferno's hair! matteo kenobi, on aug 11 2008, 09:30 pm, said: if i am really impressed with it in the film i suppose that would change things, but i will have to see =] i wouldn't count on it. spoiler after its first flight, the twilight will crash and burn! wookieepedia says so, and you can see it in one of the trailers. so, i guess the twilight will stay mostly unbought. poor clunkadunk.

1 thanks a lot for a very nice and entertaining review! your photos were really nice and there have been some reviews lately that have such blurry pics... cough.. cough... it was a pleasure to see you can 1. put lego bricks together 2. write a review 3. handle your camera! i think this ship is underrated, it is really nice! i love the playing features like landing gear and back door, perhaps just cause i had to get along with so called landing gears in the past, that did not work at all (7140 for example..). and i simply love that there is space inside. you said there is not really some cause of the landing gear mechanism, but it seems it should be easily fixed. do you think there is enough space to put some plates over the landing gear and add some beds, kitchen und tv? i think this set is so perfect to mod it into a clone wars mobile home, your back garden ist just perfect for this. i prefer this over the at-te and over a 2nd gunship! thanks a lot for the review!

0 thank you svelte_corps for the review! i like the inside, nice and cosey! i also like your little garden! for me, this put the twilight different in a better perspective than my first perspective of the twilight. i voted outstanding. greets the-force!

0 seems like tlc has done a pretty accurate representation of the ship. the real fault for the ship's messy design has to go to lucasfilm, not tlc. my guess is lucasfilm is trying to recapture that "what a piece of junk!" magic of the millennium falcon. i guess we'll have to wait to see the movie to see if they succeeded or not. the idea of a "space mobile home" reminds me of the winnebago from "spaceballs." great review!! informative, entertaining, and opinionated. so many people shy away from stating an actual opinion in their review for fear of offending anyone. what's the point of making a review if you don't state what you think about it???

0 svelte_corps, on aug 12 2008, 02:19 am, said: hmm... dior. i can smell it now the ship doesn't look too swooshable (but, then again, more than the heavy rgs) i really like that review svelte corps! so much detail! unfortunately i would only get this if it was a very low price, like in a sale.

-1 thanks for yet another awesome review. quote seems like tlc has done a pretty accurate representation of the ship. the real fault for the ship's messy design has to go to lucasfilm, not tlc. my guess is lucasfilm is trying to recapture that "what a piece of junk!" magic of the millennium falcon. i guess we'll have to wait to see the movie to see if they succeeded or not. this sums up my opinion exactly. i can easily admit that the design of the kit is spot on - but unfortunately, the actual design of the ship in the new movie is garbage. actually, despite the millennium falcon's odd design, i really think it's a pretty appealing ship - and its really cool! i can't say the same for the twilight, though.

0 looks fine... but still that designs quite a downer.

-1 dovchenko, on aug 13 2008, 12:29 pm, said: looks fine... but still that designs quite a downer. but look at that wing design! its lovely! looks exactly like the b-29 bombers wings look like.

-1 thanks for the review. i for one will get this set. i collect and therefore i need it. i vision something like this: a: i buy the set b: i built the set c: pics for my bs account d: set taken apart. sad, but true. it's not much, but super for parts. i agree (from what your review showed me) that this set is a little too much technic. a thing that's been invading our beloved brick built sets in the past years. i really have no need for a retractable front or functioning landing gear. what i need is a kick-ass ship with neat design and cool interior. the twilight does not offer that. "look at the size of that thing"

1 good review there! my daughter loves the backyard garden of the twilight my opinion of the ship has changed after reading this, thanks!

1 having plenty of time on my hands this summer i did some reviews. yes, i'm aware this has already been done, but i'll just do it once more. no harm there set# 5615 set title: the knight price: 2.99 euro / 3.49 usd pieces: 21 (yes a whole 21 bricks) release: 2007 the box: a neat little box that has a great size for dropping into your shopping cart. for once tlg didn't shove the bricks into an oversized cardboard box ;) the knight: this is a great minifig. though he looks a little unsatisfied...might be because his head isn't put on "all the way". a great army builder fig. the only thing that i find a little annoying is that the "collar" isn't completely rounded. it looks too much like an animation and left-hand work. the weapon rack: yes! thumbs up for this. plate mail, sword, shield and jousting helmet. plus the spear and open helmet on the fig. so many great additions to put into use. bring it on pesky skeleton army. the all in all verdict: a great set. a little too expensive compared to the crossbow attack in which one gets 2 knights and a skeleton plus bricks for 5.49 euro / 5.99 usd. but still a great army builder set. and the 7090 set, does not have the same knight fig. kimt

1 i bought four of these sets. i guess this was the best selling impulse set so far. great idea to have weapons and helmet choice. as for the price, i'd say 7090 is surprisingly cheap!

1 very good set. indeed the possibility to alter the knight's appearance hugely boosts the value! very smart thinking of tlc. got one of these so far, but if i ever do a castle-related comic or animation, this will be the set i buy tons of.

1 time for another of the great castle sets. and yes this one is a great army builder set as well :d set# 7090 set title: crossbow attack price: 5.29 euro / 5.99 usd pieces: 54 release: 2007 the box: and as the other two sets reviewd so far (7009 and 5615), this one has a fitting box that is too easily snatched from the shelf and put into your shopping cart. - not sure it's a great thing...too expensive in the end :d the crossbow attack cart: the cart is a neat little build that actually works. and for once we're not given that awful technic launcher, but a "build-it" launcher! it actually works just fine for it's purpose. the addition of two crossbows makes it worth buying. never can get enought weapons for the evergrowing crownie army. the figs: oddly i've not taken any pics of the figs and therefore i'll illustrate using the s@h pic. the figs are great. i love the silver helmets and in this set you get 2 crownies and a skeleton plus a white skeleton horse. that's a lot of figs for a set this size. a true army builder. thumbs up for that. the all in all verdict: another small, yet super set in the castle theme. i bought several of these to make a fine little army. it's cheap and often found on sale! i can hardly resist buying it when i see it kimt

1 hard to find (in italian shops); i had a friend buying one for meas soon as the set was available. i always wanted another one, so while in switzerland (see kimt's 7009 review for the full story), i bought two. for 5 uros you get two knights, a skeleton and a skeleton horse, some hand weapons and a shooting device (please remember, don't aim at the eyes!) just great.

1 and another set enters the scene: set# 7009 set title: the final joust price: 8.29 euro / 7.99 usd pieces: 62 release: 2007 the box: and yet again tlg has put the bricks in a box, that somehow corresponds with the amount of bricks in it. the castle theme has got well designed boxes :) the whole set (build): 2 knights, jousting fence and weapon rack. the weapons rack: another great addition of weapons. flail, halberd and skeleton scimitar. super weapons for those close encounter melee battles fought when tipped off the horse : :grin:p the jousting fence: not much to say. it's a fence. simple, yet it serves it's purpose very well. the crown knight: gotta love that guy. he looks like nothing can hurt him. he even got a selfsufficient smile on his face. i'm sure he's convinced that no skeleton can defeat him. also the horse, it's barding and the headcover looks awesome. a great old school sword and the ever cool normannic shield. what could possibly go wrong for this knight? the helmet i really love. imo it's a lot better than the old knight helmets (see review of 5615 the knight for a pic of one of those). the skeleton knight: the black skeleton horse rocks! i love that design and in black it's even badder than than the white version. the shield reeks of dread and the knight is one bad skeleton on the rampage. i do find that the helmet is a little off! i'd rather have a black knights helmet instead. the kk helmet doesn't really do it for me. the all in all verdict: this is another great army builder set. it holds a lot of great weapons, some cool minifigs and great pieces. the only thing that puzzles me is; why would a crown knight joust a skeleton? doesn't really make sense. kimt

1 lovely set. nice collection of weapons. cool horse-accesoires for the white knight, cool black skeletal horse on the dark knight's side. loving the printed armours of both knights! and, as opposed to kimt apparently, i really dig the black helmet. i feel there's a lord of the rings-flavour to it with those curves. well designed!

1 another small set my local target doesn't have. they don't have the best castle selection, they only really have dwarven mines and castle seiges. i'll buy this if i see it there though, because it looks like a great little set. i could use the awesome knight, and a skeleton that has a regular body so he looks like he is in armor!!!!!

0 i'm not a huge fan of this set but it is a great way to nab a fully mounted knight complete with a very attractive barding. given that in prior years it wasn't possible to get a barded horse in such a small set, this set is actually a decent way to build a mounted cavalry for your kingdom. looking at bricklink, it would probably cost as much to buy the knight, horse and weapons separately, and that doesn't take into account the skeleton or the extra bricks. despite my indifference to this set, i actually have purchased four of them in the past year simply because there isn't a cheaper way to acquire a mounted knight.

1 you know what i think this set has? charm. lots of it. i'm not a big fan of castle, having very few sets, all of them spanning different nations/armies, but i couldn't resist this set. and while not obvious at first, it really is backwards compatible with every castle set with a horse in it. nonetheless, i think this set is great. it's simple, cheap and has charm. that's good enough for me. plus it has that fantastic grinning knight and the black skeleton horse. those just made it better.

0 tenorikuma, on aug 13 2008, 03:48 am, said: i should really get one more of these for the figures, shields, and weapons. this set is the only one with the scythe in pearl-grey, by the way. except, it's just plain dark-grey, you must have gotten this set mixed with another. though i've never heard of a pearl-grey scythe

1 good review kimt. pictures are clear and show each of the pieces in great detail. i agree with your comments as well. i'm a bit curious, does the knight's helm have a hole for plume? i've been debating whether to purchase this set or not. i'm not a big fan of horses so i'll likely barely use them, but i do like the unique minifigs, weapon rack/weapons, and the fact that the divider has a few useful pieces that can be added to other sets. however, i just don't feel the set is worth $8 when compared to crossbow attack and the knight's catapult unless the buyer is really wanting some mounted minifigs. luckily, amazon just lowered their price of this set from $8 to $6 (along with another 20% if using bill me later... just in case anyone was also in the same situation i was in). at that price, it's damn well worth it.

1 indexed name: holiday villa theme: lego system / town year: 1988 pieces: 197 minifigs: 2 price: usd ? there were quite a few sets in the 1980's that weren't sold in the us. i remember reading once that it was because they contained wine glasses and tlg felt they wouldn't be able to market a toy that encourage the drinking of alcohol. this set was one of them. i remember seeing this in a catalog that came with a fabuland set and wondering what it was and where i could get one. i wrote to lego and got an overseas catalog which had the futuron 6990 monorail transport system in it before it was available in the us. i was amazed. i ended up buying 6349 holiday villa from that catalog but, for some reason, gave it to my best friend for his birthday. i've always wanted this set and finally bought it from bricklink this year.... my purchase included everything except the box. i really like the boxes. but, in lieu of a boxshot, here is the instruction manual: i imagine this was the image on the front of the box: the parts one of the things that appealed to me about this set is it's abundance of rare parts. this base plate is an excellent piece and was only available in two sets: classic lego telephone: technically, these blue windows 1 x 4 x 5 windows are only available in this set, according to bricklink. it was available in different form (with and without fixed glass, trans blue glass) in other sets. regardless this size and color window is rare and the blue door was only available in 4 sets. this was a huge selling point for me as i'm a window monkey. never heard that term? it's like a parts monkey (a collector who buys mulitples of sets just for parts or large lots of bulk from bl and sorts them into bins) but just for windows. tell your friends i coined the term: these sloped windows have endless possibilities in many themes (maybe not with the curtain decals applied) but are another great rare part that appears in this set: the build remember this piece? i'd like to see a badass agents car built on this car base! : i am a fan of the six-wide car but i see the appeal of the four wide. it has a very nostalgic feel to it: there's no denying that this is a beauty of classic lego 4-wide cars: this set comes with two mini-figures, one of which appears to be a painter. classic vintage lego figs: onto the house which begins with the basic floorplan: a kitchen that's open to the rest of the house and a little oven and hood vent is one of my favorite touches. it's one thing to throw an oven into a house set, but the designer of this set made it a cool part of the architecture of the house which gives it a unique feel: the completed first floor and carport: i do wish the sides of the roof were white with a little overhang like an actual roof. this method of white on bottom, red on top looks more like a child's drawing than a real house. this is easily fixed with some modifying. still, you get a lot of roof pieces in this set: here we have the completed set. the husband cleans the yard while the wife gets plastered on wine. don't tell the american kids! another angle: working in the kitchen: getting smashed before dinner. i think she may have a serious problem: the bedroom. a little stark, but the bed looks comfy: overall shot of the interior: rating playability: 9/10 (the possibilities are endless with drunky mcwine-wine and husband. really, playability is up to the imagination of the player. it's a house, not really very action-packed.) design: 9.5/10 (great design with plenty of rare parts. love the classic car, too! loses half a point for the all red roof...) price: na (i believe this was inexpensive, but since i have no proof, i will have to leave this factor out of the overall rating.) overall: 9.25/10 (classic sets like this all deserve 10s in my book, but looking at it with an objective eye it's excellent, but not perfect.)

1 this looks like a really great set! i wasn't around in '88 to get it but i like it! it actually has things inside the interior! thanks for the review. hinckley, on aug 13 2008, 06:11 pm, said: there were quite a few sets in the 1980's that weren't sold in the us. hooray!

1 that's a great review of a great set, hinckley! i voted for outstanding : this set is simply amazing! i regrettably don't own this set since it's very hard to find on ebay and/or the stickers are missing. but nevertheless i hope that i one day will be able to get this awesome set - or even better - see tlg releasing a new city villa in a style similar to that brilliant set . klaus-dieter edited by klaus-dieter, 13 august 2008 - 06:30 pm.

1 nice set what a great find, this is one thing i think the tlg has forgotten about, the creator houses are nice but they are not really geared toward a town them (no mini figs, cars etc) these sets were and that adds so much to a town layout it can't be overlooked. i really like this i may have to start my ebay searching..... thanks hinckley

0 great review! i'd give this set an 8 at the least. it's just a tad too simple for my liking but other than that it looks great! while i'm a 4 wide car man i actually think this car looks rather horrendous. the main body seems way too low in comparison with the windows. the rare parts however do make up for it. hinckley, on aug 13 2008, 11:23 pm, said: yes yes. in the states, horrifying and deplorable violence is fine, but drinking and swearing sends kids directly to hell. somehow, i feel like watching south park now ... that was such a good episode

-1 it's a nice house but perhaps a little sparsh on detail. just a few more pieces for additional furniture would have been nice. like the car though.

0 cool review! i never knew that those wine-glasses could be the reason for this not being sold in the us!

1 i wish i could find this set some day (including the right baseplate). some of my house mocs are styled after the classic 6349. and sometimes i've rebuilt it after instruction scans exchanging the baseplate (i don't own one of these) with 2 at 16x32 each. and this city house out of an older thread of mine. it's offensive, that i've used styling elements of 6349's just enlarged. in terms of interior details: not much, but still enough for classic town. i voted outstanding mfg widdi edited by widdi, 09 october 2008 - 01:22 am.

1 has anyone noticed the dwarf in one of the completed shots? nice set, alot better than the new city sets...*looks at an army of firefighters that have no fires to put out and the police officer army* edited by indianajones, 21 april 2010 - 12:06 pm.

1 this would be great for any pirate fan, the extraback pack for the soldiers, some spare owes for the row boats, a female face for a wench, and a rather simple raft for that unlucky pirate lost at sea! over all a nice set, i am a little confused by the dynamite though... perhaps an easy way to go fishing or perhaps to clear a rock in the forseen future? or is it that she is just a suicide bomber attacking the white house water (joke not ment to be tasteless or offensive to those lost in the act of terrosim, greatest respect to those who have lost loved ones) great review, regards cpt. pb

1 overall, an excellent set concerning the price range. nice review, whitefang!

1 good set, i laughed at the dynamite, but not as much as that axe... not many trees on the rapids. looks like she's got more than dynamite to cause havoc in the harbour...

1 glad some of you like this set for the wide variety of good accessories. it seemed some are unfavour of the raft's design. well, i think for an impulse set. the raft's design is quite good. at least, it took care of the color scheme well. it's just a simple raft for the adventurer to move onto the river stream and throw some dynamitte to blow some obstacles away. cpt. pegleg blockbeard, on aug 14 2008, 03:29 pm, said: this would be great for any pirate fan, the extraback pack for the soldiers, some spare owes for the row boats, a female face for a wench, and a rather simple raft for that unlucky pirate lost at sea! your comments make me feel like i has just done a pirate review instead of an extreme team review.

0 metalandi, on aug 15 2008, 07:16 am, said: do you have any other res-q sets left to review? it would be an honour for me to also do a review of one or more sets which are left thanks metalandi. this and the emergency evac set are the only re-q sets i have. i would encourage you to share a review as you have done some very nice reviews.

0 cool, then i think i'll do a review of 6451 river response later today or tomorrow, stay tuned!

1 i got this set as well as a res-q hovercraft. this set is cool because of all the accessories and it come with a x team guy. your set is also in much better condition than mine. you have made me decide to rebuild it. another great review thebrickster. keep up the good work.

1 looks like a nice helicoptor, i love the 2 cockpits. i love the diver's head, i really need one of those.

0 thanks for the review brickster, i do own this set in it's original form, the only drawback that i have noted previously is the lack of rotor's and the cobraesq of the copter body i wish it had a larger fuselage but i still have it and i still like it despite my criticism....which i am sure is in my eyes only. thanks again brickster. i wish i had bought some of the other res q sets but of course i only bought three.

1 i've always wanted this set and the hovercraft... too bad i never did. great set.

-1 i stopped collecting lego sets in the early 90s because of this kind of sets. i've always been a classic town fan and i really didn't liked the futuristic design of tlc's newer sets.

1 what exactly makes you feel this set isn't realistic? it has got nothing what wouldn't be on a real helicopter, imo. and for the futuristic design, yes, it looks modern, but it works. and actually, most of today's real helicopters also don't look like in the 70's anymore.

0 metalandi, on aug 24 2008, 04:17 pm, said: what exactly makes you feel this set isn't realistic? since the question was asked... 1) tiny rotors 2) dual cockpits (only seen on a few military copters) 3) stretcher extends beyone edges of fuselage when inside the vehicle 4) extra long canopy (really only seen on military helicopters), and "military" design. 5) black colorscheme for rescue vehicle. the the stretcher, minifig designs and rescue logo are the only things about this copter that really suggest that it is a civilian rescue aircraft. it's a toy set with alot of play value, but i agree with karto that these kind of desgins really turned me off to alot of the town and city sets of the 90's. on the positive side, the new city sets, with thier realistic non-futuristic designs have really tempted me to buy more vehicles.

1 it took quite some time, but now i'm finally continuing with city reviews. this one beeing about a really good set of the res-q theme, and also one of my favourites of this theme. it brings a lot of playability and an incredible amount of useful pieces, even with only 145 bricks in complete. set nr.: 6451 name: river response number of minifigs: 3 number of pieces: 145 release year: 1998 price: ~20 usd (back then, when it was new) unfortunately i haven't got the box of this set anymore, but the instructions are still there in good condition: we get 3 res-q minifigs in this set, from which i really love the detailed torso's: a shot of the complete set with both the boat and the little car off board: the before mentioned car is really, really little, but it still got enough space to transport 2 minifigs: a closeup of the rubber dinghy: the speed boat as stand-alone: as already said before, this set brings a big count of equipment and accesoires with it, which is really good for a set this size: in the middle section of the boat there is enough space for a minifig to sit in and put on his diving equipment: and last but not least, a shot from the whole set wirh everything attached, at the front section you can see a wench which also adds a lot to the set: when i got this set back in the day, i was really happy about it and for sure spent a lot of tie playing with it, because of it's great features as the wench in the front of the boat, or the car the boat can transport. i hope you like my little review, stay tuned for more in the next days! edit: i forgot the poll, can sombody add it please? i don't know how to do or if it is possible to do that myself edited by metalandi, 15 august 2008 - 03:59 pm.

1 this set was my first set ever from the resq series, and i loved it entirely! ofcourse i modded it slightly here and there after hours and hours of fun and excitement, it has great play value, even for a set in this size

1 this is one of my favourite sets. i remember getting it in tesco soon after it was released. those were the days... the res-q line was good, and this set made it better.

1 wow. i loved this set, i still have it actually... in pieces though, i took it apart quite soon after i got it, then managed to lose the instruction manual

1 if you still have all the parts, try to rebuild it, you'll see that it's a great feeling!

0 very nice review. this is another set which i had never seen before when i am in my dark age. quite an useful set, especially with the accessories and the minifigs' torsos. the speedboat is able to hold the car and the rubber rescue boat. how can the driver steer this boat with so many things blocking the way? i can't seemed to find its control though. thanks for doing this review.

0 nice review. i always wanted this set. the speed boat makes the set. thanks for sharing.

1 6004 crossbow cart review because i may start collecting castle here is a review of one of my few castle sets. please note i hurriedly put his together meaning some parts are the wrong color, look out for them! this review will also be done in my star wars review style. the lighting is also particularly bad in the pics. on with the review... parts: 20 figs: 1 price: ????? 1.overview and fig the whole set. the fright knight's knight. the disemboweled knight. the head printing is just longer then the helmet visor. 2. the cart the cart has 3 crossbows and 2 norman type shields. the cart's advanced defense and weapons systems. all the parts from the cart. (forgot to add the fig in) 3.extras & overall here are all my castle figs. remember i don't collect castle. (yet ) oh yeah i forgot to put one of the old skellies and a ghost on there. could a castle fan tell me if any of these minifigs are rare. i have no idea because i don't collect castle. build: 6/10 pretty standard for a impulse. minifigs: 7/10 nice minifig with lots of accessories. design: 8/10 this set made way for some of the new castle carts of similar size. parts: 10/10 3 crossbows, 2 shields, arrow quiver, and spear as well as cool minifg in a 20 piece set! price: 10/10 well i don't know but lego was cheaper in '97 so it gets 10. playability: 5/5 pretty much standard for a impulse set. overall 8/10 good parts and price as well as minifig scores this set an 8. thanks for reading.

0 nice review i collect castle too and the ghost isn't really rare (i have one too) but it's not really found anymore so it would be a good thing to keep it. anyway great review edited by mammymarf, 15 august 2008 - 08:48 pm.

0 about the rarest one up there is that black ninja. i only have one ninja and he is dark grey. i also have five samurai. the witch may be fairly rare but i am not sure. i didn't really collect much in the fright knight era.

0 quote even though many people dont like frightknights. i don't really like fright knights either i just happened to have this set.

0 thanks for the review. i've added it to the index. i'm not a fan of this theme. but i have to say that this is a neat little set, that does hold some good things. figs and weapons are always welcome and one can never have to many wheels. so i rate this "average."

1 this is a pretty nice set. i really like the torso and its "genericness" so it can be used for other factions. and at least this set has 2 shields (althought i prefer the triangular ones) instead of just 1 shield you get from crossbow attack (from the wrong fraction, i'd have liked a crown knights shield 100x better). some improvements for this set would be a normal bow and a sword instead of 2 of the 3 crossbows, smaller wheels and triangular shields. 4/5 from me (actually 3,5 but i'll round it up)

1 originally shared in the history & adventure forum for its adventure attributes, here's my favorite of the outback collection: first, let me say that this little set is one of my all-time favorites because it can be used to sumplement a number of different themes. 1) the set makes a great little adventure airstrip for adventurers and more recent, the indiana jones theme (see also german headquarters and port adventure). i've also used the set as an addition to my wild west town. the tan baseplate and windmill works great, just subtract the plane, modern equipment, and figs. and lastly, as the set was intended, as an outback/desert airstrip. set description: outback airstrip set # 6444 pieces: 157 minifigs: 3 release date: 1997 original price: $20 (usd) starting with the box: and the backside. notice the alternate models. i love the swamp boat: the building is my favorite part of the set. it is simple, has a little detail, two great roof pieces, and a single green window (great piece!): check out the great windmill piece. it's my only one and makes a great part for wild west and that farm you always wanted to build. i used it for the barnhouse of barnabas higgens and spring valley ranch on the side of the building is a great radio and a clear glass: unfortunately, no furniture can be found within the building: and now the airplane: front view; i love the twin propellors: side view: and the rear section: the back has a small cargo hold for some boxes/freight or some gear needed in the outback: the set includes three figs, two with cool shades: and some great equipment. i love the boom box: a shot of the whole set: and another: summary: as i mentioned above, this set is very versatile and can suplement a few different themes. it's my personal favorite of the outback collection and i'm really glad i was able to find the set in the late 90s (i almost didn't buy). sets like this are timeless and so much fun to build and display. hope you enjoy the review. edit: additional reviews: review by agentrick57 (december 24, 2007) outback airstrip review in history & adventure forum (february 10, 2008)

1 great review! this set has cool features. i just wish that lego would release this as a lego legend and release it to australia too, since this is a set about australia. i would've bought two if this were a lego legend. that is how good it is. i like the building with latticed window and windmill. i also like the cargo airplane, windsock, and radios. plus it looks like it's got great minifigs.

1 this is probably my all-time favorite lego set. it was originally given to me for my birthday by a close friend of mine back in the release year of 1997. the cargo plane was, by far, my favorite vehicle ever. unfortunately, someone stole the plane from me when our families went on vacation and the rest of the set was given to my cousin's oldest son when i was no longer interested in my lego collection. now that i'm back into lego, i use that building's construction for various projects, especially as a dr. inferno look-out shack using parts from extra mission 3: swamp raid. the shack compliments the original set greatly. edited by skorpius47, 19 august 2008 - 01:44 am.

1 the building is great and detailed, with a few mods it could be added to my castle town. i don't really like the plane though, seems kind of abstract, not really good in my opinion, but i bet it would be easy to mod to look better.

1 one of the best in my humble opinion. as far as i know it was never released in the uk so the only reason i managed to get my hands on it was on a family holiday to the us, i think theyd only recently opened the lego store in disney. arguable the best feature is that it seems to fit into a wide selection of themes, is it a airstrip in the middle of nowhere, is it next to a only mining town thats not deserted the possibilities are rather open and thats truly great.

1 set#: 7103 theme: star wars set name: jedi duel pieces: 74 release: 2002 price: 10 usd minifigs: 2 (count dooku and yoda) links: 7103 brickshelf folder bricklink reference catalog peeron.com introcomment: i remember getting this set solely because i collect star wars. as i rebuild it and took pics of it, i found that i actually like this set for different reasons. dooku's speeder is pretty cool and the lightsabre rocks. the dooku minifig is also great. what's not so great is the flythingy and getting another yoda. though that's kinda hard not to get in a set focused on their duel "you can't see the wires, because they digitally removed them." "be careful or i'll digidally remove your head" - steven seagal [i hope i quoted that one right ] so to get the review on the move, i'll impress you all with a box picture: neat, huh? one of the smaller boxes, but still kinda big when consider that you only get 74 pieces and 2 minifigs. the instruction isn't that big as i said, the dooku minifigs is awesome i love the print on his torso that combines the brown cape with the torso and also the head is neatly designed. not a fleshie, though. this was before the flesh-license-facelift a sideview of the light blue speeder. mmmm that crome light sabre hilt is nice the design of the speeder is also ok, and without the usual off-colour-scheme bricks. no tan or yellow sticking out there yeah, i'd panic too if this came right at me...who wouldn't when noone's driving? and a rear shot. i think the design is a little off. the shields makes it all a little too open in my opinion. the printed bricks are a kick and thus evens the score here. this hideous design is meant to flip yoda around the air. put him in this funfair from hell thing and give him a twister he and dooku will never forget. my guess is that it's there to add some playability, but it's just odd and quite useless. much like the playability soccer thingies in the ultimate light sabre duel the verdict: ups and downs. this set offers both. i rate it as "average" since the size and price of the set make it acceptable to have odd things. confused? good so am i making a small set isn't that easy and remeber this set is from 2002 and a lot has happended since then, designwise that is. what do you think?

0 whats wrong with another yoda and some nice light blue bricks? i probably would destroy this set, and keep the minifigs intack tough, chrome lightsabers on!

-1 thanks for the review kimt! oldies reviews(old sets ) are always appreciated. i feel this set isn't that great. 1- yoda: he is by far the best part of the set. although, is his weapon blue? 2-lord tyrannus: pretty nice! i feel the middle part of his torso is a bit bland, but that isn't a problem. i wish they would make a fleshie one too. 3- speeder bike: i always hated this design. the back looks terrible to me. way too bulky in my opinion. it jusn't give me the image that it's the same as the movie. the lightsaber is amazing! why is it only in this set? 4-yoda-lifter: what? that is terrible. but at least it has some nicely colored parts.... a fine set, but not the best imo.

1 you think it's not a great thing that we get a yoda fig in an affordable set like this?!? that was the main reason why i got this set! and what do you mean by "another"? wasn't this the only one that was ever released except for the one in the dagobah/x-wing set? sure, he is not the best fig with the unmovable legs and all, but still: it's yoda! besides, he doesn't move his legs a lot in "real" life either. nice review, though, and thanks for telling me what that liftarm-thingy was meant to be for. i never got that and thought it was supposed to lift up the speeder for some reason. i got two of this set, and the printing on those blue parts were off in the second one i got. edited by oky wan kenobi, 18 august 2008 - 08:45 pm.

0 no, yoda was released in no less than 3(4) sets. ok, so i remembered wrong. i just have plenty yodas and one is more than enough for the set list click here thanks for pointing that out.

0 i missed out on this set but it looks pretty good imo. thanks for clearing up what that thing was i thought it was something they flung at eachother in the movie i like the lightsaber also but why did they stop making chrome ones

0 i wonder how expensive this set would be on ebay. (shop victoriously)

1 i missed this set.but i reallly like the yoda and count dooku.i especially like count dooku's lightsaber.one thing though,is it me oris yoda's lightsaber blue in the picture? edited by pr0visorak, 20 august 2008 - 12:21 pm.

1 i was very lucky to get this set and i love it, i dont have it built cause i bought it for parts but it was fun while it lasted. .

0 i got this set a long time ago. the review pretty much says all there is to say about it. (never knew what the red/brown thing was anyway, i used it as a canon.) isn't this also the only set up until now that had count dooku in it?

1 great review, kimt! at that time, it was still in my dark age and i hated myself not to get this set earlier. this is quite inexpensive and you are able to get two greatest characters especially count dooku. the minifigs are excellent, especially the unique design of count dooku's lightsaber. i have no problem with the speedbike, as it looks quite alright to me. as for the elevation of yoda's jump adds some playabilty, but that does not work well for me. nevertheless, the main attractive factor is count dooku and i have to rate it a "5". i never own a yoda, except for the magnet version.

1 thanks for the review. it's always good to have a 2nd opinion on a set. i've added the usual poll and i'll index it tomorrow (must sleep). super pics and great to have "in-build" pics a fine set which i'll surely buy when i find it.

1 very nice review. one thing you have to consider: when lego sees pics of the star wars universe, they have to decide which would be the easiest set to make with the most playibility. therefore, they chose the hmp. quote thanks for the review. it's always good to have a 2nd opinion on a set. i've added the usual poll and i'll index it tomorrow (must sleep). super pics and great to have "in-build" pics default_thumbup.gif a fine set which i'll surely buy when i find it. default_hmpfbad.gif where? edited by lt. col. thok, 18 august 2008 - 10:07 pm.

1 ~vbbn~, on aug 18 2008, 05:54 pm, said: final rating: 86% how'd you figure that? but seriously, this looks like a great set, and am planning on making it my next lego purchase. how did you ge tis for $25? i almost bought it the other day, the box makes it look so cool. something about the new clone wars packaging makes you want to buy all the sets on the shelf! thanks for the review, darthperson edited by darthperson, 18 august 2008 - 11:09 pm.

1 thanks for the review. i have had second thoughts about purchasing this bad boy and i think you made it clear that it was a nice buy. however, i would have loved the maf too!

1 niuce review! i voted above average, it's very cool but not awesome.

0 and it's now a part of the index. i've added it as "review 2" since we've already got one. thanks for the review and it's always nice to have nmore than one view/opinion on a given set

1 cloneme, on aug 28 2008, 05:11 am, said: i don't know what it is about this set but i love it. i can't get enough of it. it looks amazing. nice review. you've said it all that's exactly how i feel about it. i've not got a single clue as to what this thing is or why. but the colours and the design are awesome. might be a little small....anyways i'm getting it.

1 it took a long time, but now here it is, the review of the x-treme team set 6584 extreme team challenge. thebrickster asked me a few weeks ago to do this, since he unfortunately never owned this great set, so here we go! first i have to say, that i really love this late 90's town theme, and i wish there would have been produced more sets. this is the only one i own, well, beside that i also still have 6572 wind runners, but the car is missing. anyway, let's face the facts and let the pictures speak for themselves! sub-theme: x-treme team set nr.: 6584 name: extreme team challenge number of minifigs: 4 number of pieces: 354 release year: 1998 let's start off with a few quick shots of the box & instructions: inside of the box: we got some ideas for alternative models on the backside (the same ones are also on the backside of the instructions): instructions: here's an overall view of this huge set: we get 4 minifigs, each with different heads and color patterns, which i really like: ...and also a good amount of equipment for them: let's move on with the cool vehicles, there are 3 (!) completely different ones in this set, first is the neat little trike: next, the not less neat "4-wheeled off-road-thing" (don't know what's it called really ): and finally the huge monster truck, i love the chrome sidepipes and the wench with the hook in the back, which adds a lot of playability: oh, i almost forgot our brave adventurers also have got a raft to ride the wild mountain waters: now let's focus on the many details of the mountain base. we got a bridge over troubled waters, but be aware, it's very unstable! love the wood patterns on the yellow 1x6 tiles: on a corner a camera is mounted to document the wild life: for the evenings we also got a little campfire: down by the river sits a grey falcon and watches the guys on their challenges: what's that? seems not very safe, to be honest..be aware when you pass by these rocks.... ....cause it will collapse! let's move up again where the tent is placed, inside is plenty of space to take a rest for the figs and to store their equipment: but i think they should have built the tent on another place cause the ground isn't very good there: when you pull the mechanism, a trap door opens: will the guys all come back home safe and not injured? you decide! all in all this is a really great set, ome may say it is a bit juniorized because of the baseplate, but it really isn't. it's got a lot of playability and some rare parts, the biggest beeing the baseplate which is only available in this set. i hope you liked my review, let me know your opinions! edited by metalandi, 23 august 2008 - 12:56 pm.

1 excellent review metalandi! i really think this looks like a fun set. i esp. love the mountain, bridge, and baseplate. it has adventure fun written all over it. thanks for taking the time to review this set. i've always seen it in pictures, but never close-up.

1 metalandi, thanks for doing up this review! this is a chance for me to gain some insight for extreme team theme. this is a very interesting set that can be used for so many purposes. 3 different vehicles, wide range of accessories and nice minifigs. what i love the most, is the mountain, bridge and tent. it provided so much playability. i am very impressed with it. thanks for sharing.

1 cool set! i like the tent and monster truck the most.

0 set data 4920: the rapid rider year: 1999 subtheme: rock raiders pieces: 37 (+1 extra - trneongreen plate 1 x 1 round) price: euro 3,50, used, not including s/h, on ebay building time: less than 10 minutes. more info: bricklink - peeron. i could have owned the 4910 hover scout (see metalandi's review here), but while i was buying some used sets, i forgot to buy that one too! so, here's my only rr set, the second smallest one (if we don't count japanese promos; sweets are surely sweeter if they come with a lego set!) pieces: face and torso closeup; i like the torso, the face is good except for the bandanna. building is based on two big pieces: landing skids and plate 6 x 6 x 2/3 cross with dome. let's go! building is over: review: pros: small set (= cheap), 1 fig, two accessories, some interesting pieces like the rock and the crystal. no stickers but 3 printed pieces! good color choice. cons: tipper bucket is fixed, no hinge. no levers or steering wheel, it probably moves by using the buttons on the 2x2 tile. it deserves a 4/5.

1 this was the first rock raiders set i got. i really like it, and i think i got all of them except the huge cargo airlift thing. i remember these sets coming out and getting the big base for christmas, though they are all destroyed now... sadly... . nice review.

0 when i first saw this review title, i thought it said "rapid river review" thinking it was an indian set (6766). nice review though. i never got into rock raiders. i would have loved the large drill bit piece for set #s 4970 and 4940. this set looks like a little boulder hawler, and a nice set to introduce someone unfamilar with the theme. i esp. like the fig and the little 2x2 drill bit tile. the overall set looks like it has some very useful mining-type pieces. nice review and thanks for sharing.

1 i have never seen this set before but the minifig head would be perfect for a solid snake from mgs 2!

1 rock raiders was the shit back in the day. awesome theme! i had this set as well as the tunnel transporter, which was amazing.

0 thanks for the review! rock raiders was one of the last new themes i knew as a kid before my dark ages came. unfortunately i never managed to get any sets from it, beside a few months ago the 4910 the hover scout, which i review a while ago. wish i can get some of the bigger sets in the future.

1 i always thought that this set was under-rated. it contains a really interesting collection of parts, a decent fig, and introduces an odd theme in only one set. very well designed for one of the 'not greats'. god bless, nathan

1 hello all eurobricks members and classic town lovers, *** editor's note: to mark the celebration of classic town, this set which is released in 1994 and re-released as a legend in 2002. pizza to go review, is dedicated to classic town's opening cermony and members such as hinckley, brickster, imperialshadows, sinner and many others whom have contributed to the final success of classic town! thank you so much for inviting me to be part of this wonderful project, and i wish all the best to the success of classic town! i urge everyone of you to check out classic town and take alook at the cool stuff we have done! *** today, i will be doing up a review on pizza to go set. this outlet is one of the most favourite eatery for any lego citizens living in their town. when they are driving on the road, they are sure to look out "pizzeria" signage. they offer the best pizza in town. no one in town can resist the delicious aroma of pizza, coming out from the red chimney. let us find out why is this shop so popular among so many lego citizens and was one of the famous sets that is re-released under the "legend" theme. pizza to go is my favourite set of all time. i believed there is no other pizza outlet lying around in any lego city apart pizzeria. it seemed there are the sole outlet that is selling pizza for many years. this set was re-released in 2002 and it is part of the legend theme. this is one of the few sets that are highly demanded to be brought back by many fans of lego around the world. i owned the 6350. any members whom had owned both sets before? is there any difference between these two? because when i searched through peeron, it shown 144 pieces instead of 194 pieces for the 1994 set. name: pizza to go theme: lego system / town year: 1994 (re-release: 2002) pieces: 194 minifigs: 3 an image of a 6350, pizza to go let the delivery begins! pizza to go is the regular pizza outlet that sells nothing but pizza. they deliever pizza to every household in town, with their trusty delivery van. walk-in are welcomed too. there is a stand for customers to dine in their pizza quickly before making their way to their next destination. in my opnon, no town can ever survive without the pizza tradition! devoted "pizzeria" staff every outlet comes with 3 dedicated staff, making sure that operations will run smoothly. on the left, we will have the pizza boy, whom is wearing the regular blue dungarees and its white cap. i wonder who is that boy? on the middle, we will have the pizza girl. she looks like any typical sweet girl in town that the boys will look at. she is wearing a suntop strapless on her. she reminded me of one person though, i think her name is called alice. taking a careful look, i wonder if imperialshadows is the pizza boy back then, without that black patch on its left eye? on another note, this mini-figure was my favourite. female mini-figures are very uncommon back then. i am glad i have this figure, adding to my town population. on the right, we will have the hardworking chef, preparing the pizzas in the oven. he wears the regular white chef outfit, but he wear a grey pants instead of the usual full-white outfit in most resturants such as breezeway cafe (6376). let's take a closer look at the pizza boy's van! this van is very very small looking and very fuel efficient. it is able to cut lanes very fast due to its small size. the pizza van is made up of 4-studs wide design. no doors by the side. however, in this vehicle, i think the doors is not a must to be included in this design. our pizza boy will need to leave vehicle pretty fast, and ensuring that the pizza delivery is on time. common mechanism this van has the regular rooftop that can be lifted up to place the pizza boy into the driver seat. there is a sun roof on its top, which enable him to let him have some sunlight from above! the logo on the side of it, is actually a transparent sticker, which have the pizzeria itallian logo and a tasty looking pizza on both sides of its van. i like that sticker very much. mine looks quite worn out over time. if its a printed piece, it will be a terrific bonus. nevertheless, i can still accept the sticker. our pizza van can deliever up to 2 pizza at a go! at every trip, 2 piping hot pizza will be stored at the back of the van. the pizza is fitted in perfectly in each compartment. furthermore, the white window shutter, is terrific in this design. you don't see this kind of design anymore. i think, i have not seen much delivery vans on the street anymore too. base of the van from the base, you can see that it is using of the regular red car base that is common in most 4-studs vehicle design. in fact, this car base served as a foundation for its vehicle design. back of pizzeria alice and the chef will be showing you around at the back of the kitchen. there is an oven on the left, a water tap and a holder for the oar stick. looks pretty empty right? look below for a surprise! my favourite feature! this oven can be used to heat up 2 pizzas at a go. now, i understand why, this set is named "pizza to go". i have been using their slogan unknowingly. this feature is superb nice. now, we know that the pizza is prepared from the outlet instead of using delivery van to collect it from a factory. alice, what are you waiting for? help the chef quickly! pizzeria! the signage sure looks big from far and catches their attention easily too with its pleasnt looking design. as you have already noticed, this is made up of sticker. i don't mind, for this set, it contains sticker. sometimes, i do hope they can give us spare sticker for us to change, after a long period of time. distinct red chimney this is the front of the oven, and that is where the smoke comes out. using only bricks to construct this, is simply wonderful. i like the use of their white bricks to construct the wall layout, and a combination of red parts, especially on the top. i like the look of this very much. another picture on its side printed parts in this set, you will get a total of 5 pizzas! and, i believed no other sets offer so many pizza. you can placed up to 4 pizzas in the van and oven. alice will be carrying the last pizza around. the green and red round dish is a printed part. most exclusive part in 6350/10036 the most unique and important printed parts that is only exclusive in this set. it's at the front of the pizza van. it is none other, but the pizzeria logo, standing at the front of the delivery van. (forgotten to take a picture of this piece, took it from peeron.) different views of pizza to go outlet another bright sunday day in pizza to go! summary review playability: 10/10 (a lot of playing by doing up the pizza process. from preparing to delivery) design: 9.5/10 (outstanding design, with great use of bricks. i like the structure of it very much) price: 9.5/10 (an inexpensive set based on the 1994 pricing. it comes with 3 mini-figs, shop, a van, and a exclusive printed piece) overall: 9.7/10 (i am not trying to be bias. in fact, this set is absoultely filled with minimum flaws. look at my review again, if you are not satisfied with it, or tell me what you don't like!) i gave it a "5" based on my review score card. what about yours? hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. comments and critics are strongly welcomed. pictures can be found in my brickshelf(when moderated)

1 easily one of the best town sets ever (and pretty expensive for its size too, is/was it that rare?). i hope i still have all the pieces from mine, unfortunately, my stickers are in pretty bad shape (took them off because i needed the bricks, stupid stickers covering multiple parts , only downside to this set). the design is simple, yet so detailed, and the pizza van looks great. 5/5

0 i do like the set, although i don't own it. i do remember lusting after it when i was a kid, though (mainly because of the female minifig and the colors). it's a bit simplistic, but comes with a few great parts. you also did a great job on describing the set, and the pictures give the full impression of the appearance. for the review, i just have to point out a few things, to give you constructive criticism: first of all, it's chef, not "chief" (entirely different professions), and secondly, the scale you give in the poll isn't very even. "above average" jumps to "outstanding", which is a too big of a gap in my opinion. you should've used "good" or "great" in between them. but these are only minor faults, this is a good review anyway!

1 a very good set indeed, we have at least 3 of them, but we like them all.

0 jopiek, on aug 24 2008, 10:48 pm, said: a very good set indeed, we have at least 3 of them, but we like them all. what do you mean by "we"? you own three sets of the orignal 1994 series or the 2002 legend series?

1 this set looks really cool, especially for one this inexpensive. the van is neat, and the hidden storage compartment i back is the icing on the cake. i like the back with hidden oven as well, and the rare sink piece makes it all the better. with five pizzas and three minifigs, it's and excellent set to behold.

1 excellent review white fang! - and a great set to commemorate the establishment of classic town.net. i almost ordered this set back when it was re-released by lego, but passed on it. i'm so mad at myself! this has all the terrific qualities that classic town sets exemplify. i love the delivery truck and the pizza oven. a great review from one of the "master eb reviewers" - outstanding!

1 one of my greatest lacks in my town...i can remember going to the store to buy this one, and ending up with another set (pirates) at home :p thank you for the review, it might put me on track in finding this set on the web and purchasing it to correct my childish change of mind, so long ago ;-)

1 excellent job, and one of the best sets in history, if you ask me! 5/5 all the way. this is what we need more of. whitefang, on aug 24 2008, 05:22 am, said: devoted "pizzeria" staff on the left, we will have the pizza boy, whom is wearing the regular blue dungarees and its white cap. i wonder who is that boy? on the middle, we will have the pizza girl. she looks like any typical sweet girl in town that the boys will look at. she is wearing a suntop strapless on her. she reminded me of one person though, i think her name is called alice. taking a careful look, i wonder if imperialshadows is the pizza boy back then, without that black patch on its left eye? on another note, this mini-figure was my favourite. female mini-figures are very uncommon back then. i am glad i have this figure, adding to my town population. hmmm... he does look a little familiar, and i definitely recognise the lovely alice. now stop staring at her. sandy, on aug 24 2008, 06:33 am, said: it's chef, not "chief" (entirely different professions) actually, salvatore, as i like to call the chef, was in the navy where he reached the rank of chief, a nickname he holds to this day. so both work in this case. whitefang, on aug 24 2008, 09:12 am, said: flyut, if you need decals for the stickers that are featured in this set. hang around here until imperialshadows drop by to give you a little surprise if he is free. surprise? free? i'm not even close to free, i'm rather expensive, but i do have a surprise for everyone! i think you'll be interested in the companion article to this fine review, my first set restoration project. again, great job whitefang, excellent review, and tlg, this is a star amongst your sets. think about that when you're designing new ones. seriously.

0 nice review,3 or 4 years ago my dad picked up two large boxes full of classic era legos (classic town,some pirate,and alittle episode 1 star wars etc)i couldn't find the building in this set but i had the little van from this set.its very sturdy, i should know my idiot friend dropped this from my second floor window and it styed togethersure the pizzas fell out and they probably got cold thanks for the review!

1 great review! i really like this set and plan on getting it on bricklink. it would certainly add something to my collection!

0 wow. great review!

1 this set is great and so is this review! i really like seeing reviews of classic sets like this and hope to see more in the future. the chef in this set is the base for my sigfig in fact! the classic sets have a totally different feel to them than the newer sets. they look more human. great review!

1 thanks for all of your kind words and great support for this once famous legend set, which got a second chance to be re-released again for people whom had missed it before. indeed, this is the kind of lego sets which is great addition for any lego town or city. thebrickster, on aug 26 2008, 02:26 pm, said: excellent review white fang! - and a great set to commemorate the establishment of classic town.net. i almost ordered this set back when it was re-released by lego, but passed on it. i'm so mad at myself! this has all the terrific qualities that classic town sets exemplify. i love the delivery truck and the pizza oven. a great review from one of the "master eb reviewers" - outstanding! hope you managed to find a good deal in the internet. that last comment of yours certainly makes my day bright. thanks brickster. you are one of them as well. lockt, on aug 26 2008, 03:52 pm, said: one of my greatest lacks in my town...i can remember going to the store to buy this one, and ending up with another set (pirates) at home :p thank you for the review, it might put me on track in finding this set on the web and purchasing it to correct my childish change of mind, so long ago ;-) what pirate set did you actually buy instead of the pizza to go? hope you are able to find a good buy on the internet. imperialshadows, on aug 26 2008, 04:53 pm, said: surprise? free? i'm not even close to free, i'm rather expensive, but i do have a surprise for everyone! i think you'll be interested in the companion article to this fine review, my first set restoration project. geez, you twisted my words "free" indeed, you are "dear". lastly, thanks for that lovely surprise. i really enjoyed viewing that sweet decals of yours. looks tasty too. imperialshadows, on aug 26 2008, 04:53 pm, said: again, great job whitefang, excellent review, and tlg, this is a star amongst your sets. think about that when you're designing new ones. seriously. actually, this is one of my surviving stars among my sets. well, i will need to find better sets for the new ones. section8, on aug 27 2008, 10:07 pm, said: i got the original version as a surprise one christmas. my parents liked the design so much they got it for me. this is one of the best town sets. if it didn't have the delivery van it would have been on par with 6683 hamburger stand, a great set in its own right. the van, and they way the back holds the pizzas, is ingenious and bumps this set up to the highest levels. i agreed with you. in fact, recently there was a hot topic created by k.d on what is your favourite takeaway. look at here for more discussions and views.

1 definitely one of my favorite sets from my childhood; i still remember my sister getting it for me for my birthday and me building it that same day. too bad i had it displayed all these years on my windowsill so the pizza delivery van and pizzeria have become yellowed.

0 thanks for the nice review of this great set, whitefang! i always want to grab one, but the price to buy it now is too forbidding... i also always think the girl minifig is supposed to be a customer... lego is really up to everyone's own imagination... edited by alywin, 15 may 2009 - 06:27 pm.

1 nice review. i have this set, and i like it alot. its a master peice!

1 indexed allright, hi everybody again! today, i'm gonna review the biggest set of the res-q subtheme, 6479 emergency response center. with this one i think, the reviews of all the res-q sets are complete now, and while i'm in a reviewing mode right now i thought i'd bring that up. this set hast got many nice aspects and also some very rare pieces, and comes with a wonderful amount of vehicles, including a speedboat, a tow truck, a helicopter, and a trike which can pull a little boat. so sit down, get your popcorn and beer, we're off to stormy weather at the coast! sub-theme: res-q set nr.: 6479 name: emergency response center number of minifigs: 5 number of pieces: 420 release year: 1998 unfortunately i don't have many of the boxes of my res-q sets anymore, so i'll start right off with the instructions this time: on the backside there is no alternate model as usual this time, but only a different shot of the whole set: next, a general overview, sorry about the slightly bad picture quality on some pics this time: originally this set has 5 minfigs (which all are really nice!), but the guy who drives the tow truck has been lost in the flood here's a picture of the missing fig: let's move on to the vehicles, we have something for the water, the ground and the air in this set, first the great tow truck: i love the mechanism with the hooks in the back: next on, da speedboat! at the rear, it's got a stretcher and a wench, which adds a lot of playability: if there's a a little accident near the coast, the trike comes to appearance: for more complicated stuff, we have a little helicopter (i broke the rotating piece at the top yesterday, ouch! : ) no space for a victim you say? well, not really, but the helicopter also got a wench with a hook in the back: now it comes to the station itself, at the docks a neat life belt sign is mounted (remember, at this time there weren't real ones as today): a little more right an equipment holder is placed, with various tools on the front... ...and fire fighter equip at the back: at the very front a little lighttower secures the shelter: i haven't quite found out what this thing is supposed to be, maybe somebody knows another equipment holder, this time with all the stuff you need for diving: more equipment... ...and even more! we come to the hear piece of the station, the control room with lots of buttons and scrrens: last but not least, a quick shot of all the accesoires and tools that you get, which really is an a-ma-zing amount! this set might have a few junioriced pieces, as the big window in the front or the "briedge" on the roof, but that doesn't matter, because there is nearly one other set in which you get so much rare pieces and such an overwhelming amount of accesoires, so i can recommend that for everybody who is a pieces-fanatic. not to forget the playability, the great figs and the, in my opinion very good color scheme. once again thanks for taking the time reading and looking at my review, i hope you liked it. edited by thebrickster, 31 december 2009 - 09:19 pm.

1 i own this set and it's one of my favourites, simply because of the cool colour scheme which you mention, plus all the vehicles and accessories. the res-q theme is one of my faves of all time actually, i own nearly all of them (missing a small set that was only available in the us or japan, i think). dr. s.

1 i have this set and it's pretty nice. i love the res-q theme in general. i think that tow truck is easily the highlight of this set and is probably the best such vehicle i've seen in any city set. the other vehicles are also great. the base itself is lacking though, as it basically consists of one room that doesn't even have side walls. it does include a cool 3x6 computer sticker and a vast array of minifig tools and equipment though. i have some plans to modify the building and make it larger but have never gotten around to doing it.

0 i just built this set in mlcad as a requestfor a fellow eurobricks member. somehow i missed out on this set completely when it came out. i was really suprised how long it took to build (virtually). despite its size this set is packed with details, minifigs, vehicles and tools. thanks for all the pictures! gif xml: 6479 emergency response center edited by missouri_bb63, 31 december 2009 - 09:32 am.

1 hi everyone, this is my first review on lego sets here. hope you guys like it. and i would like to apologise for the bad quality pictures. hope you guys don't mind. first i will start with the box art. box art: i guess this is the first time that lego star wars sets use white and blue colour for their box. i like the new colour scheme, a nice blend though. here's the front: the back: not to waste space on the box lego do some advertisement to attract us to buy more sets. :grin:the more the side: at the top side there is this minifigs scale picture. it is great as we get to know the real size of a minifigs. contents: the contents consist of a sticker sheet, instruction book, and 8 packet of bricks. the packer are not numbered. but it is ok as there is not much pieces. instruction book and random page: as usual the instruction book have brick checklist, other sets pictures, and tutorial on how you should assemble your set (i mean the very first page). sticker sheet: there is not much sticker sheet and is a great news that the republic logo on the round plate is printed unlike republic gunship. anyway, i didn't apply the stickers. the commander gear: this is a new thing to minifigs as well. well is like batman accessories, they pack it in one small packet. however, you only get one commander gear pack in this set. anyway, i didn't use them. the minifigs: well, we get the the new minifigs. the ugly face clone, new printed torso and new mold of helmet. however i not really like the new head stud, i prefer a black one or at least the one like jango fett, black colour with face. the helmet: everything is printed, no holes at the visor there, but there are hole on the both side. this new helmet mold also made the headgear turn 360 degree freely. without helmet: with helmet: you can see the flesh tone at the hole beside. the blasters: @ short blasters were given instead of long one. is great, at least they give us two blasters instead of one. the tank: here is the pics of the tank. it was not badly design nor nicely design. but it looks great if you didn't saw the beneath or under the tank. view from front: view from side: view from back: what's beneath? under it was 4 wheels, to make it move fluently. it is made by the thread supporter like the one we fet from tie crawler or bat-tank the functions: well firstly, you can open up the hood (i guess) to see the engine. secondly the side cannon that can move upwards. the thing is quite tight (see random instruction page) and there is barrier to block the cannon from going downwards. the cockpit: well the cockpit is small and the space is limited. the monitor stuff is printed brick and is another great news. you have to remove the piece (pic below) to reveal the cockpit and put your clone to pilot it. pop-up gunner mechanism: well the backdoor have a thing to attack to the seat of the gunner. the top hatch is very loose. so it there is a clone as a gunner and you open the back door, the clone will pop-up and automatically open the hatch on top. this is how the top looks like without a clone. there is this movable cannon (upwards, left and right) and a little keyboard thing with it. but the cannon fall off quite easily. the flick launching missile mechanism: the mechanism is on both side and you need to turn the thing inwards to reveal the flick fire mechanism. below are the pic of how it is turned. you can keep you blaster at the front of the side. there are place for you to store them. it close nicely. completion: this is how it looks like. extra parts: there quite a number of them. overall: this set is not bad. the price is quite expensive but you will like it. the pop-up mechanism is something new (to me) but this set have more function and 2 clone trooper with a pack of commander gear. pros: -2x clone troopers -high playability -nice design cons: -a little expensive -sticker sheet -cannon on top falls off quite easy edited by kimt, 27 august 2008 - 12:16 pm.

0 thanks for that very elaborate review nice to have several pics from different angels. amazingly well done if this is your first i've added a poll and will index this review within this week (along with all the other topics i am to index )

0 yes, the review is great indeed, i love in-depth reviews with tons of photos! as for the set - i'm not planning to buy it, but it looks ok. i think it's a good tank.

0 wow, this is one great review! fantastic pictures, this looks like one cool set with heaps of neat functions. a shame it doesn't include exclusive figures (like ahsoka and captain rex in the at-te or plo koon and asajj ventress in the gunship), but you can't have everything. so again, thanks for this sweet review! ~peace

0 thanks for this great review, baby i like the clarity of your photos, and the description is well written. i'll try and see if i can gather the money for this one (fingers crossed) luxorv

1 bad quality pictures? what's wrong with them? this is a great review and thanks! i was planning on buying this set and no others but the price stunned me. thus i bought the at-te and the rgs.... the set is better than i thought though; i might do as mutley did and make my own!

0 thank you kimt for adding the poll. hehe. this is my first review so, i'm not so confident about the pictures. thank you guys for viewing and commenting.

0 nice review i hope i can get this set [as well as agents, city & other sw stuff...] and nice pics, i didnt think they were bad, i thought they were pretty good

1 splendid photos and well written review! i love it. i've owned and built mine and must say it's a good set and the tank don't disappointment in terms of design and playability. i got mine stickered, well been a perfectionist i am :p thanks again for the review that it should deserved :d

1 baby, i will like to take a moment to said "outstanding piece of review for your first attempt!" you have done well with the pictures and its flow. i have to admit that i love this fighter tank very much. the downside of it which is overpriced, and two clone troopers do not really justify the purchase. well, if i have the spare cash, i will defintely get one of this. keep it up.

1 wow, this ship is really big, judging from the size of its hull!!! wondering where can i keep it when i've bought it. ;)

-1 but does this mean that they add to the piece count? is it a super secret clever way to make the piece count seem bigger than it is? hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm |:| addition i've built it, review up later tonite but here's this to wet your appetite.

-1 it's a shame it only comes with two figs. it would be great for my ancient middle-east project.

-1 they have made a special middle piece in this 4+ set: http://www.brickset....aspx?set=7075-1 the only problem is that it's red.

1 good work samsta! no wonder i wasn't aware. 4+ pirates and all...

0 sam89, on aug 17 2005, 03:08 pm, said: thanks for the pics so far. will you have high-res pics of the other sets in the instructions? there's just the back page ad, but i'll scan it.

1 i'm interested in the scan of the back... i have an idea for a new avatar. :)

1 right so here's my review (finally). the whole gallery of box, parts, minifigs and finished model is here, over 2 pages. so on with the show. minifigs http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1340864 in the set you get krakaroff (i dunno how to spell it) and victor krum. the figs are exactly the same, bar their heads. these are two fantastic figures, the expression on krakaroff's face is priceless. judging by the design i think we might get a yellow krakaroff cropping up somewhere, which would make me a happy bunny (he'd make a fantastic viking) ideally i'd have liked more than 2 figures for my money, three would have done it, i think 2 is too few. piece count http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344573 http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344571 http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344572 for a ?40 set, the piece count is quiet good, i don't know the exact number but when building it, i didn't feel short changed, bar the exception of the hull. now i don't hate the hull, my problem is that is doesn't connect with bricks like the old pirate ships. there are pros and cons to this, on the plus side its more secure, and your whole ship doesn't need to be taken up with support structure. the negative side being, you can't really make it bigger (as they've only released a megablocking 4+ set with the right piece, and its the wrong color). i also like how its wide, meaning you can fit loads of minifigs on the main deck. overall though i liked the pieces. of note are gold studs (http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344510) (5 in total, you get one spare), the return of the black falcon shields (http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1340835) and the new drumstrang shields. the construction a simple fun build. nothing too fiddly. the finished model http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344474 (big picture) i really like this set. there's no bones about it. it seems lego with the latter half of 2005 have given people who loved their original pirate ships hope for the future with this and the fantastic viking longboat. even with the two 4+ pieces (the hull, and front of the ship) i wasn't put off. http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1340841 http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344461 the front of the ship is a nice piece, and can be used for stuff like castles. http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344490 http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344491 http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344492 http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344494 and the hull isn't all bad. what i really liked was the little cargo hold, at the moment i have a treasure chest in there, but there' space for about eight of them i reckon. playability wise it does make alot of sense, and as you can see you can imprision minifigs below deck. http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344484 http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344488 http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344506 http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344500 the quarters are great as well. you can comfortably fit about six minifigs in the main gally, three by the steering wheel, and a couple up above the top cabin. you could fit more, but it'd look strange. my only gripe is the design of the top cabin. when you want to open it up, you have to remove the mast. i know its simple enough, but i think that it wouldn't have taken much for tlc to design it better. but saying that its easily done, and i like how the cabin can be lifted with ease from the steering deck. http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344540 the final play feature is the plank. you can while away the hours murdering hapless minifigs who've displeased the cabin. a really nice addition for pirate fans. the final verdict[/b playability: 9.5/10 - lots to do for all the kids. piece count: 9/10- a great selection, loses one for the hull. figures: 8/10 - just needs one more! construction: 9/10 - nice and simple. value: 8.5/10 - let down a bit by lack of minifigs, and the cons of the hull. [b]overall: 8.8/10 overall this is a set worth getting, especially if you miss proper pirates. it wouldn't take much to turn this into an amazing pirate ship moc. hope you liked my review. matt

1 [burns]excellent...[/burns] i love those parts shots, great stuff in there! this really is a good sign for the new line, hopefully there'll be the same level of usefulness in the others. thanks for taking the time to finish it up! did you scan the back of the instructions?

1 i received this set with a $25 gift card, so it was a great buy. it follow with a similar build to the 2007 trucks, but has a few improvements. of course, the name of the set could have been a bit more creative... and yes, this was an academy review. set name: truck and forklift number: 7733 pieces: 343 theme: city year released: 2008 price: $25.00 usd, ?19.99 gbp, 24.00 euro 1/box now the box follows a design similar to most other city sets. it has the set information and photo of the set on the front, (sorry for it getting cut off, i will remake it). now the back of the box shows what each bag builds. bag 1 is for the forklift, bag 2 is for the cab, and bags 3 and 4 are for the containers. it also has the set's features. 2/contents the instructions: there are 2 books included with the set: one for the forklift, and one for the truck. minifigure(1) the first minifig you build is a simple cargo worker. interesting/new parts: here we have some interesting and new parts. they include a yellow seat, a 1x2 plate with clips, and a 1x4 slope. 3/the build cargo1 the first cargo palette has a few crates on it. i really like the sticker on the small box. forklift: the forklift is a very fun extra to build, and it is probably the best forklift that we have had so far. it is very realistic and is very strong. cargo2 the next piece of cargo is some octan barrels on a meter. i am not sure what it is supposed to be, but it is still a nice addition to the set. minifgure(2) the second minifigure is a classic driver with sunglasses and a coffee mug. very nice. new piece! this is a very nice new piece that is included in the set, a hollow canopy. i believe it is also in white with the police mobile command station. truck: now anyone who has had one of the lego city harbor sets from last year, then you will probably find this build to be very similar. mostly in the cab part of the truck. the trucks build is very solid, and very realistic. i sense ths will bring the ratings up quite a bit. mystery cargo: for some time specualtion has been going around, what exactly is this? it seems like nuero poison.. i am very happy with those 2x2 cylinders in trans-yellow. in fact, you can join in and guess what it may be in this topic. containers: the first container is built to hold one palette. it fits onto the truck. it produces a very pleasing result, and has a better look to it than the containers from last year had. the second container has the ability to hold two palettes, and has a design similar to the first. then, you build on the wheels. the back ones have beautiful mudflaps! finshed set: ---------------------------------- parts: 10/10 (lots of useful pieces, great colors, and some very cool new pieces.) minifigs: 8/10 (i would have liked another but it was $25, so i guess its okay.) price per part: 10/10 (almost 350 pieces for $25. ) playability: 8/10 (forklifts are always fun, and there are lots of things to do with this set.) overall: 36/40 90% a- this is truley an outstanding set, and it will make a great addition to anyones collection. mocers would aslo like this, due to the fact that it has some really nice parts. it has a great build, and utilizes some awesome new techniques. it also has details, something you might look for in a set. highly recommended. hope everyone enjoyed the review! if you have any pic requests, questions, etc., please ask! i look forward to hearing your comments, and the judges comments as well. 7733 peeron.com 7733 bricklink catalog 7733 shop at home

1 metalandi, on aug 27 2008, 03:26 pm, said: thanksfor this review, i also got this set recently, and i'm very happy about it. i live the design of these new trucks, and the forklift is also great. not to forget the good amount of cargo. btw., i think the "mysterious cargo" only are normal fuel barrels thanks! normail fuel would be in those octan barrels...

1 a very fine set indeed and something at least a little different to the more usual city sets. sweet! and it could even be a little sweeter to me with car doors... well, nevermind. thanks for that very nice review, ~vbbn~!

0 great review! i dig this set. it could have only been better if it had been a 6-wide version of the old 6367 semi-truck. still i ask: what's so special about the special edition?

0 the cobra, on aug 27 2008, 09:58 pm, said: still i ask: what's so special about the special edition? hmm...good question. let's hope our reviewer can help us out here.

0 kimt, on aug 27 2008, 05:00 pm, said: hmm...good question. let's hope our reviewer can help us out here. and i can. the set is exclusive to lego brand retail stores, lego s@h, and toys "r" us only.

0 that explains why it isn't in our local stores. i also got it from s@h, but my box hasn't got the "special edition printing" on it, surprisingly.

0 what that? looks like a walker! an imperial walker? no??.. theme: space, blacktron i set name: alienator set number: 6876 number of pieces: 82 figures:1 released: 1988 list price: ?.99 (it seem no source online has the price) peeron.com bricklink.com as always lets have a look at the box first as i?m luck to own a boxed version of this set. walking across a planet with a grid pattern sky! the back shows a great selection of alternative models. after opening the box we find a single instruction booklet inside the instruction booklet now we come to the man in the black visor the mark i blacktron and black and industrial he look. in my opinion i think he probably has the second best lego space torso. before the focus group decided they needed to be brighter now turning to the walker itself, it?s a simple build which i don?t think even i with my great skills for messing up could get wrong. the final unit is built in three key parts. the command pod which is attached to the body by two pins at the back. the walker legs, this is pure design genius. simply built easy to replicate and no fancy parts. the top section which open to reveal the blacktrons high-tech tools. time to put the entire set together, i think you?ll agree it looks great for such a simple build. looking like you could take on the universe. a side view of the finished product. a frontal view of the alienator what the hell! how did that take down an at-at. this is one of my all time favourite lego space sets. actually i didn?t have it pre-dark age and only recently bought one. what attracted me to it was an old boxed set, but since then i?ve discovered a set that i wished i?d owned long ago. the rating system figures: 8/10 (i love the dark industrial space look) parts 7/10 (yes it may be nearly all black with some yellow highlights, but is have a good range and they fit to make several great models.) fun fun fun 8/10 (it walks well and it?s a great set, it has a large number of possible mods.) design 10/10 (it?s ingenious the walking mechanism is so simple and yet so good i can?t fault it price ?/10 (while i could tell you how much i paid i was luck on ebay so this remains a question mark) grand total 33/40 (reduced top level due to lack of price knowledge) conclusion. a set which in my opinion showcases what lego was about in the 1980?s. the set has an excellent design ethic and looks great, with very limited parts it retains great action and functionality. twinned with the great main model you?re shown that there are a number of other great models you can make with the same parts. this set is what it?s all about for me, i?m very glad i bought outside my normal theme when i saw this. actually on the strength of this set i recently order 6894 blacktron invader and can?t wait to get it and see if it lives up to the alienator.

1 as i've told you before, this is a great set and now it has a great review. thanks for this

1 a very original and perhaps even a little weird design indeed, but nice and creative for sure! thanks for that good review!

1 i loved all of these "walker" sets. it was such a smart technique. i made one myself with what i had ...ahhh good times! thanks for the great review.

1 thanks for the review. i'll add it to the index. the y-wing is one of my favourite rebel fighters and this set justifies the coolest fighter

1 pedro, on aug 27 2008, 09:23 pm, said: great review! the y-wing is an awesome starfighter and the detail in this set is superb. funnily enough i was just swooshing mine today! you mean swooshing as in swooshing for real or just plain swooshing?

0 kimt, on aug 27 2008, 10:49 pm, said: haha i was making a joke and here comes stauder with his clearly insane lies. for the truth go here. now can we get back on topic or a you just dying to become sarlac food? oh hush, not like many people know the story. the true story can indeed be found in the interview, so i shall leave you be, for now... edit - also, you should note that you said you would swoosh the ucs y-wing... staudie. ps - sarlacc edited by stauder, 27 august 2008 - 08:55 pm.

1 csiquet, on aug 28 2008, 05:27 pm, said: i've built the y-wing and the imperial landing craft (7659) more or less at the same time and, for about the same prices, i think the imperial landing craft (ilc) is much superior to the y-wing. the y-wing doesnt have much functionality besides an awkward dropping bomb device and a moving cannon. the missiles firing system is  your fingers. the ilc has an awesome missiles firing system (i wish i could get it individually for mocs), a clever bomb dropping mechanism, 5 minifigures with weapons, the wings fold up together and the cargo can be detached as a play set. ive built the ilc first so i got quite disappointed with the y-wing. you've got to be kidding? the ilc is bulky and doesn't even come close to the design superiority of the y-wing. it's smooth, it's beautiful and it's awesomely designed by the designers at lego. "it's got greebles, man!"

1 i like the model, it is one of the best rebel sets out there. but i don't like it that there is no landing gear. when you set this one on the floor/ your rebel base it looks like it crashed or something and looses its look of superiority actually quite fast. it needs to be at least 2 studs high, if not more, from the ground. tlc is in these days afraid of flimsy landing gear, as they gave to us in the early sw time. now they want something sturdy for playability. but i think there should have been some details on the bottom, especially a landing gear that unfolds. i also don't like the mistake of tlc (that they changed this year with the release of indy hopefully) to give the pilot a usual smile face. the old yellow version of gold leader even had a headgear. i hope tlc realised this year that we want more detailed faces. well, the licenced sets we got proved that, but who knows. the upsides of this set are the amount of pieces and detail, especially the engines were fun to build and perhaps the most interesting construction i have seen in years. also it is big, bulky and looks sleek at the same time, just wonderful. and next to the 4502 x-wing it looks in the perfect size! i gave this the highest rating, even if the underside disappoints. but whatever, it is lego, you can add some landing gear on your own! thanks for the review, your pics were really really good, next time make more of them please!

0 csiquet, on aug 29 2008, 02:06 am, said: i was not talking about the looks, of course the rebels have got to have nicer looking ships don't aregue with him when it comes to y-wings. he offerd to swoosh one in the nude... stauder.

1 stauder, on aug 29 2008, 12:37 pm, said: don't aregue with him when it comes to y-wings. he offerd to swoosh one in the nude... stauder. indeed...

0 is it worth the money since the new y-wing comes out next year?

0 yodalikespie, on 03 september 2011 - 07:21 pm, said: is it worth the money since the new y-wing comes out next year? please, check the date prior to asking questions in old topics. three years ago in this case. it's rude to expect people to answer questions like that, especially since it's such a generic question. besides, how is he supposed to answer the question without knowing a lot more about the new y-wing...

-1 etav8r, on 19 september 2011 - 01:55 am, said: i think it is a fair to ask questions here with the expectation of a new y-wing in the coming year. i came here to look at the review even though it is a few years old. no images to go with the review. bummer. i'd like to see a more friendly tolerance on dated threads being bumped. again, we know next to nothing about the new y-wing. it wouldn't be possible to say whether 7658 is worth the money relative to the new one until we know what the new one looks like, what its minifigures look like, how much it will cost, etc. also, note that yodalikespie has been banned.

0 fallenangel309, on 19 september 2011 - 03:43 am, said: not a threat at all - i was simply pointing out that yodalikespie made the mistake of inquiring about the new y-wing before we had any information on it. to my understanding, it's not so much the fact that he bumped the thread as the fact that he bumped it for no good reason. i'm not certain where the moderators stand on this issue, but i feel that yodalikespie's question would have been better received had he posed it after a substantial amount of information had been gathered on 9495 - as i've said, there simply isn't much one can go off of at this point to determine its value relative to 7658. roger that. sad that the original review pics aren't available any longer. would be nice once the new set is released for comparisons.

1 and lo! it came from the east (denmark) the set which had been foretold the cheap army builder and there was much rejoicing amongst the castle fans. the cardinal then asked was all the rejoicing justified.. set name: the knight set number: 5615 number of pieces: 21 figures:1 released: 2008 list price: 2.00 lets us begin with the box. the front shows us are knight and his rack of arms. the back shows us two sets from the castle range. moving inside the box now. the contents of the box, it doesnt look like much. the instructions to help you through the build. now the reason you probably bought the set, well at least why i did the knight. this features the new torso for 2008 and is the height of fashion. this brings the number of printed torsos from the crown knights to three, which allows for a greater variety in building your armies. a new fashion sensation and all the must have accessories for this season. with a more heavily armoured look hes ready for anything. the rest of the set is a weapons rack, i assume that once youve got a few of these set youll probably like me give up building them and part them out. but anyway here are some pictures of what the rest of the elements are spent on. a long and complex build begins. after 360 hour finally its finished sadly five minfigs were hurt in the construction of this rack. now the money shot, where we can see it all come together. it looks great even the rack doesnt look to bad. sadly are hero wasnt ready for other themes just yet. in total we have a good army builder which castle fans have wanted. however there remains a question in my mind as to if this set is good enough on its own. without any other castle sets i cant see it being to much fun so its not a good present. the rating system figures: 9/10 (great new fashion for this season ) parts 8/10 (shield, sword, spear, helmet and armour what more could i want? well two shields.) fun fun fun 3/10 (sadly its rather dull on its own i cant think or to much else to do.) design 7/10 (yes its the army builder ive wanted design, well apart from that pirate one.) price 9/10 (at 2.00 what more can i say.) grand total 36/50 (let down by being to small to stand alone..) conclusion. so lets answer the question, is it the army all castle fans have wanted? well yes and no is the answer. while it is a great set and at the now reduced uk price of 2.00 amazing value. i still think its inferior compared with the army building capability of cross bow attack, i much prefer army building both factions at once.

1 thanks for sharing this review with us. i'll add it to the index. one of my favourite impulse sets along with the troll warrior (or is that orc warrior)

1 nice review and i especially enjoyed the ending. i personally think it is quite a good set for the price considering it comes with a fully armed minifig along with enough stuff to suit up another. i just wish amazon carried this set.

-1 do we really need more construction works? legoland is just one huge building site. theme: city set name: mini digger set number: 7246 number of pieces: 36 figures:1 released: 2005 list price: $3.50 (usd) 7426 peeron.com 7246 bricklink catalog diving right in let get some photos of the box the digger at work. the back just has more of the same not to inspiring. once we open the box we find two poly bags and some instructions the total contents of the box, well minus the air instruction booklet short and simple. now the single minfig of the set, nothing new of special that i can see. got a job working construction for the johnstown company. moving onto the digger itself, its one of those builds where all you really need is a quick glance at the instructions and off you go. side view of the finished product. alternative view, it doesnt look to bad. now lets add our construction worker. looks rather good, though the lifting action isnt smooth. its nothing special, its not the greatest construction set that lego have ever produced but i think it is worth the money. the arm action really does bug me though. the rating system figures: 5/10 (just another construction peon.) parts 4/10 (nothing novel and i dislike the new digger arm system.) fun fun fun 7/10 (i think the playability is high and you can get a good load of bricks in the bucket.) design 6/10 (not the best designed digger but not the worst.) price 7/10 (a reasonable price for what you get) grand total 29/50 still halfway decent but nothing to write home about conclusion. this set is yet another in a long line of lego digger and to be honest its not the best in my opinion. i still hold nostalgic memories for 6504 which i still think is a great digger. from my point of view the set sits to high off the ground and make me wonder how the worker gets in. i really dont like the digging arm action it will never be smooth and while it poses better i just think its inferior. despite this i still think its not a bad set, id just like it to be so much more.

1 another fine review! i love the last (action) picture. thanks for sharing! btw, i am so looking forward to that 384 london bus review.

1 finaly we get a new mech for takeshi. and yes, it's yellow. it brings back some flashbacks of supernova. good times. anyways, i recieved this set at christmas last year, with 3 other ef sets. set name: assault tiger number: 8113 pieces: 163 theme: exo-force year released: 2008 price: 15.00 usd, 18.95 eur 1/box the boxes this year are much different than those from previous years. it has some gaps in it, and has a cardboard backround inside of it. the box itself shows assault tiger and the set information. the back shows a combiner. the cardboard backdrop: a very nice jungle look to it. it has lots of fog as well, creating a pale effect. 2/contents the instructions: the instructions are clear, and straight-forward. also included is a lego "blooper." the remains of the sticker sheet: the stickers aren't too bad. i didn't apply the saw sticker as i wanted it to be left plain. the buzzsaw: a very cool piece. mocists will love this. 3/build the figures: the figures included are takeshi, who features a nice new torso. also included is the mini robot. his is a very neat little guy, but sadly, he doesn't really become a weapon. more of a block of red and black bricks. the torso: now the torso design for assault tiger is very different from the past years. it now uses a castle-like piece as the main structure. also of note is that he has a mini throne. no controls, sadly. and with the orange cockpit piece, it's impossible to see takeshi when looking at the at close on. see the third pic. the legs: the legs are slightly similar to the mt-201 ultra drill walker's, but have been modified to fit the at. they are quite large, and suit their purpose. the arms: the arms follow a new design, but the only problem is, they have no elbow or hand articulation. nice weapons though. the finished product: ----------------------- parts: 10/10 (lots of useful pieces, great colors, and some very cool new pieces.) minifigs: 8/10 (a robot would have been nice, and a better weapon mode for the mini-robot would have been good.) price per part: 7/10 (a stretch...) playability: 8/10 (the lack of elbow and wrist articulation isn't the greatest. overall: 33/40 82.5% b- assault tiger is a nice set, but some of those small little things can truly take a toll on the final rating. i think that i would only recommend this set to anyone who wants the yellow, and hardcore exo-force fans. s@h link peeron link i hope you enjoyed the review, and if you have any pic requests or questions, please ask. edited by sinner, 01 september 2008 - 01:52 am.

1 thanks for the review, ~vbbn~. i have to say, ef has never really caught my attention, but this set seems alright. to be honest, when i saw the topic title, i was expecting a tiger- looking mech. the mech itself is cool, except for the huge leg pieces. i think the minifigs are great in ef sets, with the dark colored outfits, like dark red or dark green.

1 thanks for that good review, ~vbbn~. thats really a fine and pretty solid looking mecha. i think that the designers did a good job on this last wave of ef sets, and the inclusion of these mini robots was also a pretty smart idea!

1 nice to see a well done review. this set is one of the few exo-force sets i haven't built myself yet, but i will get it on sale, guess soon. i'm do not like the use of slizer-style ball-joints in exo-force, even though they are modified to 2x2 bricks. in this particular set i think the arms look weak, and they lack elbow joint like the "green 2008 mech" set. (forgot name of this years green mech). quite a shame, i find it really hurts the functionality of that "green" set and could imagine the same with the "tiger". i guess with the new pyramide brick as cockpit, the cockpit is still open from the sides and the back. i modified my "green 2008 mech", which use the same cockpit design, with a few green bricks, and it is now completely closed from all sides. i rate the tiger at average, but i may change my mind when i get to build it myself. front

1 this was my first exo force set and i was quite skeptical towards the mecha theme, so i got it because it seemed to have nice parts. it turned out however that the mechas are quite nice :) i really like the poseability of it and since then i got another ef set.

1 since my last post i've had the chance to build the tiger, and i was surprised in a good way. a much better set than i actually thougth. front

1 i just bought 2 of them since they were 5$ each from lego. i really wish they did not cancel this series.

1 i think this is almost the best set in the exo force line. i really like the orange cockpit peice

1 good review. i got 2 of those. wheels are very useful, especially if you don't have any :) as for shields - i don't imagine trolls use them too much. i think that they fight berserk style - all out assault. one complaint is the piece that the wheels are attached to - its a single piece, with smaller than the standard pin connection. so you cant change the width of the cart for your mocs using the wheels. i don't know if a piece with such a connection only on one side exists though ....

1 kimt, on aug 29 2008, 06:55 am, said: best impulse set so far. agreed, i love this little sets, i can't wait for it to hit shops here. the rodent problem is funny but i lov always getting more animals, so that is a plus. the cart is a nicely formidable machine that i will keep together so i can maximise their fire power. the troll figure is one of my favourite ever too, i love that torso and helmet, and i want that sword in grey, i only have it in bronze. thanks for the review! batbrick away!

0 thanks for the interview, i nearly forgot this set is out yet. maybe i'll grab one off my local store tomorrow.

1 nice review, makes me want 3 honestly. and comgratz on becoming a teacher in the reviewer's academy.

0 nikola bathory, on aug 28 2008, 11:47 pm, said: wait a second, a "troll"?? isn't that an orc? i thought that this is a troll: those are giant trolls. the regular sized green guys (such as is included with this set) are trolls. yes, they look like orcs but lego calls them trolls.

1 nice review! i never new trolls had fireworks, at least that's what it looks like to me. maybe i shall build a trollish fireworks company! fireworks on!

-1 i'm not really impressed by this set as much as other impulse sets. the knight impulse set #5615 offers more in my opinion since it gives two helmets, two weapons, a shield and an armor piece along with the weapon rack. i'm not a fan in the slightest of flickfire missles and projectiles like on the cart, and the previously mentioned one piece axle limits the wheel usage in other mocs. i would've liked to see an added chest armor piece at the very least and a shield would've made this great. those things are so rare and it would've bumped the piece count up to 21 to match the knight set. since both are showing the same price on s@h(in us dollars at least), it would've made sense.

0 thats the problem i couldnt quite tell what, its a bit of a problem in a reviewer. maybe a hose to clip to the fire hydrant i dont know.

0 cardinal brick, on aug 28 2008, 06:36 pm, said: fairly standard mission mars spaceman, hes got printing front and back but sadly no air tank! how does he breath? parts 6/10 (lots of white and not much orange, but wheres the air tank!) as you said, he has printing on the back, if you look closley you wil lsee a tank printed on his back with "oxygen" written on it. stauder.

0 something i forgot to mention is that great review xenologer, on aug 28 2008, 08:28 pm, said: makes me think i ought to try modding the robot later... mod the robot? why? you should see the interior! stauder.

1 kimt, on aug 28 2008, 09:52 pm, said: i'd rather get another impulse set than this. except the other life on mars mars mission impulse sets. actually i kinda like the crystal hawk impulse. the default model isn't that great but you get a few nice wing plates to work with (after rearranging it looks pretty good). i guess this one though, is good for some nice parts, tho its pretty limited in what you can rebuild it into, and it seems less value because the astronaut has no vehicle... best impulse set has to be the troll warrior... feels very 'complete', and space orcs are always nice to have...

1 this here was a set that i new i had to get. a beautiful minfig, amazing minfigs, what more could you want? so was this set worth it? i guess you will just have to read the review to find out! set name: the batcycle: harley quinn's hammer truck number: 7886 pieces: 267 theme: batman year: 2008 price: 35.00 usd, 44.96 euro 1/box the new box art for batman is pretty stunning. it's clean, and really sells the set. for this set, harley quinn's truck is pictured attacking batman, with the set information. the back of the box shows a nice little comic, the other sets, as well as the set functions. 2/contents the instructions: the instructions for the set are, as always, clear and straightforward. they display the colors well, and have what we expect in an instruction book. 3/build minifigs: the stars of the set! batman is back with a new torso, much more metalic than before. harley had all new printed torso, legs, a new head, and that sweet new hat. batcycle: the bottom part is very sturdy thanks to a small bit of technic. the red throws it off a bit, but it isn't seen once the top part is put on. it has a nice use of the smoke stacks, and looks very nice in the end. the top part is simple, but suits the purpose well. it has handle bars, and a nice motor. the blue is a little strange though. hammer truck: the hammer truck begins with a very sturdy base. it has lots of detail, and really looks cool. rims added: lego did a very nice job at giving it a checker board appearence. the only problem here is that you stick a sticker over two bricks, multiple times. jewels: inside of the crate are these shining jewels. look how they illuminate the darkness in gotham... more added: then, we add on a spoiler and the crate. looking very nice now. the detail is again, outstanding, and it has a good amount of smoothness to it. the infamous hammer! okay, i haven't said this yet, but the square pieces need to stop. first on those sw backta tanks, now on the hammer? it creates a sloppy look for the hammer. still, this is the ultimate wacking weapon. added to the truck: on the truck it works pretty well. but the handle is to short, and it's near impossible to smash batman. the finished truck: the finished truck is really nice. the big wheels give it the monster truck feel, and the way that lego alternated the colors works well. the cockpit is a little palin, but that's not a major issue. the "i love joker" sticker is one of the best stickers i've seen. it's simply a classic. the finished set: ---------------------------- parts: 9/10 (lot's of good mocing pieces, and red and black are always usefull.) minifigs: 10/10 (awesome!) playability: 9/10 (the hammer is a little short) price-per-part: 8/10 (it's a liscensed theme, so meh.) set 7886 is a very nice set, and has some great details in it. the minifigs are very cool as well. however, their are some flaws. first, the hammer is two short, and is kind of square. the batcycle has a few awkward colors in it, which throws it off a bit. this set is definatly worth the money. batman fans will love it. and also wacking fans will like it, for that hammer... and if you would like to buy this set, here are a few useful links: s@h link peeron link please let me know your comments. and pic requests and questions are welcome!

0 i saw two stickers next to the window. one said "whack him" but i can't make out the other one. can you post a picture of it? good review, by the way!

1 cool! i also like the sticker on the back of joker's ice cream truck that says "i love gotham"!

1 cues the indy theme song let's follow indy on his pursuit on the stolen ark. indy rides full speed ahead on his white horse, but the nazis are pulling away! will indiana jones be able to grab on to the truck and reclaim the treasure? or will the nazis and their high-powered mercedes trucks prevail? let's find out! 7622 race for the stolen treasure set info set name: 7622 race for the stolen treasure theme: indiana jones released: 2008 price: 29.99 usd 34.95 euro 24.99 gbp pieces: 272 minifigs: 4 price per piece: about 11 cents and now, the main event! first, the box shots the front shows a nice image of indy on his horse, trying to make it on to the truck, and the attack truck taking aim. the back this side shows some of the features of the set, in little pictures on the left. instruction manual not much to say here, as it's the same picture as on the box. inside the manual on one of the last pages we have a nice picture like the one on the back of the box, showing some features of the set. random manual pic here we have the nice piece call-outs that we have come to expect lately. the bags were numbered as well. the pieces a nice selection here, especially if you like black, dark bley and bley. "cool" pieces the golden treasure chest has a really nice sparkle to it. the set also has a good assortment of coins and jewels, and some wonderful silver 1x1 dots. the canvas covering this is quite nice. it has a nice dark tan color, and some nice detail on it as well. the minifigs first comes indy's beautiful white horse. i always like lego animals and this one is no exception. here are the figs on the left indiana jones, and his nice stubble, printed legs, side bag and the best lego hat in history. and the nazis, peter, hans, and klaus. their torsos are very nice and the hats are amazing. they look really nice with all of their tan. the extra parts here you get two of the nice silver 1x1s, some clear 1x1s, and the usual technic pins and levers. now the finished set! first we have the attack truck the truck looks very good. it looks very military like with the colors and the design. it is designed wonderfully with really nice mudguards and a well-detailed front. the only fault of this is i think the top part where the gunner stands is a bit bare. the front here you can see the front, which has a nice smooth look with some nice details as well. the front ridged piece works well here. the gun this is well made. it is built by attaching a lightsaber hilt in a sort of videocamera piece. the actual area where the guy stands is pretty bare, but not too bad. backside of the truck the spare tire here is a simple, but nice touch. a side view the mudguards are smartly built by clipping wing flaps on to handle plates. this part gets a bit tedious, but the end result is worth it. the big boy cargo truck! this is another really well built truck. it has a lot of the same design elements as in the smaller truck, such as the mudguards. front view the front of this truck is as nice or better than the other truck. it uses good snot building, and everything fits in well. a close-up view of the tire area just behind the tire you can see those silver 1x1s being used as the suspension. this is a really nice addition and it looks great. note: it's only visual suspension. it is not supposed to work. the canvas cover in action now the canvas attaches by putting the holes in the canvas, on some little blue technic pins and then clamping them down with the hinged pieces. it looks really nice and curves nicely. the windscreen treasure! my favorite piece in action. i took this picture with the flash on, so you can see how it sparkles. i think we have waited far too long for this great piece. the complete set! everything all together. indy is chasing fast! indy's got it! brickshelf folder now, for the ratings! price: 9/10 (not bad, but could have slightly more pieces. at least it has 4 minifigs and that makes up for it.) parts: 9/10 (a nice selection of parts, lots of greys and black.) design: 10/10 (the trucks are really well-designed, the mudguards are excellent.) playability: 8/10 ( i always like rolling the trucks across the floor. ) build: 9/10 (pretty good, but gets a bit repetitive in some parts.) overall: 45/50 brickset bricklink entry peeron lego s@h even after intense fighting, everyone always gets along when there's food to be eaten... "hey indy! vant some mustard?" "how about some ketchup?" summary this, and all of the other indiana jones sets are some of my favorites. they all have nice colors, good design, and great minifigs. although i need indy in a different outfit pretty soon. his outfit is starting to smell a bit ripe . this set in particular is very well designed, and i can't wait for some more indy next year. thanks, and happy building! edited by erdbeereis1, 29 august 2008 - 03:47 am.

0 great review! hmm, i notice that the leg of that old guy is not so perfect. perhaps you want to push it?

-1 nice review. i really want this set, but i think the 35 here is too much (more like 25 would suit) and haven't found it cheap enough on ebay yet incl. shipping.

1 great job on this review. i just that last picture. i've got a small remark to add. the first picture is not hosted on in your bs account. i suggest you download it on your pc and move it to your bs account. that way you can make sure it isn't going to disappear in the near future.

1 i discovered this review a month ago and since that point in time, i could not get the image of the sparkling golden chest out of my mind. i finally just purchased the chest for myself. i suppose this is a testament to how well honed your picture taking skills are. this set is definitely a nice one. i'm not a lego indy collector, but i was tempted to purchase this set several times. the vehicles are very nicely detailed and have some cool building techniques, such as the wheel guards.

1 very good review

1 great review, i was debating on whether or not to snag this up before its gone, and i think i will, great review and thanks again!

1 another great review erdbeeries! i have to give it a i have thought about this set long and hard and your review might just force me to pick it up. the vehicles look nice and the nazi's are great figs. bravo.

1 welcome to another sunny day in legoville...today we will be joining the mailman on his daily route delivering the day's mail. when i first saw this set, i immiediately liked it.i think tlg should make more of these everyday life type sets such as delivering mail, going to the grocery store, things like that. anyway, enough blabbering, on to the review! 7731 mail van set name: 7731 mail van year: 2008 theme: city pieces: 66 price: $7.99 pounds 4.99 euros 5.95 price per piece: about 12 cents we'll start with the box shots. the box is an interesting shape that i have never seen before. very rectangular. the box art is pretty nice. the back shows the mailman delivering some mail. the picture on the front is the same as on the box. random manual shot. the manual does not have the piece call outs, but on a small set like this, i don't feel it's needed. parts list. decent selection of parts. i really like the mail pieces. image at the back of the manual showing all of the cargo sets together in a little scene. i like it when the manuals have images like these because it's nice to see all of the sets together. all of the parts spread out. the parts in this set are pretty good. unfortunatly the car base is one large piece, however, we do get 2 printed mail pieces which are always nice. our trusty mailman. this torso i think is very nice. the little envelope is a nice touch. extra parts. not much to say here... the finished set! i really like the design of the van. it looks very smooth and somehow looks very lego to me. the colors are my favorite part. the red and yellow look nice together a nice mailbox. however i wish the letter on the front was printed. the front of the van is nice i think. the textured brick on the front gives it a different look on the front which is nice. the back of the van. the doors open to store mail, although it doesn't have much room, i like that they included this feature. delivery! the mail bricks slide right into the hole at the front. this adds nice playability. the van's all loaded up! we are ready to deliver! ======================= parts: 7/10 (pretty good piece selection, but for $8, should have included a few more.) playability:8/10 (it's fun to deliver the mail to all of your town's residents.) design: 9/10 (the design is very nice, except i feel that some of the stickered parts could have been printed.) overall: 24/30 after a long, hard day of delivering mail, there's nothing like enjoying a nice pizza and letting your hair out. why do they make us wear those silly hats anyway... this is a nice set that i can definitely recommend and i think tlg should certainly release a post office to go with this and the air mail set. i really like these everyday life sets rather than always fighting crime or putting out fires. those guys have normal lives too! brickshelf folder: http://www.brickshel...ry.cgi?f=338718

1 this set is nice it looks like a dhl van

1 legoman132, on aug 29 2008, 03:35 pm, said: this set is nice it looks like a dhl van funny, thats what i thought when i first saw the pics good review btw oh and i keep meaning to get this set but keep forgeting..

1 it's a good set, but i think the first sticker shouldn't say "7731"

1 legoman132, on aug 29 2008, 06:35 am, said: this set is nice it looks like a dhl van makes you wonder if there was some kind of promo or hookup in the pipeline that never happened?? i have this set and i really like it. it works well with either the new city sets or with my older 1980s/1990s sets. i actually like the use of the old style car base and mourned the day that these became exitinct the first time round (c1990). thanks for the review! cheers rog

-1 it's an ok set. i just don't really like the look of the van much. too rounded for my liking. what happened to the box like cars??

1 thanks for that very nice review, erdbeereis1. its great to see some other city sets beside the usual hospital, police and firefighter mayhem, and this is a really nice little one. now give me some car doors and a kevin costner-like mf and im a happy camper indeed, tlc...

1 nice review. i like this little set. some how it reminds me now of "postman pat" in dutch "pieter post", an english childrens tv series about a postman in a little village somewhere in yorkshire. aah, sweet memories i would rather have seen a postoffice released (with some women minifigs) instead of the green post bigplane. but maybe in a couple of years.

1 i do like the set also. i've bought 2 of them. one to build it up and one to keep it misb (i dunno for how long ). only poor things is that the wheels are too wide. car is 5nops wide instead of 4. afterall a good design. i wonder if there's a post office coming soon. by the way, great review.

1 welcome to another sunny day in lego city! the sun is shining, the birds are singing, minifigs are drowning.... wait? what?! the coast guard rushes to the scene and deploys the coast guard 4wd & jet scooter to save the poor minifig from drowning. let's take a look at the coast guard's buggy! 7737 coast guard 4wd & jet scooter set info set name: 7737 coast guard 4wd & jet scooter theme: city-coast guard released: 2008 price: 9.99 usd-9.95 eur-7.99 gbp pieces: 130 minifigs: 1 price per piece: about 8 cents now, the review! the box here is the front. it shows a nice image of the buggy on the beach with the ocean in the background. the back the back shows some of the features in the set, such as the extra equipment. manual the picture on the manual is the same as on the box as usual. the parts the set has great colors. i love how the orange, blue and white look together. the part selection is quite good, but unfortunately uses the large car base. coast guard minifig this is a great fig. the torso print is very nice and matches the buggy's colors well. new tire mold here are the new tires. they look very good. in-manual shot color separation is not a problem here, and since it is a small set, the piece call out is not a necessity. extra parts it is always nice to get extra cheese slopes. the finished set! the design of the trailer and jetski is great. the jetski is very smooth looking and the color scheme is fantastic. the sticker on the roof is nice, but it's actually too big for the piece. the corners of the sticker flap where the piece curves. jetski close-up here you can see how it attaches to the trailer. i didn't add the sticker that goes on the front which is a little sign that says bb-03 or something. attaching the trailer this is where the trailer connects to the main car. it attaches simply with a ball joint. car front view the license plate is a nice sticker, and the top lights look nice. say cheese driver! the back the back is very similar to the front, it has the same sticker. the equipment rack a very welcome addition to the set. it adds quite a bit of playability. the orange fins are great. all decked out he looks pretty spiffy in his diving suit doesn't he? brickshelf folder the ratings! price: 10/10 (you can't get much more in here for $10) parts: 9/10 (nice selection and great colors. the big car base is a bit annoying) design: 9/10 (the jetski is a prime example of something with a small amount of pieces that still looks amazing) playability: 9/10 (you can drive the car, go diving, and jetski across the bay) minifig: 7/10 (the one it comes with is great, but it could have come with one more. perhaps a citizen of some sort) build: 8/10 (simple, but looks great) overall: 42/50 lego s@h brickset peeron bricklink even in the face of danger, this member of the coast guard always has a smile on his face... summary simply put, for $10 you have to buy this set. it is one of the better sets in this price range you can buy, and one of the best small city sets. the colors are great, the design is great, and the fig is great. i don't normally think small sets are worth heavy praise, but this one definitely deserves it. thanks, and happy building!

1 what an outstanding review of a great set. i esp. like your intro. i have this set, but have not opened it yet. it looks like a fun little beach set. the new coast guard theme is very nice! edit: this set could almost pass for classic town, except for the use of orange and the lack of opening doors on the car. 5 stars!

1 great job! i will want to get this set soon. it's a lovely set, with some coast guard saving on the jet ski. what i don't like about this set, is the lack of doors. everything about this is nice, but i still have to give it a "4". as for the entire flow of review, i agreed with brickster that your introduction is very good. with the little amends i had added earlier, it turns out to be very good. keep it up.

1 i am not a fan of city/town/train-stuff. but this is a very good review, that almost makes me wish i had the time (read: money) to purchase some of the coast-guard sets.

1 a very good review of an especially charming and lovely set, thanks! the whole cg theme looks very nice to me with a good and detailed set design, and this ones no exception. although it would be nice to see more car doors and some new mf faces, though.

1 thanls for the review, i was looking at this set last time i went to the lego store, but in the end decided not to get it. now youve made me really doubt my decision. one question though do you think the jet ski is as good as previous ones?

1 rriggs, on sep 2 2008, 08:50 am, said: you do get a piece call out with this set (i did anyway). it's on the back of the small poster that is included in the set! i meant the piece call outs during the build that show which pieces you need for that step. and cardinal brick, i'm not quite sure what you mean, but i cetainly think that this jetski is wonderful.

1 i agree that this is a very good looking set. i just finished building mine yesterday, and i love it. but here is one suggestion. trim the large sticker that goes on the roof of the vehicle by cutting along the angles at the front of the sticker. if you use it as it is, it will extend beyond the "flat" surface of the roof and will overlap the lower sections. past experience with stickers has suggested that this sticker will "lift" at the front corners. lego stickers are probably the best that there are, but sometimes modifications must be made. now i want that large coast guard helicopter, #7738!!!

1 nice set, nice review, i already have one coastguard set (that truck) but i like the idea very much. however, the rigid inflatables could be much improved (see the real ones at www.rnli.co.uk or www.knrm.nl)

1 great review of a great set! one question: how does the robot-arm-piece connect to the jetski?

1 the coast guard sets are very eye catching. the color scheme is making me want to pick up the entire line, although the off-shore platform hasn't been released state-side yet. i've had my eye on this particular set for a few weeks now and is near the top of my to buy list. with instructions provided on lego.com, i build a dr. infero version of the jet ski to replace the one used in mission 2: swamp raid. it's a very sturdy design, bulky enough to make it feel like a real vehicle. great review, too. thank-you for the closer look at the set.

0 erdbeereis1, i've had a quick look your review and i must say it's quite superb! i'm dead tired so i'm going to take a nap but i'll be back later to read it more thoroughly.

1 i had to vote outstanding on this set because it simply is, great minifigs, a cool head sculpture and a nice little boat means unlimited playability, great review though man!

1 as i've already said somewhere on this forum, this is the largest islander set i own and therefore my favourite. thankyou for your great review. i picked mine up for only 5 pounds along with crocodile cage and king kahuka, but i can't help you with the original price. i would search the web but i'm too tired right now...

1 what a great review of an excellent set. i love the islanders and that drum (outstanding!). i think these islander sets never got the credit they dserved. i really like this set and it's a great addition to the pirate collection.

1 what a wonderful review with smart (showing the right parts) and clear pictures. fantastic job erdbeereis1! this set is interesting for several reasons. first of all it contains a large amount of (very) useful minifigs. not many sets of this size contain so much figs. secondly, the throne itself can be easily combined with the other islander sets or even with other pirate and non-pirate sets. i'm going to see if i can get this one for a reasonable price on ebay.

1 great review, well done for sure!! i love these reviews of old set, and this one is especially unique. i must agree with you the color scheme is magnificent. makes me want to go to ebay and buy it now! to bad for spongebob though, he got in with a real bad crowd...

1 excellent review! i want this set now!

-1 thanks for the great review. this set is pretty standard as islanders go, but it is such a cool subtheme that i don't care a bit. i totally agree with your comment about old and new sets. i don't think i would enjoy lego as much if i didn't have a decent amount of kits from pre 1999.

0 another very nice review, and im glad to see it has some nice pieces as well as characters too. looks to me that no one on bl has it in australia for sale so i may pass on this beauty. though i did pick up king kahuka recently. he makes an appearance in my medium entry

0 $17 for an old set is good. i may hunt for it on ebay. :)

1 an outstanding set because who doesn't love islanders. outstanding review as well.

1 an outstanding set, too bad that i couldn't get this set set when it came out ...

1 very solid set. 5 minifigs and plenty of weapons to go around, adding up to great playability, what more could you want? (aspecially from a set this size) only i would have liked another cutlass, a musket (instead of 1 of the pistols) and for 1 of the pirates to have another head, but those things are no big deal, it is still a lot better than sets nowadays. edited by fluyt, 23 december 2008 - 09:50 pm.

0 those indians look useful for indiana jones in the future {as long as the have the new skin color} i wish i could have picked one of those up when i could.

0 well, this is a not so old set and i bet most of you already have it. so here is another review from me. as usual, let us start off with the box art. box art: i like the box art. they put a nice background for the at-ap. at the side we have the minifigs scale and at the back there is the function shown and advertisement for other set. the content: the content is consist of 6 packets of bricks and a instruction book. yeap, no sticker sheet. instruction book: the instruction books not only show us the steps but also show us all a clear pictures of the january release sets and some sets show with their function. well, this includes the at-ap functions as well. besides, there are bricks checklist as well and the how do you start off before assemble your sets and a little poster where the clones with their at-ap battling the droids. here's a random page. new pieces (to me): i never see both of this piece before so i assume it is a new pieces. anyone have any idea is there any other sets that contains this piece? the blasters: we are given a 2 long blasters which is great. which i it is more accurate as most of the clone troopers use a long blaster. the minifigs: the minifigs is 2 shock trooper but is different with #7655 clone troopers battle packs's shock trooper. the leg is different in colour, we are given white hip while the one in the battle pack are given a black hip. furthermore, we get a new printed headgear, which i think they have improve it, check out the mouth printing, the colour is brighter. so here is the headgear: the headgear limit itself from turning to the side this is because the front part it is too low until it block by the torso. the shock troopers: without helmet on: we are given a black stud, no face printed. how i wish that i have extra. with helmet on: comparison with shock troopers from battle pack: the at-ap: here's the at-ap. it looks ugly at a certain angle and looks great in a certain angle. anyway i still like the set. i like the walker vehicle. below are the pictures taken randomly: top view: side view: without stabilizer leg: with stabilizer leg: rear view: the functions: well, the functions are not so impressive. just something turning around, open here and there. the only function that is say as special is the retractable stabilizer leg. the cockpit: the cockpit can fit two clone troopers but too bad we are only given two and is not enough as there is no gunner on top. inside it there is a guns holders, which can hold two guns but fall off easily when you are trying to remove the guns. well the other side have some speedometre thing and a controller. to reveal the cockpit, you have to open the top hatch. look below: so you can see what's inside: oops, the side hatch and back hatch as well: open and close: i think this pieces is use not to let you open the hatch but to make some design, i mean make it able to move inside. with clones: beneath: so this is the pieces that hold the stabilizer leg when is not in use. this is how the stabilizer leg move: at last~ and of course the revealing cockpit from below and at the back. guess the droids have alternative way to take this things down faster. the leg: there are pieces blocking the leg to go to the front i mean overhead and lose balance. the base in not movable the side armor: the side armor has door and this is how it is attach. it is very flimsy, when you want to adjust it to be a little steep to creat the shape, they might just fall off. so it is connected to the body with just a technic pin. and to hold it properly, here is the support: the side hatch: it open and close easily, very loose, nothing to hold it tight. here's some view when the side hatch is open. the cannon: the cannon on top is movable and adjustable. the big cannon can move up and down while the smaller one can cove sideways. but the smaller one tend to lose balance when it is without minifigs, means the one on top and below will not b align. this is the pieces that only enable it to move up and down. to prevent it from moving freely, lego put two pieces to block it. completion: i try to make the sets looks great. i think this angle is right. spare parts: it is so few compare with #7673 magna guard starfighter and it is more expensive. overall: this set is not really a good set. the hatch is quite flimsy, top and the side since there is nothing to hold them tight. besides, it is lack of one clone. but to complete your walker collection, you must have it. pros: -no sticker needed -new improved headgear -long balsters cons: -lack of clone -flimsy -expensive as few pieces are given] hope you guys like it. edited by kimt, 30 august 2008 - 12:01 pm.

-1 i do not like the fact that the clones have pure white legs. it looks weird to me. it was also weird that they included shock troopers, but it was probably a way to get people to buy it. this set also seems like one of those that was kind of thrown in with a mix of other sets like the tie crawler. i never picked it up, and with the new clone wars sets out, i won't.

-1 i agree, the pure white legs are odd, as is the inclusion of shocks instead of pilots or regulars. or maybe even kashykk troopers; that might have been better.

1 stauder, on aug 29 2008, 08:45 am, said: has anyone noticed the boxart includes the 3rd leg both in the lowerd position as well as the raised one? stauder. i believe that's to show off the functions of the set. nice review, you carefully explained every detail and i think that i'll buy this set now. i'm glad lego decided to make two seat's in the interior and they did a very nice job on the third leg looking good both up and down. i think i will switch the hips of the shock troopers into black, like the other shock troopers.

0 stauder, on aug 29 2008, 02:45 pm, said: has anyone noticed the boxart includes the 3rd leg both in the lowerd position as well as the raised one? stauder. it's not the 3rd leg, it's the other main leg. zoom in and take a closer look.

1 technic rotation joint disc set list. it's used in 10 different sets so far, not exactly a new piece a nice review with many good comments. i really like this set. it's one of the walkers with really good design and a lot of playability. it's the usual issue of using too many technic pieces to make a moveable feature versus minifig-scaled design. the same issue concerns for example the at-at, the twilight and the at-te (plus more sets). what annoys me in this set is the use of the 2 tan 4x8 plates. they "stick out" and it would have been better if they (the designers) had used dark grey or light grey plates. also i'll add this to the inventory - now!

-1 i could have gotten this set if i wanted to but it seemed like a waste of money to me. i don't like the shock troopers helmets that much. i feel they should have printed visors instead of cut out ones like they have in my opinion it would make it look a lot better. the at ap itself sounds like it has a lot of holes in its cockpit which drags the set down and make it seem like they haven't exactly put a lot of effort into it. great review!

1 wow talk about a bumper! nice review baby! this set is quite nice, i would have goten it if i had had the money but didn't back then so didn't get it. it has a nice parts selection! why did lego do the shock troopers with white hips? and the bp ones have black hips. confusers me. commanderfox

1 product: 7681 separatist spider droid (ssd) theme: star wars: the clone wars no of pieces: 206 release date: 26 july 2008 rrp: sgd59.90/usd29.90 availability: lego shop@home, target, toys 'r' us (worldwide). quote conquer the galaxy, one planet at a time! unleash the power of the separatist spider droid! this towering engine of mechanical destruction from the clone wars strides across hostile terrain on four independently positionable stilt legs, then uses its movable laser cannons to blast republic forces. includes commander fox, clone trooper, battle droid, super battle droid and battle droid commander minifigures! rotate the laser cannon on top! laser cannon underneath bends to change direction! measures 6" (15cm) tall and 10" (27cm) wide! also known as the homing spider droid, this is what i would usually reckon as a mini-fig set if not for the high price point. since there's a total of 5 mini-figs to be had, and at least 3 of them are going to be high sought after.(commander fox, clone trooper, battle droid commander). at first glance, it looked like there's only 3 packets. actually, it's a total of 4 packets, 1 of the packet is inside the biggest packet. it's not a very complex build. took me around 25min since i was playing around with the mini-figs more than i was building up the spider droid. though finally, here's the completed build-up. usually for lego products, what excites me are the vehicles, yet this set is the other way round. yes, the mini-figs are definitely the crowd-pleaser this time. on with the review. here's the close-ups of the droids in the following order, battle droid commander, battle droid, & super battle droid. there's not much to comment on the droids, except that the battle droids come with the new arm that's able to hold the blaster properly upright. the sbd is the same dude that can be found easily in the previous droid battlepack. and now the good part... clone troopers. and that's commander fox, and his trooper. i was quite mystified by the amount of accessories given to the clone troopers as per the instruction booklet, as there wasn't any indication of what they were... (commlink, grenades, sensor scope, range finder?!?) then it hit me... real hard. notice anything yet? yup, it's a night scope, and a range finder. that, plus the visor that's available to fox too. now, this is really a good time to start troop building for the clone wars. :twisted: here's the weaponary. of course, let not forget the main dude... fore: port: aft: starboard: the ssd looks very similar to the actual screenshots from aotc, though am still wondering what's that little translucent red piece for... a re-enactment. and a comparison. this set is really either a miss or a hit. for me, it's a hit, due to the mini-fig count, and the wide array of accessories. it's going to probably be a hit depending on the movie that's coming out this month, since we have commander fox here(i heard that c.fox hasbro figure is a target exclusive, meaning it's gonna be another highly sought after). this set is also stated to be a limited edition, and seeing as how it's only available so far in only 1 toys r us in sg, this just might not be available anymore after the movie starts. :d comments: this review was done immediately after the launch of the clone wars toys at the midnight launch on 26 july on a local starwars fan forum. and after having caught the movie only yesterday, i now only have this to say, "it's not part of the movie!?!". oh well, cmdr. fox probably will fair better once the tv series starts proper. then again, that less-than-one-minute cameo of him, i do find it unforgivable. this being the 2nd review available, i sincerely hope you guys enjoy it.

1 valentin, nice review! i was thinking of doing this review, and realised there were 3 reviews being done for this lovely set. i must admit this is an amazing set, after buying it in tru for sgd$49.90 (15% discount). i like the comparison of both spider droid even though one is not lego. thanks for doing this lovely review. it's enjoyable to read.

1 valentin, on sep 13 2008, 10:35 pm, said: thanks. keke, imagine the horror that gripe my heart to see the discounted price on the sg's toys 'r' us flyer about a month after its release into retail. anyway, looking forward to your other reviews too. hey valentin and white fang! glad to see fellow sgs here! more reviews pls....

-1 there's plenty of reviews in the review index. (pinned topic)

0 alakazam! the good wizard is the wisest minifig in all of legoland. he is a master of the wand and can see the future. with these abilities, he helps the knights predict where the trolls will strike next. because this set is not in stores in the u.s., i was luckily able to buy this set on my vacation to germany. it is interesting that it is a euro exclusive. 5614 the good wizard set info set name: 5614 the good wizard theme: castle released: 2008 price: eur 2.95-gbp 1.99 pieces: 16 minifigs: 1 the review unfortunately i don't have the box, because in got smushed in my suitcase on the plane, so needless to say, it was not in top condition... the manual the manual is an extremely small fold-out. but the image on the front is nice. on the back of the manual, there is a picture of some of the 2008 impulse sets. this is a nice feature. the parts for an impulse set this has a pretty good selection. a very nice owl, and an interesting clear ball piece. all built this set took me forever to build. i had to take numerous breaks as it was the toughest, longest build i have ever faced! for an impulse set, this actually looks pretty good. the owl perch is nice, also the crystal ball table. the wizard is a very nice fig, with great printing on the legs and hat, and i love his beard. brickshelf gallery the ratings price: 8/10 (not bad, but i feel that impulse sets are slightly overpriced) parts: 7/10 (impulse sets are focused around the minifig, but the parts in this set are pretty good) design: 7/10 (the crystal ball is a good idea, and the owl perch is simple but nice) playability: 6/10 (there is not much to play with here) build: 8/10 (as i said before, it took forever. really it took all of 1 minute) minifig: 10/10 (the wizard is fantastic) overall: 46/60 bricklink lego s@h brickset abracadabra, blades of four... you are now a dinosaur! summary for an impulse set, this is very nice. the wizard is an excellent fig, and getting an animal in a cheap set is always great. i would definitely recommend this set. thanks, and happy building!

0 good review for a simple set. while it does come with the basics for an impulse set, i just feel that it lacks something though i am not sure what. perhaps a printed magic scroll? i am still not a fan of the printed cap (especially the stars), but i do like the printed pants displaying his various goodies hanging from his belt. the plain torso is to be expected from a wizard minifig i suppose. overall, it's not a bad set but it certainly feels to be lacking something, imo.

1 thanks for the review. i love this impulse set, i bought two of them so i could make a wizard and his apprentice. i didn't have an owl either so an extra is pretty cool, and i like the trans globe piece. batbrick away!

0 kudos on a well presented and written review. i think the reason this set didn't release in us was because it didn't have any warnings about choking anywhere on the box, therefore no lawsuits in us for lego. cheers isc

-1 the next in my attempt to review every impulse set single handed theme: space, mission mars set name: alien jet set number: 5617 number of pieces: 21 figures:1 released: 2008 list price: 1.99 (gbp) $3.50 (usd) 2.99 (euro) 5617 peeron.com 5617 bricklink catalog 5617 shop at home as always we begin outside of the box it looks rather exciting at first glance. set that cost a lot more than this one. now for what?s inside. the contents of the box, the impulse sets never look that inspiring. now for the alien, i have to say i?m not impressed. i?m not a big space fan and i only bought this due to my impulse review challenge, but as the main point of the impulse sets is the alien is a little hard to build a good set round something with one point or articulation. it lacks what make lego minfigs so great their articulation. now for the space vehicle, as always with impulse a short and easy build ensues. took maybe 2 mins at the most. time to mount the alien in his craft. the craft looks a little wide for him. slightly better from this angle but still not winning any awards. i?m disappointed of the impulse sets i?ve reviewed so far this is clearly the weakest of them, but what really disappointing is the other seem so good and useful. the rating system figures: 3/10 (the alien is not a good minfig) parts 6/10 (some interesting parts but nothing that special.) fun fun fun 2/10 (i can?t think of anything to do with this set to be honest.) design 4/10 (poorly designed the box makes it look much better.) price 6/10 (despite the impulse price tag i?m still unhappy about the price.) grand total 21/50 (less than half marks the lowest i?ve given so far.) conclusion. in many ways i?m annoyed, from the outside of the box this set looks quite interesting and certainly appears to be well designed. the idea of a small alien fighter/flying craft is in my opinion a good one, but sadly when you?ve got the finished product in your hand it looks nothing like the box art. while i think mission mars had some interesting sets and i might still get some of them this one will not be a repeat purchase for me.

-1 im not a great communicator but what i was trying to say was that on the box the sets looks quite exciting and well made and that the alien fits much more snugly than it does. so i was a bit disappointed that it seemed wider and less compact and certainly less exciting when i opened it,

-1 well now we at least know that we can avoid that set ;) johan

-1 thanks for the review. considering the price, i give it "below average". i didn't buy any of the space impulse sets as i don't think they are good value.

-1 i already don't liked the aliens, but if the fighter was better i would already bought him. now i will maybe buy one of it just for the 2 limegreen pieces.

1 i rated this poor due to the fact the set is unimaginative (looks like a bunch of plates where thrown together) and it just isn't worth the money lego is asking for it, imo. i've never been a fan of the non-articulated "jellies" so i'll leave my disgust for them out of this post. however, unlike the set, the review is a fine work of art that clearly depicts the goods and provides valuable insight/opinions about the set's playability, usefulness, and overall value.

-1 impluse sets are made good by using parts well and minifigs. this has either. i give a low score. i really dislike the alien figs. worst lego fig ever.

1 sets we miss include minfig sets like this one?? theme: space set name: space mini-figs set number: 6703 number of pieces: 30 figures: 6 released: 1988 list price: ? (unknown) 6703 peeron.com 6703 bricklink catalog lets begin by admiring the outside of the box. wow 6 figs and all equipped, i was four more of these. we don?t get instructions so the back show how to put the figs together. now for the men themselves. the complete line up, of all six figs, it seems strange half are in black. a closer look at our four futrons. a look at the blacktrons looking like nice guys with their visors raised. time for a closer look at the range of tool these good men received from the lego company. yep one accessory per person. the question is what could you do with this set, i mean it?s just spacemen in a line? do you see the man who mugged you ma?am?. a good set from an age when we could look forward to every few years a new set of minfigs and just a box of them the rating system figures: 10/10 (an excellent selection for the time) parts 4/10 (good accessories but nothing else.) fun fun fun 7/10 (i can see lots of opportunity for fun with this set..) design 8/10 (well it?s not really designed much but it?s a great idea.) price ?/10 (unknown at this time though mine was from woolworths!) grand total 29/40 (a good mark for a great set.) conclusion. until the castle battle packs came out this year we?ve been suffering from a lack of minfig based sets, and from this review i think you can see why. for many of us and i include myself here lego minifig are one of the best parts of the hobby and sets like these allowed you to build up a much larger number of figs. lego did well with this set a nice range of figure and also a good selection of accessor

1 cardinal brick, on aug 30 2008, 06:23 pm, said: the question is what could you do with this set, i mean its just spacemen in a line? what could you do? the possibilities are endless!! 1. you can stand them in a line 2. stand them in a circle 3. stand them in a square 4. sit them all down 5. sit some of them down and leave some standing up (adult supervision may be necessary for tfols attempting this one) 6. take them all apart and scatter the pieces like some kind of huge space mine has gone off 7. yeah, ok. that's probably enough for now seriously, i love all the sets of minifigs from all the different themes and this is a great one. i always wanted them when i was a kid but never did. my focus always was on town sets (petrol stations and police sets please stand up) and there was never enough pocket money left over for space. sigh! you are so lucky to have this great set! thanks for sharing cheers rog

1 thanks for the review! the latter space mini-fig sets were great as they gave a nice variety of men. i'd love this one...

-1 thanks for sharing this review with us. i think this one of the sets. in europe this thing is waaaay overpriced and thus makes it a crappy set. we pay nearly double the us price. so i rated it poor. also because the figs included does not make it great. the hailfire is well designed and looks great, but that's just about all there is worthy of a positive mentioning. sorry. [on a side note: as a bronze-awarded student, where's the price in eur and gbp? and where's the poll?] [nevermind the poll, i've added that one for you ]

1 great review. i agree that this set is underrated. the hailfire is supposed to be a little taller than two battle droids, so scale-wise it's nice. the dwarf spider droid is amazing in my opinion. i just wish it wasn't brown, it makes me feel like it's on geonosis. we never saw a grey varient of the hailfire, so it's fine with me that it's brown.

1 this is a great set, i have 2 of them now, and i plan to get more. it is much better than the droid battle pack. for 10 bucks more, you get better battle droid arms and some canon "vehicles", good enough for me.

-1 thanks for the review. is a great one. this set is not really a good set but i like the spider droid. the hailfire droid scale is not right, i think it is suppose to be even bigger. anyway, this is the first set that re-release the commander droid. so i grab it.

0 this is a must have set for aotc fans and i really love the hailfire droid but it costs like $80 or more now that its discontinued.

) seal slapped on the front, although you won't have trouble finding this in your local toys "r" us, because of the big clone wars display in the front of the store that you can't miss. overview in this picture, you can see the contents of the whole set (minus the instruction booklet) built. you can spot five minifigures (which i'll get to later), and a very tall cis weapon, known as the homing spider droid. this weapon of destruction is a must-have for your cis army, although the color scheme (mostly dark bley and light bley) is a change up from the regular colors (brown or blue) of the cis. this may have something to do with the blended armies of the trade federation and corporate alliance, but i don't know for sure. the instruction manual is very thin, only about twenty pages. homing spider droid this is the main part of the set. four huge legs, two mounted guns, and a red sensor eye are the highlights of this artillery unit. there's not many playability factors to this one, but sometimes its just fun to squash the little clones, a change-up of the contrary. it also looks good next to all of the other cis sets, but you might want to clear some room in your display area; the legs take up a lot of room! this thing is also massively tall, about the same height as the republic cruiser. main body this is the main body of the spider, which has no cockpit and is remote controlled. this spherical body (not in that sort of way...) is a very quick build, and features a big, red eye connected by a red stud and hinge. top gun here is the top gun (not with tom cruise), which is connected to the body using a clever technic system (pun not intended). as you can see from this picture, you can see that it can rotate a full 360 degrees, but only if you remove the eye. also, the gun can be pulled back, and if you let go, it will snap back, like the a gun does when fired, due to the force of the shot. i'm not sure this was intended by tlg, because it wasn't showed anywhere on the box or in the manual. lower gun here is the gun attached to the under body of the main part. it is attached using a hinge, which allows it to move up and down. i also like the cord (that presumably transfers power) included on both guns. hips here is one of the hips attaching the legs to the body. there is one on each side, with two legs each. the are attached to the body and legs with technic pieces. legs you can see the tall legs in this pic. they are basically just technic poles and connectors. feet this is one of the feet, the essential to balancing the whole vehicle. these and the legs are repetitive, so i suggest doing them all at the same time to avoid flipping back in the manual and repeating the process three more times. the picture speaks for itself for the design of the feet. all are connected to the legs using a double-holed technic piece. one massive son of a gun this thing is so tall! it frightens the skin off of even the toughest, most experienced soldiers. run for your lives!! look at how much havoc and fear it causes! family photo enough of the battle scenes, here is a shot of this spider with it's smaller cousin: the dwarf spider droid. minifigs finally, here are the minifigs that come with this set. there are five in all, which include: battle droid: nothing special, but still an addition to your army commander battle droid: i love that yellow torso! super battle droid: again, nothing special clone trooper: i'm glad they gave us one in this set, i can add it to to my other phase 1 clones. commander fox: i love it! everything from the dark red markings to the accessories are fantastic! the head is just the regular anime style clone wars face. this set comes with two flashlights, two antennae, one visor, one pauldron, and one kama. close-up of fox here is a close-up of fox, so you can see the detailed insignia of the republic guard. that wraps it up for the review, here is the final verdict: build: 8/10, very easy and straightforward, a little repetitive with the legs. should take the seosoned builder around 20 minutes. playability: 6/10, not many play factors, but it's fun to just squash puny clones with this giant arachnid. swooshability: n/a minifigs: 10/10, you really can't ask for more in this sort of set! design: 8/10, not very sturdy, but it is altogether clever. price: 5/10, yes, it is limited edition, but pumping up the price fifteen dollars more than it should be is a little ridiculous. overall score: 8.5/10, an excellent set for display, although not very sturdy. minifigs are superb, but the price could be better. in the end, i would highly recommend this to any prequel trilogy fan looking to build up his/ her army. well, that's about it for this review, please feel free to leave your opinions!

1 kimt, on aug 30 2008, 05:27 pm, said: i just bought this set the other day and i must admit that it gets a "below average" from me. the price is not corresponding with what you get. which would be implied, had jim added the eur or gbp price in the info[hint hint ] the spider droid is flimsy at best. making it stand or even move without tumbling over is hard. also why the brown cylinders on the legs? keep the colourscheme clean, please. the figs are fine, except that i dislike the clone headgear and the fact that the helmets now have holes in the sides, allowing the flesh head to show within = goofy looking. i am soo replacing the clone heads with black ones. great review of an acceptable set aw, that's too bad, kimt. while i must admit it is flimsy, i still love this set. oh yeah, i added the other prices, thank you.

1 thank you for that good review, jimbutcher. i think that this is really a pretty interesting and original looking set. maybe its not very stable, but it owns some special 'war of the worlds' charm for sure...

1 thanks for the great review jimbutcher! this looks like a pretty decent set, i might get this if i find it on discount.

1 i love the look of this set it's the closest to getting a walking eye from the venture bros. as well as the droids and troopers :)

0 mass-manufactured and designed to withstand extreme amounts of punishment... it's an iron drone, and it's marching on its sentry! set data 7711: sentry year: 2006 theme: exo-force subtheme: robots pieces: 74 (+4 extra) <- both counting hinge control stick and its base as two separate pieces price: euro 7 circa, misb, including s/h, on ebay; rrp was euro 5 circa / 5 usd. probably 5 ukp. building time: 20/25 minutes (10 minutes building, the rest of the time placing stickers!) more info: brickset - peeron being 2006 my last dark year, i wasn't a big exoforce fan but they were ok. i tought 2007 models were better, and still think 2008 models are the best. that basically means 1) it's a shame that there will be no more of this line and 2) this is my first 2006 model, yet i bought in in july 2008. ok, let's do this one. box front: box was battered due to italian post; they'll do their best to give lego boxes a "war" outlook. close-up: the japanese katakana read "tokushu butai" -> special (military) force(s) box back: amazing alternate model; some like it more than the original design. box content: a small but capable sticker sheet, two bags and instructions. sticker sheet: and they're numbered! random instructions page: connecting legs to the body instructions page - sticker detail: that's why they're numbered. instructions page - parts inventory: does anybody check if they're all there before building? surely not me. loose pieces: nothing rare, i think; small techinc parts come in different colours, as usual (you often don't see them when the model is complete, but sometimes you do) the iron drone: "strong and durable" (and much better looking than those crappy mm jelly aliens) building starts. the open cockpit - front and rear view left leg - front and rear view; right leg is built of the same pieces. left arm - with laser cannon the cannon - great use of the hollow studs with the "plant tree palm top" right arm - with twin missiles complete model - front view complete model - side view and rear view rating and review. parts and building: nothing new, but both models are o.k. instead of waiting the last page of the manual, you'd better put the stickers in place while building. looking at the box you'd tell stickers background is (trans) purple. it actually is trans clear (excpet for the yellow and black stripes - warning: hazard!). try not to put your fingerprints on the sticky side! consider using tweezers. posability: both legs and both arms feature three joints; and that's good, so that the weight doesn't have the sentry falling down. final model: smaller compared to 2007 claw crusher and 2008 batlle arachnoid, but cheaper and surely worth the money. the "minifig" is just another iron drone, not much to say. final rating: 3,5/5 edited by sinner, 01 september 2008 - 02:22 am.

0 thanks for the review. i really do like the first year of ef. nowadays they mecha are perhaps more cleverly designed, and use ball joints for playability. but i really love the blocky bulky look of the first drone's machines. and somehow the older ones seem a better value of parts. i'm more inclined to buy duplicates of them than the newer models.

0 thanks for the review. this is one of the few first wave sets that i didn't get. i'm not really sure why as it wasn't too expensive.

0 this is polar-1, over... it's day 5 at arctic research base 76. we are experiencing radio difficulties since discovering a number of strange radioactive arctic life forms which seem to be effecting our signal, over. we have encountered a large polar bear which by all account appears to be friendly and playful. our food supply; however, has diminished quickly, and we have to venture north from the base to a frozen lake in search of fish. our cordinates are currently 4645?4?n, 74121?7?w. we do plan to take the snowmobile to the lake after we get our provisions in order. this is polar-1, out. polar explorer bonus pack set #: 6569 theme: arctic year released: 2000 piece count: 76 minifigs: 2 list price: $10 (usd) in 2000, lego introduced a new theme called arctic. it was something completely new and different for lego as no mini-fig scale sets and/or adventurers had ever ventured to the arctic. the set offered new orange pieces and combined elements of blue and white pieces to provide a number of sleds, vehicles, a mobile outpost (6520), and even a large polar base (6575). the theme was unfortunately short lived and did not see 2001. this particular set is a "value pack" that combines sets 6578 (polar explorer) and 6586 (polar scout) at a reasonable price of $10 (usd). i may have even paid a few dollars less at a discount toy store back in the early 2000s. a picture of the "bonus pack" with the two sets combined within the box: the backside features an advertisement for the lego club and pictures of other arctic sets: starting with the smaller set, the polar explorer (just a tip of the iceberg ): instructions front of box back of box both sets include the same minifig, an arctic fig with glasses and a thick arctic coat: here's a shot of the fig with his hood on. i always thought the hood is a nice piece that would work well for hoth rebel snow scenes. the set includes a few nice accessories: the set actually creates a small ice/snow formation that can even be placed on water to represent an iceberg: here's a close-up with the blue ice spider: the complete set: next, the polar scout: front of box back of box the polar scout instructions picture the same image as the box: but i really like the real arctic imagery on the backside: the set includes a small sheet of decals: included are some great arctic accessories: and some interesting arctic creatures, like this neon orange scorpion in a ball of ice: i love the polar bear, a great addition to snow scenes: but the best part of this set is the orange and black sled: the back sled attachment (u-haul) has some tools and a removable storage cover: the top comes off easy to store tools and equipment: here's the arctic fig with a great metal detector (or other snow research device): and the sled itself: lastly, a picture of the complete polar scout: final thoughts: i'm a little disappointed that arctic was a short-lived theme. at the time, i wasn't too interested in the arctic, but i still regret not buying the large polar research base after seeing it at a discounted price. i was able to pick up this set and the mobile outpost that i never opened. i'd be interesting in reading your thoughts in regard to this set and the arctic theme.

1 thank you for that fine review, thebrickster! i really like how this two small sets create an intense and adventurous atmosphere against the backdrop of a pretty exotic region. the setsre well designed and very nice with a fine amount of rather unique and well fitting gear. the whole theme offers a lot of playability in a set-up thats a little different to tlcs standard sceneries for sure. and... it always reminded me of 'who goes there?', too...

1 hi! great review on one of my favourite themes! i never realized how cool it was until just now, when you did your review. anyways, i remember my one set of the arctict expedition, the arctic expedition pack

-1 a nice set review. as for the theme itself, i though it was a very interesting theme. sadly i dont think lego put enough effort into it, i was personally upset not to se a second year even if i didnt buy any of the sets. it reminds me of the artic theme playmobil did at one point in the distant past to be honest. i think a number of good artic scenes were missed, when it came out a really wanted to get a ski plane but it never came, i built it myself in the end but i dont know how lego missed that one. on a slightly random note i do know that at least one lego minifig did make it all the way to the real artic with a research team, sadly i dont have any pictures to offer you.

0 4645?4?n, 74121?7?w??? those are some wierd coordinates.

1 thanks very much for this great review thebrickster! i love the arctic sub-theme, but unfortunately i never got my hands on any of the sets, since this theme had its time during my dark ages. this one is a really neat little set with a great amount of accesoires, especially these snow shoes and the backpack which i love

1 great review, i hope tlc does another. i rember reading a book once based on the theme which stated the scorpions and thespiders and such were aliens .

0 wasn't there some years back a film based on aliens in the arctic? can't remember the name and i think it was really old, but there certainly was going on something with strange creatures and a polar base

1 it's amazing! it's stupendous! it's almost like whitefang is a reviewer with previous experience! it's almost like i wrote all of shadow's lines! it's almost like staudie is being as annoying as ever. oh wait, that's all true! great review of a neat little set. i used mine as the air conditioning unit on the roof of my chinese restaurant. then some dork told me it didn't look believable or something. i liked it. um... so. great review! thanks for presenting it! i give you a and, let's just take a moment to get sentimental. a year ago, today, staudie had a lame idea: interview the members of eb. he flailed around with it for a few interviews, including the infamous one where hinck attention whored sinner into a corner and sinner were featured, reprising their roles from the whacker and the walrus. it was quite memorable, but then, a short time later, someone new joined the team, bringing it to a new level of polish and bad jokes. still, this tribute isn't dedicated to that genius of the written word, nay, it's dedicated to the whole staff, including the new guy who is still a secret so don't bother asking, i'm not telling! ha! i salute you, eb news, it's been a damn fine year! i hope i can survive another.

1 2872 witch and fireplace review theme: fright knights parts: 18 figs: 1 price: unknown (bricklink $5.00+) year: 1997 brickset peeron brickshelf bricklink ever wanted to turn into a animal, wanted to curse your enemy or just wanted to be rich beyond your wildest dreams. you should go visit the witch and her fireplace. she can brew you up a potion for any occasion or purpose. so head down to see the witch right now. although this set is from the fright knights theme it can easily fit in with any other castle theme due to the lack of specialised fright knight parts and printings. the set comes with no astounding parts but looks like the source for our good magician impulse set from the current castle theme. i think i got this as a promo set. official pic. the box art for the set has the standard fright knight background and lego system logo followed by the set number. down the left hand side of the box a cat is attempting a head stand. also i think this box display the contents of the set in an attractive set up as usual. 1. the whole set minifigs and all here is the witch. on the torso there is a spider amulet which is a little hard to make out due to the low res of the image. the witches wand is the same as the bellville fairy wands except in trans red like a lightsaber blade although it is completely useful as a lightsaber. as you have probably noticed the witch has no legs instead she has a slope brick with the dress pattern printed on witch (get it witch-which) looks better than asajj ventress' from the new clone wars sets in my opinon. (for this anyway) the fairysaber (new word) duel. this is the old run down fireplace of the witch. at the base there are two smouldering coals instead of fire witch (it's not funny any more is it?) doesn't make that much sense seeming as it is a fireplace. the little triangular brick on top doesn't really do anything i also accidentally put the wrong one on while building, it should be a sloping brick. here are the coals. the old trans orange studs are less translucent than the new ones. i like how they have places them above the main baseplate on a 1x2 plate so they are in line with the rest of the fire place other wise it would look wrong. here is everything else i haven't covered yet, the crystal ball, the pets and the magical potion vial. the crystal ball is identical to the one included with the good wizard impulse form the current castle theme. i like the molds for the cat and the bat although if the cat had some yellow printing for the eyes like the white cat had black for the eyes it would be much better. i think the trans green tube things are a little uncommon but i'm not worried about that. 2. overall build: 6/10 extremely puzzling and difficult do not attempt alone . it's pretty simple but seeming as it has a load of stuff you can move around it is good. minifigs: 9/10 i really like the witch and it couldn't have really come with anyone else also it came with the wand which is really good too. design: 8/10 it should have come with some fire and maybe some more orange bricks to put at the base. parts: 8/10 the minifigure isn't bad nor are the animals or the trans green part. price: 10/10 i am guessing this was pretty good. seeming as i think i got this as a promo i gave it 10 because it was free. playability: 7/10 as wth all impulse sets there isn't much here but at least it comes with some animals to have a fight with or give the witch rabies. overall: 8/10 if it came with some more stuff for the fire place and the cat was more detailed it would have scored higher but because this set can easily be intergrated with other castle sets it got a mighty 8. 3. mini comic ! hocus pocus magic shocus turn my pets into dinosaurs (not to catchy is it?) *poof* oh know i think i might drink my magical potion glug glug glug oh! my

1 i chose above average. it has a great minifigure.... i wish i had it....someday i will!

0 you already know how i feel about the review. as for the set, i'm not entirely sure. it's a fine witch, but you've already gotten her in the witch's windship and a few other sets. i vote average on this. a good minifig (though one does not have the need for more than one witch) and some fine additional parts.

1 yay, another fright knights review! odd comic at the end. skipper 24, on sep 1 2008, 07:05 pm, said: ever wanted to turn into a animal, wanted to curse your enemy or just wanted to be rich beyond your wildest dreams. you should go visit the witch and her fireplace. she can brew you up a potion for any occasion or purpose. so head down to see the witch right now. sounds like a song or nursery rhyme, somehow. anyway, to the review, it is a great review, such a small set but you've summed it up well. this is one of the few unpromo fright knight sets i didn't get, sadly. not 'sadly' because of willa the witch, i have about four of her, but the special cat, and the other bits (one can never have too many lego bats). i voted the set outstanding, i think it is for its size. kimt, on sep 1 2008, 08:16 pm, said: you already know how i feel about the review. good or bad feelings? edited by shoc, 02 september 2008 - 11:45 am.

1 thanks for the cool review! as for the set: a witch, a bat and a black cat!!! that's more than enough for such a small set!

0 thanks for the review skipper. i've added it to the review index

0 i voted "average" think the minifig and black cat are great.

1 kimt, on sep 30 2008, 12:55 am, said: you're damn right, that is strange why is this your favourite? please explain, i'd love to find that out haha! i wish i could. well, i like small sets, and this is, aside from the fright knight's flying machine, comes in the smallest lego box i have seen. i just like the look and story feel of the set. i wish lego put out more sets like this and the 3075 ninja master's boat.

0 ok, i see. actually they still make those small boxes. the duracell promotionals are released in them.

1 huzzah! the king has declared a royal tournament pitting the brave knight in his shining armour, against the feared skeleton warrior and his shadow horse. the jousting arena is set up so let the joust begin! 7009 the final joust set info set name: 7009 the final joust theme: castle released: 2007 price: usd 7.99-gbp 5.99-eur 7.95 pieces-62 minifigs: 2 figs 2 horses price per piece: about 13 cents let the games begin! box shots the front has an image of the knight and skeleton jousting with lightning in the background. the back show the two now fighting with an ax and ball and chain. i don't really like the box image, as i think the background looks too dark. manual the front has the same picture as on the box. on the back some of the other 2007 castle sets are displayed. this is better than the usual sweepstakes image that we get. the pieces nothing really special here. but you at least get a good assortment of weapons. shields i always like lego shields and these are no exception. the patterns are great. minifigs first the horses. these are great, the knight's horse's coverings are really nice. now, the minifigs. the knight and skeleton both have nice armor. the torsos are plain black for the skeleton and bley for the knight. the finished product in the middle is the jousting barrier which is simple, but serves its purpose. on the left we have the weapon rack which is good. it would have been nice if tlg had included a rack for the skeleton as well though. extra parts only two extra white parts here. you can use them if your knight's horse wants to retire and look like a normal horse again. oh! that has to hurt! it seems that the skellie has won this round! poor knight... brickshelf folder now, for the ratings! price: 7/10 (not a very good price per piece ratio, however at least 2 figs and 2 horses are included) parts: 7/10 (the shields and log bricks are nice, but most of the others are nothing spectacular) design: 8/10 (relatively well designed, but a bit boring) playability: 8/10 (you can joust with it and that's about all) build: 8/10 (short and easy) overall: 38/50 brickset lego s@h peeron bricklink strike! it seems that the horses have rebelled against their riders... summary this set although not amazing, is still a very solid set. the minifigs are great and so are the horses, but the rest of the set kind of feels like an afterthought. even with its negative aspects i still recommend it, especially if you are a castle fan. thanks, and happy building! p.s. if you want to see how i made this set a bit more fun, check out this click

1 nice review. i can tell that you put some effort into it. the moc is a nice design. your reviews are getting better and better!

1 outstanding. this is (as many of the new castle sets) a super set. you get loads of great parts, a horse barding, a black skeleton horse and for a fair price. i just love this set and i've bought quite a few of them to build my army. a "must have" - and your great review serves it well

0 jimbutcher, on sep 1 2008, 07:53 pm, said: the plate with the hole in it is for an easy grip when you push it around, i think. nice review by the way. i think the telephone piece is great, if a little bit over-sized. i never thought f that but i guess that's what it is for unless it is for a trailer.

1 this was an exellent review keep them coming. -ras-

1 nice review! keep up the good-reviewness work!

1 this was a great set for the price. ten dollars for a cool minifigure and a decent sized ship is great.

0 yeah this was an ok set. i remember getting a few of these at tru. the boxes were smashed up and i got some 30 percent off. (still not as cheap as regular us price ) some ok bricks and a great minifig. thanks for sharing your thoughts and opinions on this set i'll rate this set as average. oh, yeah i've added the review to the index.

1 is your knight army feeling short? do your knights get consistently run over by the skeletons? if so, this is the set for you! 852271 knights battle pack set info set name: 852271 knights battle pack theme: castle released: 2008 price: usd 12.99-gbp 6.49-eur 9.95 minifigs: 5 it's army building time! packaging the figs come in a plastic box with a slide out tray. to open, you slide out a tab on the bottom, and pull the tray out. the weapons one plus of this set is the good weapon selection. you get a whopping 5 shields, a spear, a lance, acrossbow, a pointed lance thing and a lovely chrome sword minifigures now the main focus of this set, the figs! one thing that's nice here is that you get a good selection of different knights. the figs are quite nice, with different faces and helmets for almost every one. minifig backsides! i really like the archer's quiver. two sided head the archer has a scared head on the other side. brickshelf folder and now, the ratings! price: 6/10 (certainly a bit overpriced. it should have been $10. the star wars battle packs have only 1 less fig plus some parts for $5 less) parts: 8/10 (no bricks, but a nice selection of weapons) minifigs 9/10 (the figs are great) overall: 23/30 lego s@h brickset bricklink even with a bigger army, the poor knights are no match for modern technology... summary even though the pack is a bit overpriced, it is still great for increasing your army's size. i would get this set if you are a castle fan looking to expand your army, otherwise don't worry if you pass on this set. thanks, and happy building!

1 very good review! i enjoyed reading this. i want to buy these battlepacks. until now, my country has not re-stocked these battlepacks. i wonder will they ever arrived again. i want to build massive armies with this outstanding battlepack set. hope it will arrived soon.

0 nice review, which reminds me i must order some more of these battle packs at some point. are you going to also review the skelton battlepack? also i hope this is a start of a running joke about castle sets being stomped by sw sets

1 great review of a neat way to bulk up your castle guards and their associated weapons and shields. i hope we continue to see sets like this in the future, they have to be a good money maker for tlg and they always please the fans. francis marion, on sep 2 2008, 10:39 am, said: they should have given him a horse ... with that lovely new barding. nobody would complain about the price then, even if it was $15.

0 great set, but with two huge cons. - availabilty: only on s@h? well, surely not in italian stores. - why are the figures already built? are today's kids so dumb? let's go back to those old minifig packs!

0 i've been thinking about buying this. i haven't bought any castle sets since kk2. plus i really need that scared face.

0 the cobra, on sep 2 2008, 11:33 am, said: - why are the figures already built? are today's kids so dumb? let's go back to those old minifig packs! probably to reduce the size/complexity of the package, thus, saving tlc money. i don't see it being a big deal as customization is always an option. concerning the set: not much to say other than it does what it's suppose to do: build up one's army of knights. the variance of faces and accessories are great. i especially love the chrome sword. the price isn't bad either since the package comes with five nice figs and some great equipment. edited by dj2005, 03 september 2008 - 06:46 am.

0 i was going to get this, but when i rang up s&h, apparently they'd sold out already. price is a little on the steep side as well, and i can only see it going up on sites such as amazon as the number of people wanting them goes up, which it will it it's anything based on the star wars battle packs.

1 and another great review from one of our academy teachers, i always look forward reading them ! i think the battlepacks for castle are a great initiative from tlc. i like this one, but also the one with the skellies, you get some different looking soldiers and a few weapons and shields, so that's cool. the low prices make it so that most people could build a large army/battle if they want to. a big for your review and another for tlc for making these. edited by zorro3999, 06 october 2008 - 05:40 pm.

0 i think this battle pack is a little expensive, but the minifig ,their heads and weapons and stuff are very very nice! but because of the price, i'll rate it " average" ^^

1 i love this set. i bought one when i went to the lego store at downtown disney, and went home and bought another online. i love that it gives you a variety of weapons and figures. i like using the bowl helmet guy to man my catapults and crossbows.

1 great review! i still don't plan on getting this set. i want to get more important stuff like the new medieval market... edited by lego12, 07 october 2008 - 12:19 am.

-1 it's way to expansive for what you get, besides you pay more for the package then its containts...

-1 i like your review on this battle pack. but i think that this battle pack was over priced. $12 for this? i am not paying that much for 5 knights.

0 dear all, i found this to be a very usefull army building set. at 2 euro per minifig it is relatively cheap in my book, so i bought 4 battle packs recently. although, it could be difficult to integrate all of them in your army. personally, i reshuffled some of the weapons as to integrate them better. but that is a personal preference ofcourse. kind regards, teddy

-1 yeah i have to admit, you expect it to be wayyy cheaper since: a. no packaging to pay for(baggies and such) b. no liscensing fees(like sw) so why isn't this set a better deal than sw battlepack? don't look at me, look at tlc(he he it rhymed)

1 today we will be joining mr. brickop and his dog stud on the tough job of being a police officer. let's join them now! 5612 police officer set info set name: 5612 police officer theme: city released: 2008 price: usd 3.49-gbp 1.99-eur 2.95 minifigs: 2 let's begin! the box a very nice small square box with the policeman and his dog on the front. and the back which shows the officer running to the scene of the crime, walkie-talkie in hand. instruction manual the back of the manual has the 2008 police sets and impulse sets pictured. it is interesting that the good wizard is on here even though i bought this set in the u.s. on this side you see how to build the model in 8 grueling steps... the parts not much out of the ordinary here except for the lovely printed road sign. minifigs here are the 2 figs, stud and mr. brickop! they make a great team don't they? extra parts this set comes with a surprisingly large amount of extras for such a small set. all built after it's all built, you get a pretty nice set. the road sign looks nice, but it is a bit strange seeing that arm stick so far out. the little equipment rack is pretty nice. brickshelf folder the ratings price: 8/10 (decent price, but could be 50 cents cheaper) parts: 8/10 (nothing special except for the road sign which is a big plus) minifigs: 10/10 (you can't wish for more than 2 in an impulse set!) overall: 26/30 lego s@h brickset bricklink mr. brickop has finally put legoland's most notorious criminal behind bars... summary this is a great impulse set. having 2 minifigs really sets it above some of the other ones. the set make a great gift, or a good cheap present to yourself. it is great if you need to expand your police force as well. i would definitely recommend it. thanks, and happy building!

1 good set, but i would have about 4 by now if it came with handcuffs though the roadsign is good.

1 i bought this set for 2,14 yesterday and i have to admit that for that price i'm veerryy satisfied ! i bought it especially for the dog (my first one) and for the road sign. during the construction (short!) of the set, i was wondering something... does the speed limit has a signification in every country or some variant exists? in my country (france), the speed limit in town is 50 km/h so i understand the road sign in this set. but in other country, and especially the country were the speed limit is not in km/h, does this set had another road sign?

0 not a bad set altough the radar is a little weird looking.

0 tanks for the review erdbeereis1 but i don't really need to buy this set since they're are always loads of police sets and it's not as if i need anymore cops, although stud makes it tempting...

0 set name: the knight set number: 5615 theme: castle pieces: 21 minifigs: 1 released: 2008 price: 1.99 eur, 3.49 usd, 3.49 cdn legoshop.com description: a knightly hero!villains beware, because here comes the knight! with his shining armor and weapons, he's ready to defend the castle against any foe. includes knight minifigure with armor, shield and weapons! peeron inventory bricklink inventory brickshelf gallery now to the review! the box the box is fairly standard and illustrates the set well. the back the back of the box is just an advertisement. the instructions the instructions are simplistic, basic, and short. the back of the instructions the back of the instructions show the other impulse sets, as well as a few others. the weapon rack this nifty little weapon rack holds the sword, the shield, as well as a different style helmet and armour plate. the minifigure the minifigure is of the standard castle variety, with the basic torso and helmet, and a slight scowl on his face. accessories/weapons the set comes with a shield, a spear, and a sword.i particularly like the pattern on the shield different configurations with the extra pieces of equipment i mentioned earlier, itis possible to turn your figure into something totally different... the entire set this picture shows the weapon rack and the knight, ready to ward off skeleton invaders! overall build: 9/10 the build is simplistic and suitable for all ages. design: 7/10 there really isnt much to judge in this category... playability: 8/10 with another minifig, plenty of exciting battles can be made! minifigs: 9/10 with plenty of customisation options, you can turn this one minifig into almost anything. price: 10/10 this set is well worth the price tag. overall:43/50 conclusion i really enjoy these impulse sets. for a casual lego-builder who doesn`t want to invest top dollar in lego, they are perfect, and for the hardcore fan, you could easily buy 5 or 6 of these to boost your army. this is the best impulse set of the first wave and i highly reccomend that you pick this set up soon, before they are all gone edited by kimt, 08 september 2008 - 08:03 pm.

1 thanks for this fine and elaborate review on the 2nd best impulse set there is. (yes the troll warrior wins by a zillion miles) i've added it to the index

0 i agree that this set is worth the price considering the amount of minifigs and even a skeletal horse. it also comes with a lot of blue 1x1 slopes that are always useful and quite rare to obtain. another weapon for the soldier operating the catapult (or a shield for the other soldier) would have been great, but that is pushing it. the crossbow itself is quite nice and is better than what most $6 sets come with, imo. overall, a good set indeed. thank you for the review and the other review concerning the knight, of which i hope to buy in the near future as it looks like it comes with a great deal of goodies. the weapon rack is useful, too.

1 thanks for the input!

0 i like this set mostly because it has some very usable pieces, but also because of the amount of minifigures in the set, which is a whopping three and one large animal (skeleton horse). the one thing, however, that i don't like about it, is that one of the catapult operators isn't armed. in my opinion, this would have been a good time for tlg to release a suitable dagger piece (not the kitchen knife) for its castle line. great review, by the way, it captured the key elements of this fantastic small set.

0 nice review, to start off. you got all the details someone could possibly need, in my opinion at least. i do enjoy this set as well, and i've bought only one to keep my minifigs as unique as possible. despite my personal preference, i still find this a nice army builder. good amount of minifigs for the price, as mentioned earlier, with each being different from the other. though i would like the catapult manager to be armed with at least something, i still feel that he can just flee if he's ever in trouble. he's a good guy to use for the castle gimmics if you have it. one more small comment. i also love those domed helmets, even if they aren't actually new. my favorite of them all, being followed up by the racer helmet.

0 nice review . i still thing sets like this are the reason castle has done so well, it allows you to collect a large number of minfig for not very much cash, which i certainly indulged in. my only complaint is that you end up with the evil skeletons out numbered, however heard of the good guys winning with the numbers in their favour.

1 dark times in lego castle land... the poor knight is being held prisoner in the skeletons' prison carriage. we must help the brave knight on horseback free him at once. let's ride! 7092 skeletons' prison carriage set info set name: 7092 skeletons' prison carriage theme: castle released: 2007 price: usd 19.99-gbp 14.99-eur 19.95 pieces: 193 minifigs: 5 animals: 4 price per piece: about 10 cents review time! box shots our first pic is the front of the box, which shows a dark image of the knight attemping to free the prisoner. and here is the back, showing some features. the manual the image on the manual is the same as on the box front. random manual shot no piece call-outs, but the color distinction is not a problem. the parts 193 pieces doesn't seem like a lot, but many of them are quite large. the selection is pretty good. lots of greys and black. minifigs with this set comes a whopping 5 minifigs which is amazing for a $20 set. the knights are very nice and one has a double-sided head. the horses adding to the already large minifig count are the 4 horses. 3 skeleton horses, and 1 great brown horse for the knight. extra parts now, the finished set! first, we have the brave knight on his brown stallion. the horse's head covering looks very nice. and the knight gets a nice long pointy stick. the main event, the prison carriage! the design of this is excellent. with the bionicle piece and the white horns, it looks very spooky. the tower this part is one of my favorites. it uses white horns to give it a great creepy look. one problem is that there is barely enough room for the 2 skeletons. the driver here you can see the driver and his whip. you can also see the bionicle spine. a side view when you look from the side, you can see the great design of the prison. it is placed on tiles for easy removal and looks great with the round white 1 x 1s on the corners. horses' harness this is another very well designed portion of the set. the harness attaches easily to the horses and to the carriage. the prison look at the poor imprisoned knight. let's try to free him! the back of the prison hinges down! the knight is freed! everything together all together, the set looks fantastic. the carriage has a great creepy skeleton feel, and getting 9 minifigs is amazing. brickshelf folder ratings price: 10/10 (193 pieces and 9 figs is fantastic for $20) parts: 9/10 (lots of good large pieces) design: 10/10 (captures the spooky skeleton look very well) playability: 8/10 (it's fun to try and free the prisoner and the carriage rolls well) build: 9/10 (easy but fun) minifigs: 10/10 (the sheer amount of figs is great and they look great) overall: 56/60 the future of lego castle... summary this is an amazing set for the price. a huge amout of minifigs, combined with a great design and good playabilty makes the set a winner. i would certainly recommend this set to anyone that remotely likes lego sets. thanks, and happy building!

1 nice review, it seems that you really covered all aspects of this fantastic set. my favorite part about it is probably the fact that you can give almost every included minifig a mount, except for one poor knight . however, another part i like is that the horse includes a plain saddle, which is a nice relief after the overabundance of the gold-plate barding, which is nice, but overused in the early sets. also, the sw jokes are hilarious! i particularly the running gag with the walker, but i like this one too. reason for edit: i made a mistake due to a loss of internet and an accidental post. edited by francis marion, 03 september 2008 - 03:32 am.

0 you're really rolling these reviews out, huh? i am not sure how i feel about this set. while it does include five figs, three are skeletons and are generally worth much less than say three trolls/orcs (i know they didn't exist at this point in time so this is understandable). the amount of horses is nice, but i'm not a big lego horse fan. what this set does have is a great appearance and brings atmosphere to the table. $20 is an affordable amount for those of us who do not wish to splurge too much on a toy while being enough to actually get a large enough set to create something out of. personally, i'd rate it in between average and above average. like another castle set (i can't remember which), i just feel this one also lacks something.

0 i really like this set, and it's probably my next purchase from a store (if i can still find it). there's alot of great pieces (i especially like the spiked thingy on the front), and it makes a great addition for any skeletal army. above all, i just love the spine-chilling feeling of it. if i were a minifig in a legoland, i'd be scared out of my pants-piece if i saw a carriage like that rolling towards me in a dark night.

1 well, indeed looks like a very nice set. especially the scared knights are very nice ;)

1 one of the best sets from the new castle theme. we havent seen a carriage in a long long time. and it looks so spooky and sceary! lots of minifigs new skeleton horses (3!) this was the first set i got from the new castle theme!! outstanding!

0 thats a nice review, though i do feel the price was a little high but as you said you get so much in it. last year argos in the uk reduced it to 7.99, which was a true bargain and sent me all over london looking for a store with more in stock. again as with all the lego castle sets i think what makes it work so well is that lego are now providing a much larger number of minfigs and thats often what makes a set.

1 thanks for the great review! i was going to buy this set this saturday and after reading this review, i am twice as likely to buy it!

1 that's a super review erdbeereis1, as usual and as we can expect from one of the academy teachers. i gave the set a 4 (above average) because i think there are quite some minifigs included for its price (which is, i think, not that expensive at all) i also like the parts that are included, like the sceleton horses and weapons, wheels,... imho this set is a great armybuilder ! btw: in belgium i have seen this set being sold for 15,99 euros.

-1 other than the minis, accessories and animals, this set is 'meh' at best.

1 i really do love this set. it has 5 figures, which is unheard of for a $20 set. it comes with plenty of weapons and accessories and has a great design. the detail is really well done and for anyone who wants to just buy one set, this set allows for hour of fun just by itself. i already have one of these, and hopefully will be getting a second.

0 this was my first set from the new line, so i'm rather partial to it. i'm glad to see it get such high praise. it's quite the lovely little halloween-y set. i wonder if thebrickster could modify this for his ww grave stone mocs? (hint, hint, hintedy, hint, hint. ) edited by pirates forever, 13 june 2009 - 02:02 am.

1 my first fantasy era set.. and now i have 5 of them.. really good set..

0 this set is alright but it doesnt have that pizzaz feeling you know what i mean. i would prefered a knights carrage realy but the design is ok.

1 i'm a little late in the coming (okay, a lot ), but regardless, i'd applaud you for another fantastic and insightful review, erdbeereis. out of all the castle sets, this one remains one of my favorites. i got it for christmas in 2007, before i intended to spend much money on the new castle theme (that changed once i managed to get the king's castle siege for a very good price). it's really a wonderful set all around - the design accomplishes the spooky undead feel very well, and it contains a good piece selection and a phenomenal amount of minifigs. seriously, this set is almost unrivaled in modern lego in the final area - i'm still amazed at how many minifigures tlc put in the kit. i also appreciate that the carriage has a far more realistic horse arangement - after all the sillyness of the one-horse pulled siege engines in kk, it's good to finally see a carriage pulled by multiple horses again. all in all, an excellent set, and well worth $20 imo.

1 great review! this is my 2nd favorite lego castle set (tied with skeleton tower) that i own. my first favorite is drawbridge deffense.

1 great review erdbeereis this is a cool set! pics are great! love that shot of the lightsabers! well done! commanderfox

0 7990 cement mixer theme: town released: 2007 price: 15 usd pieces: 209 (1 minifigure) introduction: need a skyscraper built? a mother-in-law buried? a treasure kept? no problem, here i come ! only one booklet for instructions without any alternative model: it's divided into two sections for two seperate baggies which the parts come in. parts come in two big bags: a few big pieces and the stickers are loose in the box. extra parts and sticker sheet: dark bluish gray 1x1 round plates are meant to be used as cement. sticker sheet is neat. a standard worker with helmet: he comes with a shovel. colour scheme makes it easy to understand the instructions: it's easy for younger lego enthusiasts to build the model. building in progress: chassis of the truck is really sturdy. drivers seat is on the left: i wish we had a real seat instead of a modified tile. working drum mechanism: you can turn the cement drum from a handle on the front right. nice details on the front: rearview mirrors are great. i love the snot front panel too. control panel on the left: cement hose hardly fits its place and the hose is too thick. don't forget the shovel: snot technique is used on the back panel as well. long & wide truck with 8 wheels: i love the 6-stud-wide design of new town series. cement drum actually works: if you place a couple of 1x1 plates in the drum and turn the handle it pours out the little cement parts! man at work: all this hard work gave me wrinkles on my face :( folder when public: brickshelf rating: -figures: 6/10 nothing special with the figure but what did i expect? at least we have a face expression. -parts: 6/10 standart parts for a truck but the big blue drum is new. -price: 8/10 very nice and detailed truck for 15 usd. -design: 9/10 it really does look great, doesn't it? -building: 8/10 easy to build and it's fun with a little use of snot. -total: 37/50 it's a must for every town. but other players should find it attractive as well. conclusion: i occasionally order town sets but i felt a great urge to build this when i first saw it on brickshelf. when it was released i ordered it right away. ten days later i was amazed looking at this beauty by my table. we didn't have a cement mixer for ages and i'm sure every town builder will have this set. and i have no doubt non-town enthusiasts, like me, will consider getting this. links: brickset reviews bricklink entry peeron inventory

1 thanks for the great review! this is one of my favorite city kits from 2007. i think it's a lot better than the cement mixer from the classic town theme - and it has some cool pieces too.

1 i voted outstanding, because i think this is the best cement mixer tlg ever made, also love the 6-stud wide based vehicles, as you mentioned. i both bought and sold it again this year, and i already regret it, but i had to sell some stuff because of a loss of space

1 a great review of a very good set, i must echo kimt though (i seem to be doing it an awful lot) it would be improved by the addition of one more fig to the set, as its the same price band as last years catapult.

1 nice review! i just recently purchased it for our future son and had to break into to it to get a first hand account of the merchandise! i am not that big into the castle theme...being a city/town person myself but i must say that this set is awsome!

1 i got this set last month and i can definitely say that even if you think it is one of the best sets ever, you won't fully appreciate it until you build it yourself. the elevated city station is much more complex than it looks, and the whole set is extremely detailed. the good: - as stated in the review, there's a lot of track, roughly twice as much as the last monorail made, 6991. 5 long straights too! - the designers didn't need to put in the hamburger stand or the ticket readers, but they did and made it even better - great figure selection; airport workers as well as civilians the bad (if you can call it that in such a great set): - hard to incorporate into an existing town if using the default track layout. the center loop would be inaccessible to vehicles and the layout is very large. - the monorail needs nearly a full straight section on either side of the city station or it will impact the corner of the station and stall if a curve is too close. - as far as i know the only town set with road plates that doesn't have a wheeled vehicle. a car would have been nice, a bus would have been incredible. but these small things in no way diminish from the fact that this is one of the best sets ever. edited by section8, 05 september 2008 - 01:17 pm.

1 best. set. ever. i got my copy years ago from a guy on the old rec.toys.lego newsgroup (anybody here still remember that newsgroup??). i traded him a guarded inn, a black falcon's fortress, and a couple other small castle sets for it. no regrets on that trade. it is hard to incorporate a monorail into a town, especially if you have a bunch of trains too! i ended up making my entire monorail system elevated. there's just no easy way to make a monorail / road crossing. i also gave up on having it run in a loop. instead, it runs back and forth between two endpoints.

1 an excellent review of one of the jewels in the crown of the lego town range, to answer one of your question i think the lack of people owning this set is one of the reasons that its yet to have a review. personally ive only seen this set in the flesh once in my life when i was a child just before it was withdrawn from sale. it is a lovely set, well made and well produced though i think there is a flaw and thats when the passages get of the other end of their train ride what picks them up, a bus set for the airport would have been a good addition. apart from that i cant really fault it and that fact it comes with three female minifigs is just stellar. as for incorporation, keeping it elevated seems the most sensible suggestion. ive always thought it i have it and wanted to integrate the set to a town to use it in the style of the dlr in london, but thats just a thought.

1 thanks for that splendid review, simonwillems! i clicked on "outstanding," of course! i also like those little details, especially the ticket validating machines. you're very fortunate to own this wonderful set! i hope you have an airport to go with it. edit: and bricklink is wrong giving 1991 as the release date. you're right; it was 1990. edited by legotrainfan, 05 september 2008 - 06:57 pm.

1 *gasp* blasphemy! someone voted this set "below average". *brings out hunting rifle* ahem, back on topic; i remember wanting this set badly, for years. and i still want it, just no as much, because it's expensive and, as this review proves, takes up a lot of room. i've already got my trains to think about, and i won't be getting this set anytime soon. i also have a faint memory of this set being featured in one of lego's advertisements, more specifically someone narrowly missing it, hitches a ride, races the monorail to the airport and catches the plane. i am yet to find it on the net, as old lego adverts are hard to come by, especially the european ones. now, to more important matters... *starts hunting* edited by freddie, 07 september 2008 - 10:03 pm.

1 what an amazing set and a truly wonderful review! thanks simonwillems for the work you spend on this.

1 good review, who voted this below average??? i own one and managed to pick it up off ebay a few years ago now with the track expansion pack for 150, in very good condition so glad i did, an all time classic

-1 judging from videos i've seen it seems that the monorail does very well on slopes. i wonder why there haven't been more or at least an updated set? i also wonder why the trains can't incorporate some slopes like the monorail.

1 indexed name: refuse collection truck set no.: 6693 theme: lego system / town year: 1987 pieces: 103 minifigs: 2 price: unknown special parts: 4215ap08 (yellow panel 1 x 4 x 3 with recycling pattern), just occurs in this set (2x). 4598 (red bracket 2 x 3 - 2 x 2), occurs only in this set and only one other set. this truck was introduced in the same year that lego came up with the garbage bins that of course also appear in this set. have you ever wondered why most of the time the streets of lego city are so clean and neat? no litter, no garbage everywhere, no chewinggum on the streets. even with so many different inhabitants, it seems to always stay that way. however, the older afols amongst us, have experienced totally different situations: rubbish everywhere, smelly and dirty looking pavements, minifigs that were losing their standard grin. that is why lego came out with this magnificent truck back in 1987. before that, people needed to put there garbage in bags or maybe barrels. from that year on, every miniman and miniwoman is happily using a trash bin. the minifig civil servants never seem to become tired and the garbage truck comes every other day to collect the rubbish and keep the city clean. the secret behind the clean lego city and the always happy 'standard grin' of our minifolks are the anti-litter warriors that use their powerful machines and handy tools to just get the job done! so if you don't own a garbage truck, better try to get one, before your standard grins also fade and your streets become as dirty as naples (where the garbage collectors recently had a strike for quite some time). an overview of the set including instructions (actually one is included in the set). unfortunately i afraid we don't have any boxes of this set left. another image of the lego items in the set. it shows the truck, two civil servants to perform the waste collection duties, two garbage bins and a broom and shovel. the two chaps that always seem to smile, even when the litter that they collect really stinks. the accessories that accompany the set. a broom and a shovel to help cleaning up in case a dustbin tips over. a very nice feature of the set is that the elevator at the back can be lifted in more or less the same way that real garbage trucks do. as you can see here, the dustbin is emptied through a red 'train window'. (it seems to be that the hinges of my version will need some 'revision'.) panels inside the back of the truck maximize waste capacity for this 4 stud wide truck. it is nice that the designers added this simple red round brick on a clip. presumably it should depict cylinders to let the back compartment tip for emptying or otherwise it might be gastanks. again the complete set. it is very complete set but some additions could make it even more playable: - garbage (e.g. a green flower bottom or some round plates 1 x 1) - a place for the second worker to position himself on, when the trucks needs to drive to the dumpsite or an other street and also vertical bars for that second worker to hold himself by. this is what the truck will look like when dumping the litter at the recycle plant or dump site, the whole back nicely tilts, so that all the litter will fall out of the truck. a view on the back of the truck. quite a small but yet effective opening. the front of the truck. only one seat for just the driver, but i personally prefer that to a 6 wide truck that fills the total width of the streets and has problems with corners. of course set 7991 (the orange garbage truck of last year) is also nice, we also own some of those but we never put them in our lego town since they take too much room and the color scheme of 6693 is also more preferable to us. the two panels with the printed recycling pattern are a bit worn so we might recreate the recycle logo and put it on a sticker some day. playability: 8/10 (like i mentioned it is too bad that the set doesn't have any litter [however lego also saw that and has put litter in the 6693 set]) design: 9/10 (a really nice truck with two minifigs and very nice details) price: -/10 (i was not able to get any price information, at bricklink one can still obtain a 2nd hand one for about 25$.) overall: 8/10 (a set that should be entitled a 'classic' in the same list as the pizza restaurants, the 7750 and the blacksmith shop) that was all the pictures i was allowed to take since it seems that those brave man still have quite some trash cans to empty. thanks guys for doing the dirty work so our minifigs stay happy and our streets stay clean! peeron lugnet brickset: bricklink entries additional notes on the review: my brother has always been keen on garbage trucks. however when he became aware of this truck it wasn't available in the stores anymore. newer sets that had the 'recycling theme' we not that good. they didn't have the emptying mechanism. so after our dark ages, one of the first sets we bought, were some of those nice refuse collection trucks. although the new orange truck has the desired mechanisms and thankfully is a decent garbage truck, we more like 4 wide trucks than 6 studs wide trucks, so for the years to come our lego town inhabitants will still be seeing this great truck to control their waste problems.

0 it would be cool to see a review comparing this set with the newer orange garbage truck.

1 definitely the best garbage truck ever, the color scheme is great and the design is awesome. outstanding, without a doubt. i must have it sometime

1 yeah its very nice along with all the older sets. i've got the cement mixer that was released around about the same time as this.

1 thanks so much for the great review, i love that truck! i hadn't realized there was a real 4-wide recycle truck out there. i must get it one day to replace this abomination currently doing garbage duty in my town: i think that truck has seven pieces total in it. i do like the blue color though ...

1 tenorikuma, on sep 7 2008, 08:30 am, said: it would be cool to see a review comparing this set with the newer orange garbage truck. true, woold be good for the people that have few new city sets like me, and your review is good btw! i own this set however, because it was really cool those days, nowadays all trucks nd cars can do neat things, but that wasnt so back then.

1 greetings! just looking through the review index when i came across this one. i recently acquired this set through ebay which came with a practically perfect box and instructions. i would almost say that no one played with it much as all of the parts were brand new. anyway, i just wanted to say that this is a great set that was worth the $14.99!

1 great to find this review of a classic set and it's far better than any yuk set from 1997 omg what were they thinking ! i prefer the six wide for trucks, but for the 80's it was perfect and even today still holds it's own !

1 great review, and i love the soft yellow effect to the pics imo, the most recent garbage truck should've used the same piece for lifting the cans into the big bin instead of the droid arms

1 i did not see this! nice review and beautiful truck. i like it!

0 6206: tie interceptor number of pieces: 212 number of minifigs: 1 price: 19.99 usd/ 17.99 eur/ theme: star wars: episode vi year released: 2006 brickset folder bricklink catalog welcome to my ninth review the boards, today's review is the long awaited tie interceptor. but does it live up to expectations? well, let's find out. i believe this is the first and only time tlg made this set. so, let's begin the review. the box the box is standard for it's time, with silver font. the background on the front has some planets and the death star ii, clarifying that this set is from episode vi. overview this set comes with the interceptor model and one fig. the interceptor has a very sleek, futuristic design, with four wings and a ball-shaped cockpit. the tie interceptor is a stealthy, speedy vehicle in the imperial fleet. it is used for scouting missions, and not meant for attacking due to it's weak structure and low arsenal. front this version of the tie group is very attractive and cool-looking. it has an aerodynamic shape, giving it looks and speed. while not accurate to the movie's grey and black colored ties, the blue in place of the grey is just fine, and does not alter the "coolness" of the design. thankfully, there are no stickers in this set. cockpit here you can see the ball-shaped cockpit. be very, very careful when opening it; it's very flimsy and breaks off almost every time. fortunately, both the windshield and the dish on top are printed, and not stickers. please don't mind the dust. cockpit interior this is the inside of the cockpit. it is very roomy, airtight, and one of the few cockpits in sw sets that are this good. it makes up for lack of detail by giving the pilot plenty of room, so you should have no trouble there. it is also very smooth in the back and where the windshield folds down. this is by far the best sw cockpit i have ever seen done by tlg, good job! the only bad thing is the two tan bricks that clash with the rest of the color. wing attachment this is how the wings are attached to the cockpit on each side. unfortunately, the design on this part is not so good, and sometimes the wings break off. plus, this part is very blocky, and there is a big juniorized piece on the base of the wings. wings here is what each wing looks like. there are three parts on each wing: a middle and two fins. the wings are very aerodynamic, with a diamond-like design. note the imperial insignias and the blue tiles lining the wings. wing attachments cont'd here, again, you see how the middle wing part is attached to the base (juniorized piece), and the fins attached to the base by hinges. the hinges allow the fins to fold in and out a bit, but again, this is very fragile, and the fins often break off. gun placements this is an example of four guns on the ship, one on the tip of each fin. the guns consist of a tile with a tenic tunnel hole on the bottom attached to a technic pin, which is attached to a black bar. a good design altogether. back here you see the rear of the cockpit. you can see why the opening mechanism is so flimsy: the whole top and front is connected to the body only by a weak hinge system, as seen in the picture. also note the small, trans-blue dish and the four trans-red studs. minifigure finally, here is the single figure that comes in this set, a tie pilot. it is an all black figure, with a life support system decal on the front and a helmet with silver imperial insignias. an overall good minifig, with a different helmet mold than the stormtrooper or shadowtrooper. well, i suppose that's about all, let's get to the final verdict: build: 6/10, a little difficult due the flimsiness of the ship, but should only take the average builder no more than 30 minutes. playability: 7/10, it's fun to fly around ( ), but has no real functions. swooshability: 7/10, you can swoosh it around fairly well, just be careful not to accidentally break it. minifigs: 8/10, a good fig, although having only one leaves something more to be desired. design: 4/10, very, very flimsy with the wings, windshield, and fins, but good for display. price: 7/10: i think it was actually 30 usd when i got it, but i'm not sure... overall score: 6.5, an average set. very delicate, so much that you can hardly pick it up, but good for display. the minifig is okay, and having no stickers is good. i would recommend this to a hardcore ot fan. that wraps it all up, please vote your opinion on this set in the poll, and i'll see you next review! edited by jimbutcher, 15 september 2008 - 03:10 am.

1 the interceptor is my favorite tie ship so i wish i picked it up. thanks for the review, i agree about the helmet, needs some silver printing on the mouth piece and the ends

1 name: jetport fire squad set no.: 6440 theme: lego system / town year: 1991 pieces: 84 minifigs: 2 price: usd 27.50$ (which equals about eur 19,26 and gbp 15,57) introduction: one of the sets that especially my cousin likes is this one. one time at the dutch legoworld event we had three of those there with flashing lights and loud sirens trying to put out the fire that was caused by the crash of again some lego aircraft. we never had this set before our drak ages and the sets probably came from ebay or so. in my opinion the newest airport rescue is nice too but in the conclusion i will make some additional remarks about that. just imagine what it would be like for your lego town if the pilot of one of your smaller planes, just couldn't stop before the end of the runway. here you see the disaster that happened some day in our town: fortunately all passengers got out safely thanks to our brave fire fighters. this magnificent truck was used to help putting out the fierce fire caused by the aviation gas from the small plane. the set includes two firefighters in distinguishable airport uniforms. in order to be able to safe the passengers and go for a quick intervention, our brave firemen have an axe for each of them, airtanks and a portable fire extinguisher. here you see the truck on the right side. the large spout on the roof really makes it a remarkable truck. as you can see, behind the red door, there is space for the airtank of our brave firemen, at the right there is also place for the small hand held extinguisher. the left side of the truck has a water hose instead. for a truck from 1991 there is quite some room inside. actually both firemen fit inside. unfortunately there is only one seat. at the back there are two clips for the axes. there you can also find the main switch for the light and sound system. as you can see, the red flashing lights, do their job quite well. the sirene is just behind the bar with the flashing lights. the main spout just seems to begin emitting water. the front of the truck. for some reason there are two hidden spouts there as well. what their purpose is seems unclear but they look nice. kimt suggests that it is for foaming the runway and that is a real option of course. this set can be found on: peeron lugnet brickset bricklink entries playability: 8/10 (very nice set, details that are movable and of course the light and sound) design: 8/10 (nice sets with nice details, but could have even been better: seat for 2nd fireman missing, no oxigen masks and only one airtank) price: 7/10 (for a light and sound set and two firefighters, the price is reasonable i would say.) overall: 8/10 (nice sets, some details could even be better, too bad that there is only a five to choose from a sticker when you have more than one truck) last but not least an overview of the complete set including instructions. "fire mastered" as the dutch firefighters will say when they have completed their job. we have also bought the newer airport rescue truck (7891). however we think this 6440 one is much better. the light and sound, all the nice features and the nice details are much better than the new truck. edited by jopiek, 11 september 2008 - 10:25 am.

0 i owned it and loved it when i was young ^^ i really miss it.

1 whitefang, on sep 7 2008, 05:09 pm, said: jopiek, i enjoyed this review very much! your first picture, certainly capture the essence of this lovely set. in reality, i am in the aviation line, especially aviation safety. therefore, you re-entact the scene very well. to be honest, i have never seen this set before. this aes (airport emergency service) fire truck is certainly unbelievable. i love it very much. it's a pity i never owned this. this is a set which give me a "5". thanks of course for the flattery but, do you then from your profession understand what the purpose is of the front 'spouts' that even can be hide, since that puzzles me. it can be that the lego designers thought it was a nice touch and didn't bothered about the realistic value of such a feature but i don't suppose that that is the case here.

0 perfect perhaps the front sprouses are for foaming the runway? you've certainly kept that set in near mint condition, haven't you? now all we can wish for is a new firetruck combining this l&s version and the new

1 i remember my cousins having this set. both are in their permanent dark ages now but are not willing to give their lego to me if you have one of those old airports, then this set is what you need to have even more fun since it makes a great addition to the airport. excellent review! 10/10.

0 sometimes there's no need for a big ambulance; sometimes you only need a doctor to get there. fast! set data 7902: doctor's car year: 2006 theme: city subtheme: emergency pieces: 66 (3 extra) price: 6 usd / eur / 4 ukp (uk price may have been higher in the past) building time: less than 10 minutes more info: brickset - peeron box front: no frills, just the set. box back: no alternate models, but "designed for easy building and istant play". i still wonder if today's kids are lazier or dumber than my generation... box content: 2 bags, loose car base, instructions, stickers. (not so) random manual page: the evolution of snot tecnique on car lights. set inventory: split into 2 pages! stickers: red cross has gone a long time ago; here's caduceus. loose pieces: we're ready to start! minifig and accessories: "what's up, doc?" m.i.p. (most interesting piece): it's snot time! building starts: and it's fast and easy notes: car has doors! and that black plate with rail helps so that the roof doesn't only weight on the windscreen. complete model: top view "container cupboards": that's where doc puts its accessories when driving. sticker time: see the difference, with and without. review and rating. do you remember when lego cars had doors? it seems so long ago... the car is simple; but as well as a set can be designed, this one doesn't look so realistic (isn't it what lego has been doing over the last few years? going realistic?) doc is ok, but i guess many people would have wanted a female fig (and: brown eyebrows with black hair? that's odd ) as i said, no red cross, but a politically correct caduceus on the roof and sides. extra pieces: 1 small antenna and 1 1x1 decorated tile. overall, a cheap way to own a doctor minifig and a nice vehicle to add to your town. just above average. rating: 3.5/5

1 i was going to get this, but instead i got someting else (firetruck i think) nice review!

1 nice review cobra. thanks for sharing. i esp. like the doctor's torso. i rate this little set a 4 based on the design of the vehicle and the classic doors. blogged! edit: i must have missed this review after it was posted back in sep. i went ahead and kept the blog, since it's always enjoyable to look at these reviews.

0 name: cargomaster crane set no.: 6352 @ peeron.com theme: lego system / town year: 1991 pieces: 133 minifigs: 1 price: usd $26.00 / gbp unknown / eur 19,95 aargh stupid tree! for more than fourty years this 'megabrick' has tormented our town! we need some help! long before my dark ages lego released this relatively small set. since they didn't have a construction site like nowadays, they released these small road-works. i was only six years old and really into small sets since my adhd didn't allow me to sit and build for long periods of time. so these smaller sets were ideal for me. the instruction booklet. the complete set. the set itself is not really a surprise to set up and play with. first you'll build the smaller parts of the set like the container and the small verhicle. no real surprises there, except for the smaller car that fits perfectly in the cargo container. just pull off the seat and steering wheel, and the car just fits. the crane itself is just as easy to build as the smaller parts. just place bricks on top of eachother. although you'll still have the wire to connect and pull through a diversity of bricks and plates. the carco container and small car. being out of my dark ages really tunnelled my vision toward bigger sets and completing my town. this set really comes in handy if i need construction or traffic workers in my town, i can just moc a few containers for tearing down trees, fixing traffic lights, and so on. behold the mighty cargomaster crane! it's pretty easy to say that a set as simplistic as this one is not much fun to play with. however if you see the bigger potential in your town this one could be of great value to any city. playability: 7/10 (with only one container it gets a bit boring) design: 9/10 (it's small, and fits perfectly) price: 7/10 (average, but not really cheap.) overall: 7.7/10 (a nice overall set if you're building on minifig scale) gimme my pizza! every town should have a pizzaria! more information: bricklink search results brickset lugnet edited by crazydance, 07 september 2008 - 03:52 pm.

1 information name: fire control center set no.: 4953 @ peeron.com theme: lego, legoland year: 1991 pieces: 516 minifigs: 4 price: usd $85.00 / gbp unknown / eur unknown bricklink search results brickset lugnet introduction this week i got the flu. so since i have to stay home and get better, i might as well make a review. it's one of the most amazing older city sets, thus making it a really valuable review. this is the story about four handsome firemen living in one of the most amazing city structures out there. the 6389 fire control center. the box i actually didn't remember the box to be that small. (borrowed from peeron) the four hunky firemen oh jeah what women doesn't like a man in a uniform the manual even the manual is aging... but then again it's 17 years old! review as you all know a city must have some standard civil services, like a hospital and a police station. a fire house also is a must for any lego city. this particular fire house is one of the most amazing sets ever to be released. in this cool set you get 4 minifigs, all fire fighters, two verhicles, and a helicopter firefighters have to move around the futuristic fire truck is definately my favourite! chief's car the smallest verhicle of the set, it's a small all-terrain jeep for the fire chief. pretty much a standard car in those days. a real simple layout, and a trunk which holds a small fire hose. it's lucky to be in this set, because it complements the whole thing the car luckily it's red and it has de cool signs on the side. helicopter another great addition to the whole set is the helicopter. again in a basic setup for that kind of verhicle at the time. this one has the nice addition of two hoses to put out the fires raging in lego city. the chopper no, it doesn't really fly really cool fire truck thingy this fire truck is definately the best of the verhicles in this set. it's actually a futuristic model of fire trucks. i haven't seen any other fire truck like this. i saw a police truck like it though. but we're talking fire fighters right? actually the whole thing han open up to reveal a number of fire fighting appliances such as a hose, a computer, and a oxygen tank. the fire truck click for bigger version! the main building actually looks kinda empty when the trucks and chopper are gone. however, this still is realistic compared to a real fire house. also the front has those amazing sliding doors, which make this thing really look cool and clean. off to fight a fire main structure, with the slinding doors pulled down actually those sliding doors are also the hard part of the model. since all the bricks must be perfectly aligned, or else the doors will stutter. but if you're a little familiar with lego then you don't need to worry. from the back enough room to play with i'm going to give my perspectives on each of the sides on the left we have the garage for the bigger fire truck. the only real flaw about this set is that this garage isn't long enough for the fire truck. this could have been solved by making it two or three studs longer. notice the cool sunroof! in the middle we have the chief's office. complete with coffee machine, a diversity of computers, and a tape recorder, most likely to tape any incoming calls. a lot of details are crammed up in there. just like in the rest of the set. to the right is the helicopter platform. i really like the grey-blue-yellow of the platform because it doesn't look so red anymore. don't get me wrong, red is a cool color, but not too much red! and the helicopter actually fits, and stays in place during playtime. the baseplate filled up this picture says it all. again the four lego hunks are greeting all the ladies the minifigs are from a classic series, this happens with more of my lego sets. bottom line is that this set is one of the best fire houses lego created. verdict the build is pretty easy but takes a while to really see where you are with your building. it's nice to have a hospital from the same era, this create a more uniform look to your city. once you completed the model your baseplate is pretty filled up but still has a lot of opportunities. playability: 10/10 (cool trucks, a chopper, and sliding doors, nuff said!) design: 9/10 (insanely good design) price: 10/10 (couldn't get better than this) overall: 9.6/10 with a score like that one can only say... get one... now! time to go home the trucks and chopper back on their rightful spots

0 i have this one. the newer 6571 station is better in some ways, but i always liked the big airport-style fire engine in this and the windows covering the garages. one mod project i have in mind is to expand the base, adding a second room in the area beneath the control center. interestingly, this set had two different box pictures. there was the original 1989 yellow legoland box and a 1991 blue system box, and the blue box has the vehicles in different places. quote price: usd $85.00 / gbp unknown / eur unknown if this is referring to the original price, it wasn't that much. $50 is more like it.

0 this set looks real nice, but a wall in the middle with a stair and a few desks/containers.

1 big supie, on sep 7 2008, 08:46 pm, said: i think the 6382 fire station is the better one from the 80ies. i have 6382 and agree that it is a great set. it doesn't have a chopper like this set and the fire engine is not as flash. it does have a downstairs in the building though (at least a door and a front wall anyway!). it's nice to see a review of this set as it's one that i often looked at in the catalogue and thought of getting but never did. it's great to see the details that i otherwise would not have seen. i don't like the firemen with hair though! they should have helmets or caps imho! thanks for the review! cheers rog

1 from memory argos sold it originally for about 21 gbp. i seem to remember this as i could not afford the airport released the same year as this was about 29.99! seems such a small amount of money now, now have 2 copies of this set, only 1 boxed :-)

1 cp5670, on sep 7 2008, 05:25 pm, said: nice classic set. are those hoses around the engine pneumatic tubes? that technic catalog looks interesting too. i have the catalogs for the next several years but not that one. the most extreme example of this was the engine step in the 8865 set, which uses over 120 pieces by itself. the pneumatic tubes are listed seperately under x188. the classic hose is x467. i think they're just the same with just a single difference: the x467 seemed to be already cut in lenght instead of x188 which must be cut in lenght. mfg widdi

1 great review! i really love the seat and the great possibilities with the alternate models. also congratulations for getting that set in perfect condition!

1 a very nice review, jopiek! you know, i was wondering how lego could justify having two 12v-powered passenger trains at the same time, but after reading the review, and seeing the lack of figures and accessories, i guess i understand why (plus the train is rather compact). oh, and i can't help but think that the chairs in the middle carriage are somewhat oddly placed, because those placed next to the door are unusable because the door takes up room needed for figs' arms. also, it appears that your set also has the newer couplers, i.e. there's no hooks for the decoupling rail to grab hold of. with the light assembly it really won't matter, play-wise, or if you don't have any decouplers, but it's still a bit of a bummer.

1 a great review for a great set. thanks for sharing it with us. a like the older lego trains. btw i think you need to fix this: quote name: jetport fire squad (light and sound series)

1 a set from the "golden age of lego". it brings back a lot childhood memories seeing this review. i was 5 and just starting to play with lego around that time. i could look for hours the lego catalogs dreaming of sets like this one. thanks for this wonderful review!

1 the best 12v legotrain is for me the 7740. the 7725 is still a goodlooking train and the only one with short wagons in a electric version. before i started to with bricklink, i started to build this train in blue. i've build 4 trains of it and sold 2 of them. still one for sale . you can also build this in other colors, like a yellow one: or you can build a black version, which i made a death train of it. driven by a skeleton . edited by panda9001100, 17 may 2009 - 08:01 am.

0 i fixed the images, but indeed, the topic is quite old already.

1 great review! i would buy the sets, but sadly tlc doesn't sell them anymore. i have one question only: how can you be reviewing at this time at night!?! i would never dream of doing that! well i can't wait to see the other reviews!

0 i had never seen these sets before in my retail stores before. however, i do remember the existence of its video games. look like an interesting set for great outdoor enterainment and fun for lego citizens whom is out for real thrill and excitement. this theme never really got me excited back then. after reading your review, it's quite useful for some new addition to your town features, such as including a skater boy, holding the pizza instead of using the pizza van. the high fuel cost must have caught up to them, to resort using skate board for delivery. as for the street surfer vehicle, it's a cool looking vehicle with unique construction. pardon me, i have not seen such design before. i will actually tear off the wheels, cover up the sides and used it for wind surfing! that's the whole idea. after giving some thoughts and weighs its factors, i will have to give it a "3" for this set. i will probably get it if its on sales. once again, brickster this is a lovely review which has showed us a new perspective of island xtreme stunts.

1 like whitefang i too only remember this line in computer game form. i used to love that game! i actually have never seen a review for an xtreme stunts set, so this was nice to see. as for the set, i think it looks pretty good. i really like the hippie guy. the windboard thing is nice as well, but looks a bit strange somehow. i give this set a solid 3 out of 5. thanks for the nice review! edited by erdbeereis1, 08 september 2008 - 04:05 am.

0 nice review. i got this set not long after my ending of the dark ages. it was even then already on slae for just 5 euro. i like the figs and the vehicles. it were some of my first orange pieces. the hippie guy is called " snap lockit" and the pizza guy is called " pepper roni". i think the legodesigners had a cosy evening with much beer when they thought about the names. i think this line was the only line which was made first as computergame and after that as a real line instead of the other computergames based on already existing lines.

-1 her name was sky lane. it's quite sad, though, to actually play the game--the "xtreme tower" is the only set that made it into the game itself, and it was a really watered down version of the information center from the first two games. but the island was, in the game, filled with incredible buildings that would have made really cool sets.

0 air chase woosh! the brickster's seaplane flies over the beach quickly. hippie dude is in close pursuit on his hang glider. fuel is running out for the brickster's plane. can hippie dude catch him before he either gets away or crash lands in the water... you decide, with island xtreme stunts air chase. set #: 6735 theme: island xtreme stunts year released: 2002 piece count: 83 minifigs: 2 list price: $10 (usd) a nice addition to the island xtreme stunts theme, air chase includes two air vehicles; a seaplane and hang glider. the set has nice island colors inclusing white, light blue, and orange. also includes in the set are some great chrome pieces for the brickster's airplane wings. starting with the box. you can see hippie dude in close pursuit: the back of the box depicts some nice alternate jet skis: same front box picture on the instructions: and on the backside, pictures of the video game: air chase includes two nicely detailed figs, hippie dude (for lack of his official name), and the brickster: here's a picture of the orange hang-glider: and the underside: unfortunately, the hang-glider is too heavy to be held up by a minigig. while i like the brick-built glider for the extra pieces, the plastic wing pieces from the ninja theme would have worked effectively and be a lot lighter. i think the seaplane is the best part of the set: here's a shot of the front end. i like the skeletal shark/fish design. what's great is none of the pieces use stickers. they are all printed: including the tail end: although the cockpit has no steering wheel or lever piece, it does have a very nice printed 1x2 tile: the wings of the airplane have hinges to allow them to fold inward slightly: also notice the nice chrome/silver pieces. here's a shot of the underside of the seaplane: and lastly, the complete set: final thoughts: air chase is another one of those "fun" island sets. two figs with two vehicles make a perfect combination for creating some dog-fights in the air. at the same time, the brickster's plane can land in the water to explore other adventure play opportunities. this set is also a nice addition to the island xtreme stunts truck & stunt trikes (6739). the seaplane can be hauled by the large semi-truck included within 6739. hope you enjoy this review.

-1 nice review. is that one minifig breaking out of prison? (just wondering about his clothing.) the worst thing is the name. anything with xtreme in the title almost deserves the lowest score possible on principle.

0 shoc, on sep 9 2008, 05:55 pm, said: thanks for the review! i loved this theme, it had some of the greatest pieces ever arranged in any theme, brilliant printed parts and figures, and some good colours. snap lockitt (hippie dude ) is a great figure with a cool name, i own him from another set, but unfortunately not this one. it looks like a very good set, no stickers and good printed parts too. nice review. hahaha. that made me laugh for some reason... i don't know why though, i agree with it. i have him as well, i got him from the orange jet-ski set.

0 i knew this set looked familiar... thank you, brickster for bringing one of my first lego sets ever back to my memory. unfortunately, i don't have many of the pieces left... but thank you!

1 hello all eurobricks members and town lovers, today, i will be doing up a review on glade runner set. this is a very small set which is slightly bigger than the current impulse set. it's part of the race theme which involved in land and sea racers back in the early 1990s. i just love these orignal race themes which is produced back then. name: glade runner theme: lego system / town / race year: 1993 pieces: 29 minifigs: 1 price: usd$3.25 an image of a 6513, glade runner swamp race shall begins this glade runner is pretty nice looking with its sleek sports look. well, for a glade runner in the water, it certainly looks much impressive. somehow, i felt that the 6513 is aligned with the 6514 trail ranger. i always had that perception that both vehicles are brothers and was released under the same year. in fact, glade runner was released in 1993 based on peeron information. i always felt that this set is used for investigators or police to used for tracking or search purposes in the swamp areas instead of using it for a race. i will place this set in the jungle, somewhere like brickster's jungle settings. although it looks too bright for such serious agenda, but i think it's pretty useful to use it this way. they can rent it from the nearby shop and used it to search. it kind of reminded me of the movie, us marshals which acted by tommy lee jones and wesley snipes. meet the ace please pardon his trousers. i did not bleach it earlier. (it was caused overtime without adequate caring to the minfig. look at this great article on how to protect your lego!) the driver wears a green vest with patch pockets on both sides. this is my favourite design during that period. it comes with a yellow lifevest too. as for the 1x4 printed tile with 3 stars shining in front of the runner, it's a very nice printed tile that can be used for other racing purposes in other sets as well. overall design the built is very simple and yet so realistic. making use of the aeroplane tailhead to add as the holder for the rotor is smart. the white bricks acting as a platform for both sides to hold the driver to sit onto the centre with the steering wheel at the front. i am very happy with this design. place the glade runner in front of the fan with a reasonable fan speed. you will see the rotor runs like a charm. different angles of the vehicle close encounter with the "swamp sharks" coined by brickster! see you later to conclude, this is a very nice little set that can provide much fun. i don't really used it to race in the waters. instead, i leave it to my imagination and used it for police investigation purposes such as air crash excerise, search and rescue operations and etc. i think it can provides quite a fun loving experience. although, the set might not be very appealing to some people, but i find it very fun to play around and is one of my favourite sets in the 1990s where i placed it with my 6514 trail ranger together. summary review playability: 8.5/10 (i leave it to your imagnination.) design: 9/10 (very simple yet realistic design.) price: 10/10 (a very inexpensive set. great way to buy such small sets at a low price.) overall: 8.5/10 (glade runner is not common in town and city theme. it's not a must to have it, but if you ever come across it. do get it) i gave it a "4" based on my review score card. what about yours? hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. comments and critics are strongly welcomed. pictures can be found in my brickshelf (when moderated)

1 thanks for the nice review whitefang! i quite like this set. the front looks a bit bare, but for a small set like this, it doesn't really matter. this set gets a 4 from me as well.

1 nice review white fang. this really reminds me of an "all-american" set with its red, white, and blue colors (and the white stars). although i really like the fig with its scruffy bearded face, i find the green torso a bit odd for this set. i suppose i would expect some sort of red/blue racer fig with a white/blue racing helmet. swamp sharks - too funny! . you always add a nice addition of humor to your reviews. now i'm going to check out some wonder woman clips on youtube.

1 this is one of those sets that make me really want to start building up a city. it's a great value, has a lot of useful pieces, and is just plain fun to play with. i do miss vehicles having doors though. great review. i was a bit curious as to how the dumping mechanism worked. as well as the sticker count.

1 yeah, the name on this set is strange. i think all the boxes say garbage truck. i guess it's up to each builder to decide whether 1x1 round plates are recyclable material or not. it's a great model in any case. i love these highly detailed city trucks we've been getting during the last year or two. i used to have a preference for the late 80s/early 90s city line but some of these new sets have really surpassed them in detail and functionality.

1 nice truck indeed, but the yellow one is better i think, at least if you put them on a roadplate it seems to me that those road plates are too small for that. also it will not empty completely because of that panel. well, for the rest it is a nice set and a fine review!

1 i own this set and i think it's a really nice truck, but there is two little details that i didn't like : 1/ a recycle truck really needs 2 minifig, one to drive, one to put the garbage on the back. 2/ the big hole behind the driver seat, it was easy to fill it like this : with hole pouf ! no more little hole! but this is really a great set anyway. 4/5 for me ( above average )

0 nice review. this is a very nice vehicle, one of my favorite of the newer city ones. jopiek: there are two generations of road plate that are wide enough for six-wide vehicles like this. the current plates are dark grey with plain white printing, and look not great in my opinion. the previous ones are imo the best road plates of all time - green with dark grey road, white dotted line/zebras, drain covers and yellow verge markings (just like we really have here in ireland). for urban area i would still choose the green-edged plates and just cover up the green - the markings are so much better than the current plates.

1 jopiek, on sep 10 2008, 01:45 am, said: also it will not empty completely because of that panel. actually, it does. the back part of the truck with the panel hinges up, so that when you want the truck to dump, it doesn't get in the way.

1 what a great set and a very nice review erdbeereis. i think the only improvement to this set would have been the use of chrome exhaust pipes and front grill. i bought this set with a lot of excitement, but unfortunately have not put it together yet. what are your thoughts on these larger 6-stud wide detailed vehicles as opposed to 4-stud wide classics? here's an image of 6668 recycle truck released in 1992: ps. i like the use of "taking out" sponge bob in your review.

1 this looks like a great set, and i'm happy you were dumping spongebob, he deserves that. this set looks very nice, and if i see it i will probably pick it up.

1 thanks for the review! this is one of the few city sets that i own (despite loving the theme so much, most of my town is either custom or classic), and it's about as beautiful as a big garbage truck can ever be. quote nice truck indeed, but the yellow one is better i think, at least if you put them on a roadplate it seems to me that those road plates are too small for that. also it will not empty completely because of that panel. well, for the rest it is a nice set and a fine review! well, the truck barely fits onto the old roadplates (not on curves though), so if you put it in a display it probably won't look bad. i think from what i see, this and all the other 6 wide vehicles will fit much better on the newer roadplates, which are four studs wider than the old ones.

0 hi, i bought this set a while ago, and have since remodeled it into a larger 8 wide truck. now it can hold a driver and passenger. its kind of boxy, i may redesign it in the future.

1 that's a really nice mod badsneaker! the added bulk serves it well.

-1 i like this set, but i can't give it a good grade for playability, as the rearmost hinging section is too stiffly hinged, so when you open it, it's likely to break if you hold it just over the shovel and broom. my truck thus has that function, and with it of course the whole container tipping, disabled. i also moved the cab a bit forward and the front axle rearward to give the cab the typical garbage truck look, as they are often very low slung. this also created space behind the cab for some equipment.

1 nice review i realy need to pick up this set! and the cement truck too
