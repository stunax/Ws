306 lunar landing plates year released 1979 piece count 2 minifigs 0 list price unknown as part of the classic space collection lego offered two sets of moon plates one was a set of two crater plates and the other this very useful landing plate set not much to review but worth sharing a few images the landing plate and tplate the two plates connect to form this very nice classic space landing platform set 497 galaxy explorer included the landing platform but the one that i had was lighter in color than the one contained in this set at least the yellow circle future lego space sets could benefit by having similar road plates share your thoughts	neutral
cp5670 on jul 7 2008 1004 pm said i like the black space plates from the early 90s better 6710 awesome i had not seen these before they would really make nice plates for a sw death star scene thanks for sharing	positive
whitefang on jul 7 2008 1142 pm said actually with only 2 plates i could not do much serious expansion with it instead i merged it with my old city baseplates and used it as a docking station for scientific purposes or restricted facilities that is guarded by the police you make a very good point there ive used these plates to represent restricted areas and even as simple airport runways beyond their space uses i never liked the black plates they were during my dark ages anyway so ive never really seen one up close but i have seen them used in a death star display as suggested and it turned out fairly well	neutral
these plates are great in setting up your space base and giving your ships a place to land my favorite though is the lunar crater plate which i use to death in my comic 	positive
why pay 350 dollars just download the instructions on buy the pieces off bricklink this is was i did when i wanted to create the blacktron ii in the futuron colour scheme also i tend to like both sets of base plates i bought the black ones myself and they were of great use but there more for creating the idea of a city or space station something more completely man made the gray ones give a better look of the roads being laid over bare rock especially when you introduce the plates with the craters i would love to see a 4848 baseplate with roads through them which would allow more building space on the side and maybe some craters also 4848 baseplates with craters but a few different kinds to create more or a realistic look and less of a repeating pattern and with all those rocks you have to put everything up on supports much better looking bases then	negative

cp5670 on jul 8 2008 0504 am said these are pretty good but i think they look too much like the standard town roads from that period i like the black space plates from the early 90s better 6710 oh how i love these plates afew years ago i found a local retail store with about 67 sets of these in their basement warehouse i was given special access to along with many other old space goodies hehe i love the things i have loads and ive used them for multiple space bases and battles along with afew grey crater plates and the large grey plates 15x the size of a normal baseplate you can get quite a monorail layout going sigh i should really clean up and get one set up again so i can take some pictures	positive

nice review sinner the old sets i donÂ´t know  every old set especially equipped with the old nonmoveable arms minifigs look very odd nowadays i agree with you with the hull shape and its possibility to be extended but every other aspect the lack of detail the keel itself you canÂ´t float it in shallow water keeps me from rating it higher than 310 in my opninion the best police boat so far is 4021 click to enlarge	negative

snefroe on aug 7 2008 0753 am said my parents always needed to keep my quiet during the 3day trip and the best way to do that was to buy me a lego set this still works nowadays quote i often saw large quantities of lego sets in those gas stations though i remember seeing yellow castle and the galaxy explorer standing on a shelf these were the times although i donÂ´t recall lego sets in fuel stations in the past i would appreciate to see lego on the go now itÂ´s holiday time and i have two sons you know	positive
as you may have seen in my topic in general lego discussion i received a bunch of old lego from my stepgrandmotherinlaw among the bricks were instructions and pieces for an almost complete set 345 from 1969 i was very excited to find this out so i put it together i recently took it apart and reassembled it taking photographs along the way for the sake of eurobricks so without further ado set 345 house with car first off is the car this was still constructed in the bucket of bricks i received so i never took it apart next ill show you the instructions lots of added bricks per step which was fun however the angle of the instructions sometimes made it difficult to find where things were supposed to go the inbuild shots finally an allaround view of the finished set sadly i dont have much time to post more pictures or thoughts however ill try to come back and update the review later this week until then enjoy	positive
nice review mariko this set is way past my time the baseplate is okay though i hate those dots the car is pretty cool too	positive
great review i never had this set but it looks nice i really like the checker pattern near the big window	positive
great review mariko this set is way before my time too i like how lego used to create simple one story houses instead of the really tall house that we see in todays town theme such as 8403 city house one story houses such as 345 just look more realistic to my eyes the simplistic minimalism vibe that i get with this set is something that is hard to find in todays much more detailed sets although trust me i love love love todays detailed sets  the brick is epic	positive
theres two alternates on the back of the instructions and as i recall some sort of bridge on the inner fold or back of box i threw away the box to this set years ago just lucky to still have all the pieces with standard pieces you can build all these alternates and many more thats why i dont particularly care for the new castles like vladeks they make building so difficult and duplicate pieces are so limited heres an old shot of the castle in the city that it use to guard we played for hours back in these days	neutral
great review it is nice to see an indepth photo review of this set i especially love the last picture of your old city it certainly does bring back memories	positive
yup that is very very nicei wish i had been alive back then d well ill never have a chance to own something like this so this is as close ill get to it thanks for showing me the greatness	positive

i guess its easiest to put the entire shield on a transparent sticker and cut the edges i would also do that with the white stickers because now you can still see the gray edges of the shield perhaps you can make a bigger black or brown in the other case outline you also wouldnt be able to see if the sticker is exactly in the middle	neutral

theme hobby sets set name harleydavidson 1000cc set number 394 price new 260280  185200 euro price used 14175  10125 euro pieces 143 year of release 1976 links peeron bricklink and brickset looking at the release date of this set makes me remember the good old times when lego sets stayed in production and could be found in stores for long years yes i hear you younger fols say this meant we had less variety at the time but at least we did not have to go on a frenzy to get them all in just 1 or 2 years before they disappeared to reappear on the secondary market at crazy prices anyway i also realise this set is older than me by 5 years at least the first boxes of this set i think my parents bought it when i was something like 12 year old or even before as my father really liked the hobby set line and took any chance to get one you know for the kids when theyâ€™ll be old enough to play with themâ€¦ i am really happy my father did it too as a matter of fact this has always been one of my favourite nonminifigure scale sets i know younger eyes will look on it and wonder how we could love and enjoy a model like this so blocky and rough just remember this was the best tlg designers could do with the bricks available at the time enough about memories letâ€™s start with the review the box front the front of the box here cut and folded to save space shows the harley davidson 1000cc in all its glory upon a nice town landscape i really appreciate how tlg box designers used a real life photo of the model in a real life environment to give this hobby set a better background moreover the landscape does not distract the eye even with its lights since the focus is strongly set on the motorbike itself back and sides the back of the box shows the model on a more neutral background and from another angle we can see the stickers in place take a good look at them here because i did not apply them the right side we also see a pic of the set from the front and one with a child playing with it in this latter shot the model rests upon a nice black box with a harley davidson sign on it i frankly do not remember if this was some sort of tray or smaller box within the lego one or if it is meant for publicity only another thing we can notice on the rightmost side of the box is a white band right below the lego logo sporting the sign â€˜designed for experienced lego buildersâ€™ in various languages all in all a really well done and professional job contents inside this set includes a number of parts in mainly black white and light grey some blue and yellow add nice touches of colour to the total the partsâ€™ selection is not mindblowing as most of the pieces had been in production in these same colours for years anyway iâ€™d like to focus on a couple of details the milky white technic axles as well as the red technic bush old 2 are among my favourite parts the bushes in particular are quite useful to build more sturdy looking tubes than what can be achieved with the newer and slimmer ones it would seem that the tile pieces appeared in the â€˜without groveâ€™ version as a standard and in the â€˜with groveâ€™ version as alternates see bricklink inventory notice though that the box above and instructionsâ€™ below pictures all show the â€˜with groveâ€™ variety as said there are no recoloured parts in this set new pieces the few new molds used in this set are black and white slope inverted 45 2 x 2 old type with round bottom tube black technic brick 1 x 2 with hole type ii and red hinge plate 2 x 4 with articulated joint â€“ male and female the most interesting piece from this lot as many of you will have noticed is the technic brick 1 x 2 with hole type ii this kind of technic brick was use during 1976 and 1977 only it would seem tlg tried a new design variant which did not meet success and was later replaced with the standard bricks again nonetheless iâ€™m sure that people who own these bricks like them for the unusual design and the possibilities they offer into adding details to their creations instructions cover â€“ as usual the instructions are not organised in the form of a booklet but they consist of a folded double printed sheet the â€˜coverâ€™ shows again the same shot as the front of the box with bigger lego logo and set number and without the other additional information â€˜back coverâ€™ â€“ here we see the full name of the set harleydavidson flh 1200 this makes me wonder why is this set known as 394 harley davidson 1000cc when it is indeed a 1200cc anyway what really makes me love this page is the list of stats below the photo and in particular these two lines hp not given this calls for just one question why did harleydavidson not release this info my opinion is that since this is a motorbike built for the police they did not have permission to share the specifications on the motor which was probably customised either by harleydavidson upon request or by the police themselves â€˜random pageâ€™ â€“ as expected no callouts here but the build is pretty straight forward and does not need them apart for one passage weâ€™ll see later the colours are easy to tell apart in the end there is no dark grey in this set that could be confused with black again notice how the instructions include the â€˜with groveâ€™ tiles and not the older ones maybe this was changed during the long time this set stayed in production the â€˜last pageâ€™ shows other four models included in the hobby set line unfortunately i own only one of them the 396 thatcher perkins locomotive indeed i would have liked to have them all building start the handle bars look a bit too squared to me but itâ€™s just a minor feature and the overall shape is still good in my opinion notice the red hinge plate which will be almost totally hidden in the finished model see below and the blue tiles which work as indicators the first steps used to build the front wheel and windshield are really easy until you get to the wheel in facts the instructions do not show clearly all the pieces needed for it and i found myself with a â€˜floatingâ€™ wheel for the absence of one of the red technic bush old 2 on one side the one not visible on the instructions of course not a big deal but something that could have been done better motor and seat the second part of the build includes the motor seat and â€˜saddle bagsâ€™ the technique used for the motor or better the radiator is very clever to get the ridged feel tlg designers used 4 light grey plates stuck one on the other but not completely in contact this way the studs while keeping the plates in position keep them raised from one another at the same time the yellow round bricks add some details and colour touches to this predominantly light grey parts of the vehicle the use of the engine smooth small 1 x 2 side plates for the exhaust pipes while quite clever still looks a bit strange to me iâ€™m mostly used to see them in airplanes helicopters and spaceships â€˜saddlebagsâ€™ a simple build for one of the iconic parts of this motorcycle here you see them in place as well as get a look at the finished seat i like how lego designers managed to make its shape with just a few quite big bricks the â€˜saddle bagsâ€™ are a really nice touch and they work perfectly when compared to the original this is the rear wheel as said before only when you get to this passage in the instruction you get a real understanding of how the front wheel is supposed to be mounted as well careful readers will notice how this is not one of the original wheels in this set the original ones were mounted using the technic gear expert builder 9 tooth unfortunately i could only find one of them in my collection an itâ€™s used as the front wheel by adding the rear wheel which is shown from a better angle in the instructions we complete the model notice how the two technic bricks supporting the wheel are held in position by two 2x1 plates i think this was a bad case of â€˜building by compartmentsâ€™ mentality if tlg designers had considered this a bit more they would have used 2 4x1 plates instead of 4 2x1 on the other hand this is not the worst case i have seen in a lego set and they keep up the tradition nowadays too finished set front and here it is our fancy police harleydavidson indeed the front looks blocky and quite horrible to our eyes but again it was almost the best that could be done at the time i only wish they had made it a little less bulky even though this build is clearly thought to give better stability to the wheel the blue tiles work nicely to emphasise the indicators the slightly unsightly red plate is normally covered by the plate sticker and the windshield albeit being hard to see through is nicely shaped back the back side is less detailed than the front but shows the red light and antenna which are typical of the police motorbikes from this period how many times have we seen this angle in the chase scenes from tv shows like â€œchipsâ€ side all in all this model looks pretty sturdy apart for the antenna which falls off all too easily and detailed especially considering the limited variety of parts available and used at the time they even got so far to put a 2x2 tile as kickstand to display it without fear of it falling on the sides bonus images size comparison what i never understood about this set is what scale it is meant to be i mean it is clearly not minifigscale and it could not be technicfigscale those came later but it is not even miniland scale moreover the only other model with the same scale is the other hobby set motorbike as the cars have a scale of their own and the thatcher uses still another one final comments overall this is a great set for collectors of old models and motorbike fans or both it does not sport a huge variety of bricks but was a good choice at the time and even if the result is matteroffact blocky when compared to the original it implements some good solutions to minimise the lego brick appearance and maximise the similarity as much as possible design  colour scheme â€“ 910 the design is as accurate as possible apart for the front mudguard maybe and the colours are completely in line for a police vehicle the solutions and details included in this set justify the â€˜expert buildersâ€™ label and add to the appearance and why not playability of the model parts  810 not a huge selection and very few new molds nonetheless a good source of black and white standard parts for mocs and one of the few sources for the extra rare technic brick 1 x 2 with hole type ii pieces playability  910 a sturdy model which can take some serious play and swooshing without falling apart the easily detachable antenna and the lack of an appropriate scale interaction with most other models make it lose one point though build  710 pretty straight forward with few nice solutions and an already mentioned slightly obscure passage in the instructions price  510 like most older models especially the hobby set and model team ones this set can be found at reasonable prices only rarely most of the times people are asked shameful prices for such a smallish set overall 810 very good as always questions comments and pic requests welcome edited by whitefang 17 april 2011  0619 pm indexed	positive
great job on this review of a unique and rare set luxorv considering the year it was released this must have been a cool set back then even up to now with all the specialized pieces and advanced building techniques i could still appreciate the beauty of this brickbuilt harleydavidson police motorbike the various elements are instantly recognizable and it even has the unusual partlystacked plates technique for the motor overall id say this is an above average set that is a musthave for any hardcore lego collector	positive
luxorv this is an awesome review the classicness of this set is just lovely its so easy to just fall in love with this set youre review is outstanding as well the pictures are so clear and the review is just solid youve really polished your reviewing skills	positive
thanks for the feedback guys indeed this is a great set and im very attached to it as far as i remember i got it for say my 2nd birthday i think but it is not my first lego set youll learn more on this in my next planned review	positive
thanks luxorv for this review of such a classic old lego set and i do remember seeing these in a catalogue years ago excellent brickbuilt police cycle i think its time lego did another one eh  brick on ride on everyone 	positive
theme hobby sets set name thatcher perkins locomotive set number 396 price new 369450  258314 euro price used 100355  45250 euro pieces 434 year of release 1976 links peeron bricklink and brickset my father assures me this is the very first lego set i ever got in facts he gave it to me as a present for my first half year of course that is to say he bought it for himself and used me as the official excuse when i grew up at first i found it to be quite boring no minifigures limited play features in the end it was just a locomotive it soon went to forgottenland then when i was about 10 years old i one day found again the instructionsâ€™ â€˜bookletâ€™ and saw this bright coloured big steam engine and i suddenly wanted to build it again it would seem i finally got to the right age at least for me to appreciate the design of this great set but enough about memories letâ€™s start with the review the box front the front of the box here cut and folded to save space shows the thatcher perkins locomotive in all its glory upon a nice countryside landscape i really appreciate how tlg box designers used a real life environment made of sand gravel and pebbles to give this hobby set a better background moreover the landscape does not distract the eye since the focus is strongly set on the locomotive itself the box measures about 395 x 245 x 55 centimetres or 1556 x 965 x 217 inches this is more or less the size of the 4840  the burrow or the advent calendars back and sides the back of the box shows the model on a more neutral background and from another angle we can see the stickers in place take a good look at them here because i did not apply them the right side we also see a pic of the set from the 34 back and one with a child playing with it in this latter shot the model rests upon a nice black box with a thatcher perkins sign on it unlike the harley davidson 1000cc set the thatcher perkins does not have the sign â€˜designed for experienced lego buildersâ€™ for some reason contents inside this set includes a large number of parts mainly black blue and red with some nice yellow to lighten it up more parts of interest the partsâ€™ selection is not exceptional but weâ€™ll see this set includes some unique pieces which have not been in lego sets for long years since the 1980s like the very nice black plate modified 1 x 2 with steam engine cylinder flat surfaces black train wheel spoked for motor and the red train steam drive rod holder  train steam drive rod group the wheel spoked large as beautiful as they were saw the light from the production line for the last time in 1976 the only new mold used in this set is the black and blue slope inverted 45 2 x 2 old type with round bottom tube as you can see in the above picture this locomotive was designed to work well be played with on all kind of surfaces so the wheels sport tyres in this picture you can see how they look without the tyres of course builders can use the thatcher perkins on their brickbuilt tracks another group of interesting parts are shown in this pic red wheel spoked 2 x 2 with stud and tyre black brick modified 2 x 4 with wheels holder old clear bottom and yellow minifig head plain  stud solid many newer fans will not be familiar with the last two parts they were standard fare in a number of sets between the 1960s and early 1990s but then unfortunately they were taken out of production to be fair the replacement of the black brick modified 2 x 4 with wheels holder old clear bottom with the standard technic parts was probably due to the fact that the metal pin used to connect the wheels to these bricks had a shameful tendency at getting off the wheel too bad it could not be fixed and these parts kept in production for those interested here is a picture of the dss courtesy of peeron instructions cover â€“ as usual the instructions are not organised in the form of a booklet but they consist of a folded double printed sheet the â€˜coverâ€™ shows again the same shot as the front of the box â€˜back coverâ€™ â€“ here we see the name of the set and some additional information like the year when the first thatcher perkins started working 1863 and the type 460 of this locomotive which as shown in the image is related to the number and position of the wheels on a side note the pencil signs on the sides of the sheet were made by my father while counting the parts in the set â€˜random pageâ€™ â€“ as expected no callouts here but the build is pretty straight forward and does not need them the colours are easy to tell apart full page â€“ as you may have noticed all the building steps are drawn on one side of the â€˜bookletâ€™ making it more properly an instructionsâ€™ sheet what really makes this â€˜instruction bookletâ€™ stand out in my eyes is the fact that it is indeed a poster the building steps are all on one side while the other is a bigger image of the completed set with the name thatcher perkins in yellow enclosed in an old styled red tag building start the build starts with the base of the locomotive putting the 10 wheels in place and strengthening the engine notice the use of this â€˜illegalâ€™ technique to build the bumpers lego as we all know can be a tricky medium to build with and some details need special solutions to be completed we then start building the boiler and cabin going up fast and steady in the penultimate step we build the chimney and cow catcher iâ€™d like to spend a few more words on the chimney and how it is attached to the main body as you can see in the left picture the 3x3 base of the chimney is asymmetrical with a 3x2 base on one side and a combination of a 1x2 and a 1x1 plates on the other in the right picture you see the top of the main body where the chimney will be attached it is made of a 1x2 base and 1 1x2 tile using another â€˜illegalâ€™ technique or at least one lego designers do not like much nowadays the holes of the 3x2 plate of the chimney will connect with the studs of the 1x2 plate on the main body giving a well centred and quite sturdy build finished set front the front of the model sports 3 big headlights a nice cow catcher and the nicely detailed engine front i can almost hear it whistle side and here it is our good old thatcher perkins locomotive indeed it looks like a classic and powerful engine form one of those spaghetti western films doesnâ€™t it what i found strange in the beginning is the choice of colours i was convinced steam engines were all black at the time then i checked some pictures of the original and i must admit the resemblance is almost perfect back the back side is less detailed than the front with cabin almost devoid of details i think lego could have done a better job on it 34 front and â€¦ just see how good it looks from this angle with all the tubing moving parts and the lovely 3 headlights â€¦ 34 back the back view is not as impressive but grants us a good look at the big posterior wheels and the bumpers bonus images size comparison as i stated elsewhere i never understood what scale these hobby sets are meant to be they are clearly not minifigscale and they are not technicfigscale either but they are not even miniland scale moreover they use different scales between locomotives cars and motorbikes amongst the hobby set line as i said before the set comes with tyres on the wheels to allow a wider playing experience not limiting this model to tracks nonetheless builders can assemble their own track maybe using the vintage blue 45v tracks and make the thatcher perkins run its proper environment final comments overall this is a great set for collectors of old models and steam engines fans or both it does not sport a huge variety of bricks but was a good choice at the time and even if the result is matteroffact a bit blocky when compared to the original it implements some good solutions to minimise the lego brick appearance and maximise the similarity as much as possible design  colour scheme â€“ 810 the design is as accurate as possible and the colours are completely in line for the thatcher perkins locomotive the solutions and details included in this set justify the â€˜expert buildersâ€™ label and add to the appearance and why not playability of the model though i still wish tlg had included more details in the cabin parts  1010 quite a big selection but only one new mould nonetheless a good source of black blue and red standard parts for mocs and one of the few sources for the extra rare black plate modified 1 x 2 with steam engine cylinder flat surfaces black train wheel spoked for motor red train steam drive rod holder  train steam drive rod group and wheel spoked large playability  910 a sturdy model which can take some serious play and swooshing without falling apart the somewhat easily detachable chimney and the lack of an appropriate scale interaction with most other models make it lose one point though build  710 pretty straight forward with few nice solutions price  510 like most older models especially the hobby set and model team ones this set can only rarely be found at reasonable prices most of the times people are asked shameful prices for such a smallish set overall 810 very good more pictures can be found in this brickshelf gallery as always questions comments and pic requests welcome edited by rufus 10 july 2011  0705 pm

rare classic sets are always a priceless part of any lego collection and its a good thing you still have this first set of yours luxor or did you purchase a new one excellent review btw its always a pleasure getting a closer look at these classic sets which i wouldnt have known to exist had i not seen this review overall i think its a really good set at that time of course judging this one by modern standards wont be fair but at the time im pretty sure it was a cool set to have though less cooler than having the harley davidson set	positive

indexed 410 â€“ payloader theme legolandvehicle piece count 28 year released 1973 msrp  links brickset lugnet peeron bricklink note this set was released under the number 604 outside of the us ah classic legoland a time before minifigs ever existed and cars and buildings could be made with just a few bricks the part selection was pretty basic bricks plates slopes windows and wheels were all you needed to construct an entire town heavy machinery could be modeled in 4wide and be just a few bricks tall for this review we will be taking a look at the 410 payloader one of legoâ€™s first sets of a bucket loader so grab a hard hat we are heading to the construction yard box image courtesy of bricklink box contents here we have our instructions which are obviously the older style of lego instructions the steps used much simpler imagery but they get the job done they show how to build the payloader in seven steps this small set has all of 28 parts in it the more interesting parts of note are the red digger arm the bucket the blue 1x2 brick with arm holes and the blue 2x2 brick with the classic lego logo printed on it construction in the first few steps we start building up the base then add the arms and start building the cab add the bucket the trailer socket and finish the cab throw on some wheels completed set and with that we are finished with our nice small model here is the back right side notice how the back of the cab was left with an empty spot here is the left side notice how on the top of the arm they made it so you could just push down on the tips it to make the arm lift instead of having to grab by the arm itself on the front we have the nice lego logo shown to remind the forgetful of what they were playing with you can also see how much space is in the bucket itself which cant hold more than a few small plates finally on the back we have the trailer socket this was a nice addition to make it able to tow trailers from other sets like 685 just donâ€™t try to bring it into your layout populated by minifigs they may have a problem trying to get in other thoughts considering this set is nearly 37 years old i myself am still surprised by how well the bricks have held up i purchased this set from a thrift store a year ago for a mere 25 cents normally when used lego is purchased you can expect to see scratches marks wearing discoloration etc but boy was i surprised to see how all these parts are in mint condition even the instructions still looked like they came from a new box and not all ripped up and tattered the pieces still connect to each other nice and tight and the metal pieces for the wheels havent rusted this just shows that with proper care these things can last a lifetime i really would like to get a small display case to show it off conclusion playability 810 in addition to the standard of having rolling wheels you also get a fully movable bucket assembly with it you can pick up smaller pieces and unload them into a dump truck design 710 like all other legoland vehicles it has a very basic design but you can still easily identify what it is simple yet effective parts 710 like most other older lego sets all you really get are a few basic bricks and plates however you do get a bucket assembly and the 2x2 brick with the classic lego logo on it is very cool it was also nice of lego to include the trailer socket so you could tow around your trailers price 810 bricklinks history shows them to sell for around 10 usd used while that is a bit much for a set this size it is pretty good considering this set is over 37 years old however if you are looking for a new boxed set be prepared to fork over about 50 usd overall 810 this small machine would make a nice addition to your collection as a reminder of legos past so what are your thoughts on this classic set edited by thebrickster 01 june 2010  0555 am	positive
thank you very much for this wonderful review this is the oldest lego set in my collection i received this model from my grand parents many years ago  im not exactly sure who in my family it used to belong to but it has a home with me now its a very simple but attractive looking vehicle and functions pretty well too overall very nice	positive
thanks for the great nostalgic review great pictures i love the shiny glow of 37 year old bricks sets were simpler back then but not less exciting in their own way i wasnt even born in 1973 but one of my first sets was the 1982 update of this 6630 bucket loader almost 10 years later but the very same bucket assembly only the colours have changed	positive
ah the good old daysthanks for the review yoshi648  cute and cool at the same time its interesting to see that the same front end parts had been used from the early 70s up in to the late 90s  nice again to step back in time and keep on bricking everyone 	positive
woah 25 cents for a mint condition set thats amazing	neutral
well its not exactly a large shuttle but still a nice set 442 space shuttle year released 1979 piece count 79 minifigs 1 vehicles 0 list price unknown this little classic was my smallest classic space set believe it or not i still have the box heres the back the instructions are pretty tattered and missing a section i had to download some from the web but the ship is again intact missing only one grey 1x3 plate ive always liked this computer piece heres the under side this set included the small classic jet engines a closeup of the sloped printed space brick and the complete set with minifig this set was a great little space ship that made a nice addition to the blue space theme as small as it was it could hold twothree figs one standing up i dont even think the mars mission recon drop ship holds three figs in any case it was a musthave for blue space fans and probably only a few bucks back in the day swoosh	neutral
its simply amazing how far lego has come in 30 years	positive
this classic space shuttle is simply superb i love the layout of this shuttle in fact it reminded me as one of the space fighter jet that roam around in space defending the boundaries from intruders i just love these old grey bricks very much and the printed computer brick is just lovely its such a pity that i did not grow up with classic space in my childhood these are actually great stuff and formed the base of the space theme in lego brickster thanks again for another outstanding classic review	positive
this was my first space set ever 1979 1980 dont know anymore but i do remember i got this together with 897 for my birthday when we where camping with a little luck i may even have an old film from my dad opening the boxes well what to say it looked soooooo aggressive with those two engines but i never knew why you needed two steering wheels on it they probably just thought a symmetrical model was better  i cant blame them what a nice set it would even sell today no doubt looooots of swooshability	positive
the computer is my favorite part sadly i dont own any classic spaceexept for some space police and a blue classic space man	positive
nice 442 is the lowest set number i have seen for any classic space set so it must been released with the first wave in 1978 its remarkable that a lego spaceship this old and small can seat more figs than the much bigger mx71 recon dropship of today anyway i just want to grab it out of the screen and swoosh it all over the place lol tlg please make these classic space sets again i promise ill buy many	positive
indexed everyone remembers their first time for me it was in 19coughsomethingsomethingcough we were at her house and her mother was gone for at least an hour she slowly unzi uhhh sorry wrong story um yeahh anyway i do remember my first time it was 1977 in late summer our neighbor who worked for a department store called famousbahr said that the main store had a travelling lego display so my family filed into the car and drove into downtown st louis to see this display to tell you the truth i dont remember much about the display itself but i do remember that my parents bought me my first lego set set  456 the spirit of st louis set  456 also sold as set  661 name spirit of st louis theme legoland  large vehicle year 1977 pieces 49 minifigs 0 price 500 usd bricklink misb start  17500 usd used complete 3500 usd links peeron bricklink brickset packaging box front the original box that my set came in was most likely trashed 5 minutes after returning home this image was lovingly stolen off of the peeron page for this set i feel lucky that i even got this much similarly i have no pictures of the plastic baggies the set came in truth be told i cant be sure that there even were plastic baggies that the parts came in the set side view well there she is my first set ever  actually i seem to recall the real spirit of st louis was silver colored not black and yellow if you need a history lesson the spirit of st louis was charles lindberghs plane when he made the first transatlantic solo flight more details can be found on the wikipedia page the overall shape is pretty close at least the cockpit window could stand to be moved forward one stud but everything seems to be relatively close the tail piece isnt the right shape but it is likely the only tail piece lego produced at the time if you look closely you can see the various bite marks that my brother and i inflicted over the years i know some people would be aghast that there are bite marks but brick separators wouldnt come out for another 10 years besides we were young we didnt know any better i certainly had no idea that it would become my obsession there are some interesting part choices here everything is brick and plate built as you might expect the same set nowadays would have lots of slope wedges and wedge plates to round things out but lego was all about the brick in 77 so bricks are what we got the black inverted slopes worked pretty well asthetically as the wing struts the wings are simple 4 x 10 plates nice and square there were no minifigs in this set if i remember correctly 1977 was just about the time when minifigs made their first appearance i know i have one other set from 77 that does include a minifg at least i dont have a lot of comments for the following photos ill let the pictures speak for themselves 34 view back back 34 top front parts interesting pieces i have no idea if there were any extra pieces that came with this set i kind of doubt it instead i took a photo of some of the interesting parts to the model that translucent white piece didnt photograph so well but it is a technic axle 8 thats right sets from 1977 contained technic elements the two black parts are the forerunners to the 1 x 2 technic brick as well everytime i hear someone on the forums complain about technic elements in system sets i think back to this set the round brick is special as well here is a closer view of it complete with bite marks  round brick as you can see the stud is closed it is only one of two closed stud 1 x 1 round bricks that i own they stopped appearing in sets in 1981 for those that are interested the dss you thought you were going to escape this heading didnt you surprise yes even in 1977 lego sets had stickers the oldest printed elements i can remember were in the classic space sets that started in 1979 again when people in the forums complain about dss in sets i can only help think of this set and chuckle to myself maniacally the sticker has held up really well considering its been stuck on the brick for 32 years no discoloration very little curling i think if all stickers held up this well over time there would be less dss complaints the ratings playability 610  the set is quite swooshable and the propellor spins outside of that though minifigs na design 610  the overall shape is quite good especially given the era the color choice leaves a lot to be desired price 110  its been retired for 30 years its going to cost you to get your hands on it overall 1330  this set is for true collectors only i cant imagine anyone wanting one because they want to play with it it was a great set back in the day but the design feels really dated and if youre wondering mine is not for sale ever all the photos plus more can be found in the gallery	neutral
great job i love reading vintage reviews as it reminds of our childhood days glad to see this in very good condition by the way i will move this to lego trains  town to see if thebrickster will like to include this set inside the review index over there i believe he is maintaining vintage town set reviews over there and this suits there well	positive
im sorry you had to move this topic white fang when it was in the reviewers academy the teachers agreed it belonged in other themes shrug i guess it ended up where it belonged eventually	neutral
great review its good to see some of the old sets reviewed i think i learned something about the history of lego from this one	neutral
in 1977 trans or yellow slopes existed already and using them would have made the plane more realistic a third rear wheel would have enhanced playability and design rather than this ugly black round brick its the reason why i voted below average even considering 1977s standards however this set is nice and simple offering good playability	negative
here is the spirit of st louis just go there washington and have a look of this legend  cavannus on jul 15 2009 0940 pm said in 1977 trans or yellow slopes existed already and using them would have made the plane more realistic i dont think so there is no 45Â° slope in the original plane design  and no front cockpit window quote a third rear wheel would have enhanced playability and design rather than this ugly black round brick except that it wouldnt have been the spirit of st louis this set is a great one and i wish id bought it in 77 it is the spirit of the 70ties 	positive

wooow what a set not all that large most defenitely not as sophisticated as the message intercept base from 10 years later but in those this was all a kid need to have hours of fun soooo many great parts on this one technic hoses computers rocket parts trans yellow parts the perfect outpst really it was actually my sister who got this one but it only took an hour before i claimed it edited by snefroe 14 july 2008  1236 pm	positive

hey ebers i got my market street on monday and finished building it last night i know its not such a nice review like yoda did the last times but i hope you enjoy some of the pics first a pic of the complete building the 3 minifigs and i pic of the stairs one of my highlights at this set more pics you can find here my opinion about the set i like this set very much it was really fun to build it im happy that that i got some more cherries and a croissant now sweet  a funny idea is the salad in the one box at the front i think normally its a hairpiece of an exoforce fig i also like the colours of the house the dark blue is sooooo nice i think i have to take more of this soon the lighter blue is also nice this set has really nice details like the stairs or the owl at the entry of the market or the balcony i paid 8999 eur a fair price for a really nice set greetings sandra	positive
thanks for the review my favourite detail is the salad d btw could you exchange the modules and make pics of that id like to see how the building looks with the flat roof instead of the dutch style one im not sure though if the vents on the flat roof makes sense as long as its only used as a garage top  maybe they should be removable as the balconies and such things to make the modularity leading not to weird results other than this in combination with a lot of money and the cafe corner set this really could get me into city 	positive
thanks for the great review sweet now that ive seen the set im afraid im a bit disappointed 8 1 the color combination doesnt really do it for me blue dark blue grey black tan white theyre all mixed together without any over all design 2 is there any interior it doesnt look like it and in any case you can only reach it if you remove the modules hm  now it looks too much of a box 3 there are most certainly some nice ideas in this model and some great parts the best part of the model is the staircase 4 i dont think he spent much time in thinking about the design as apo said the chimneys on top of a garage is kinda weird theres also a gate next to another gate which is weird as well also if this is supposed to ba a grocery then the owner has done a lot to hide it the croissant is nice but next to the brown box with vegies theres nothing that suggests this is a shop 5 the white lamp and the the yellow cylinder are at the same level of the tiles imo it should be above the level of the tiles 6 imo not worth the 90 euro edited by snefroe1 20 june 2007  0903 am	negative
thanks i love the look of this set i love the mix of colours it breaks up the model rather than being a single monotone colour hes used several complimentary colours in order to make up the model i agree i think the chimneys on the flat roof is weird ontop of the garage but not so weird one you place it ontop of the building i guess hes done it to give us the choice of roofs and chimneys you can always remove the ones you dont like he also seems to have screwed up a bit on the tiling for the sidewalk on the side module on cafe corner and the building module of this set the sidewalk has the pattern light grey 1x6 at the front then dark grey 1x2 next then dark grey 2x2s however on this hes put the 2x2 tiles first then the 1x2s at the back easilly fixable though overall i love this set thanks for the pics compliments cafe corner perfectly	positive
hi thanks for posting those great pictures i got the cc some time ago and i really looking forward to get my hands on the market street i think the colour scheme of this set is great maybe because blue is my favourite colour just check my wardrobe i really like the design of the roof and the staircase i am not so sure if i like the gateways but i believe they will grow on me when i get the set myself snefroe1 on jun 20 2007 0902 am said 5 the white lamp and the the yellow cylinder are at the same level of the tiles imo it should be above the level of the tiles i am totally agree with snefreo1 the yellow cylinder and the lamppost should be on a level above the tiles actually i have put a 2x2 plat under the lamppost on my cc looks much better if you ask me unfortunately shop at home does not send to norway so i have to purchase this set in billund yes i am going to legoland this summer or on ebay	positive

im not much of a city fan but this looks great i guess this is the closest we can get to legoland miniland quality sets and considering this is a three floro small structure and its over 1000 parts just imagine pun not intended how many peices are in ll californias empire state building or wtc freedom tower models both are large and in real scale over 100 floors thats a lot of bricks anyways ive got a friend who loves city im sure this one would make a great addition to his town setup gotta tell him about this new set y	positive

well now that i have some money a trip to toysrus was obviously in my future especially since my local tru has much of the summer 2007 lineup when i got there almost all the smaller castle sets had been sold out but there was one left the one i am now reviewing for both eurobricks and bzpower  the box well for starters the castle theme boxes are beautiful the blended clear and stormy skies give a great clash of the titans effect and the action poses help as well  the back is equally nice featuring a photo showing kids how to use the crossbow and the brave axe wielder taking a swipe at the skeleton foolish soldier that wont work on skellies see later on in the review to find out why and of course we have a small box with the link to the official lego website where tlc can advertise even more lego sets p the contents after opening the box a single bag of pieces with a couple loose ones the instruction manual and necessary catalog  p  and a new wider rubber band holder spilt out the instruction manual is clear as a bell no color trouble here folks also its worth mentioning the nice background with the mountain and kings castle silhouettes  sorry that theres no picture but ill take one if someone wants to see it  the pieces for being a 5 dollar set well seven in my case darn your above average prices tru crossbow attack features a lot of nice pieces as does the entire castle lineup notable elements include two large brown spoked wheels two brown modified 1x1s a pearl gold slope end and six dark blue modified 1x1x23 slopes the bulk of the pieces however are nothing special ill let the picture do the talking for this the accessories are by far the best parts in this kit two different helmets in a beautiful shiny silver are my favorite but i also really like the scythe looks good for mocing and the round shield  wub  which are both brand new parts and can anyone not love the classic axe and crossbows oh and theres a black lightsaber too but thats rather boring compared to the other parts p the minifigures can you say four figures including the horse that has to be a record for a regular 5 dollar set at least in the present age of limited figures per set well start out with the two crown militia a regular soldier and an archer both have old faces but they look spiffy with the shiny helmets and the superb torsos ill name the soldier bravo the stout and the archer angler the precise for future references now we come to the skellie although some people dislike the new skeleton design i personally prefer it to the old ones since the arms are now poseable and the face much meaner the only problem is that the arms hang too low but its not too noticeable when they have weapons in their hands and last but not least heres the elusive skeleton horse i for one am very happy that tlc took advantage of that awesome prototype piece and made it into an official massproduction mold however the horse is unfortunately one piece but since regular lego horses are as well i dont have a problem with it i do have a problem with the pose however the legs are in quite an odd position and i wonder why tlc didnt make the front and back leg poses symmetrical ah well the finished set i have only two pictures here since this set is so small first heres the completed crossbow i must say finally no more ridiculous horse mounted catapults or crazy fire wheel launchers now we have realistic siege weapons including the one included with 7090 plus it actually launches okay although not the best heres the other main attraction the completed skeleton rider and horse i think its rather dramatic with that pose and the dark background dont you think  playability okay so theres not much in this set but a bit of imagination brings plenty of possibilities to show you what you can do heres a little story made only with this set  overall rating presentation 910 pieces 810 minifigures 910 finished model 810 playability 810  final score 8410 crossbow attack is a fine introduction into castle so i recommend it to any lego fan whether they are a castle nut or just want a cheap change of pace tlc has a knack with making great small kits these days and i more than ever support them in their amazing rebound from their dark ages between 1997 and 2004  edited by kimt 10 august 2008  0133 pm	positive
thanks for this review and that great little comic about the skellies though xd you have to admit that besides their long arms making the skellie legs look out of proportion that theyre just made poorly theyre sticking straight out as opposed to every other fig which have a slight bend to make them look more natural also as im sure youve noticed the pegs are on angles that makes it impossible for them to hold their weapons straight and they cant even put their arms over their heads without stressing the plastic some i mean theyre dead well at least undead theyre not supposed to be stiff and personally i like the ragdoll look more it makes them seem more dead p	negative
a very nice review with good pictures thanks grevious y and undead ragdolls on p	positive
excellent photographs and i like the comic too i dont care what anyone says i love the new skeletons skull	positive
nice review and great little story d y look at the normal horses their legs are positioned like that too only the skellie horses legs are touching so as to strengthen the middle otherwise it could easily snap in half also i think the new skeletons are nice their head is awesome i just dont see why tlc couldnt make the bent droid arms with the hand facing vertically instead of making a new arm design completely straight	positive
nice review and a great story also grevious this is a great set and a nice little army builder one at that the only thing that saddens me about the line itself is the new arms on the skelies they just look far to big when placed next to a normal fig for me the old versions of the skelies were far better why tlc changed to this is beyond me still i shall be buying alot of these sets just to increase my army	positive
tks a lot grevious for this  regarding the set i just love it  i really oved your comic it was really well done and hilarious xd eb spirit on  vader on jul 2 2007 0828 am said still i shall be buying alot of these sets just to increase my army you dont say mate i bought like 10 or so so far xd medieval yoda	positive

tks a lot for your review ickelpete  i saw that set at tru a couple of weeks ago but was really not interested due to the design  i am not a fan of those motorized lego sets  i guess the lime colour is to please kids as well as the general design far from a real dino  i am sure that its going to sell well to a younger croud let me quote you here quote the walking motion works well although there is no steering and it will fall over it it encounters obstacles hum i really hope it works welll because i will have to buy that motorized atat and i dont want it to crash p yoda	neutral
ickelpete on jul 9 2007 1119 pm said first lets start with the box which is much larger than it needs to be pete no lego box is too big my friend xd  nice review y as for the set i dont like the colors myself surprised xd  and it seems a little blocky otherwise the set is cool i really like the head	positive
i bought this set last night and it is great my biggest surprise was the wheels that were included i didnt even know they existed and there arent even that new back to the set he is such a cute dinosaur d since he is so tubby i think he looks like a baby i suspect my wife wanted him more than me my biggest interest in the set was to have more motors and ir parts so i could make an ir car overall i highly recomend this set but as others have said be warned that the box is very oversized i wish lego would give up on this whole 11 picture thing wacko	positive
thanks for the nice review its butt ugly to me but the motors  ir control seem pretty neat  even at that high price it looks like a good parts pack  sweet	positive

ickelpete on jul 13 2007 1106 pm said great review dunamis i hope you have as much fun with this as i have one point yes they are new axles they have appeared in a few sets this year yes the kids seem to love it as you pointed out and the wife still thinks i am crazy so its all good i read your review after i posted mine seems like we shared the same thoughts on a majority of it i always think it is good to have multiple opinions on sets as it gives the community more data points to evaluate a given set	positive
i already made my 5 cents to this horrible colour bastard x x x in ickelpetes thread but i wanted to clarify about this dunamis on jul 13 2007 1041 pm said finally ive never seen one of these before although someone will no doubt rattle off a dozen sets where you can find this part in about 5 seconds heres one of the sets its included in it didnt even take me 5 seconds  p	negative
thanks for the bonus review i am still on the fence with this one so every opinion is good dunamis on jul 14 2007 0741 am said but what about the atat in case you dont know the atat in the dark side development kit had a single motor and a moving head it worked by the head simply swinging from side to side due to balence shifts i suspect the atat will be same i also think that there will be no remote for it either edited by sinner 14 july 2007  1131 am	positive

i kind of like the design of this but more importantly i really want to get my hands on the power functions motors and ir control system id prefer the 8275 technic bulldozer but theres no way i can stretch to the 100 price tag so i was thinking i would have to see if i could get a 4958 monster dino cheap in the january sales then two things happened today firstly i saw the dino in tescos reduced from 70 to 55 then my wife said shed buy it for me for christmas wow thats never happened to me before i love my wife wub cant wait till christmas now	positive

this is both my first set review and post about a star wars set even though i have been collecting them since 99 i got this one early this year so i thought i would post a review on it please bare with me i am not a great photographer so with that in mind here goes front of the box 75083 atdp boxfront by whitesidewjw on flickr back of the box 75083 atdp box back by whitesidewjw on flickr shot of the bags 75083 atdp bags by whitesidewjw on flickr the sticker sheet i normally dont apply them but for this i am going ahead and putting them on 75083 atdp sticker sheet by whitesidewjw on flickr minifigs i really like the two atdp pilots but the best agent kallus really does shine of course we get an extra stormtrooper 75083 atdp minifigs by whitesidewjw on flickr no new molds in this as far as i can tell however these printed 4x4 domes are really great i can see lots of uses for these in space mocs 75083 atdp new printed elements by whitesidewjw on flickr bag1 complete nothing earth shattering here an easy build 75083 atdp bag 1 complete by whitesidewjw on flickr bag 2 complete 75083 atdp bag 2 complete cockpit seats by whitesidewjw on flickr cockpit assembly 75083 atdp cockpit assembly by whitesidewjw on flickr bag 2 complete 75083 atdp bag3 complete by whitesidewjw on flickr foot assembly i like how they positioned the slopes 75083 atdp foot assembly by whitesidewjw on flickr complete atdp 75083 atdp complete by whitesidewjw on flickr complete atdpside view 75083 atdp side view complete by whitesidewjw on flickr complete atdp over view 75083 atdp complete overview by whitesidewjw on flickr complete atdp rear view 75083 atdp rear view by whitesidewjw on flickr extra pieces 75083 atdp extra pieces by whitesidewjw on flickr the verdict minifigs 55 we get a total of four figs i like the two atdp pilots and agent kallus is a well done minifig i can complain about another storm trooper either parts 35 other than the dome pieces i commented on before there is really not any new parts in this if you build space star wars or machinery this will still be a welcome assortment experience of build 45 this really was a fun build it came together fast but was challenging enough for its target age group playability 55 this thing is much more sturdy than it looks the legs take a little bit of effort due to the double locking hinges but hold together very wellthis is a very minor complaint value 45 typical 4999 for 500 pieces i must admit i paid a little more than msrp due to shipping but i cant complain about the value overall 2125 i really believe this is one of the best walkers that lego has designed the only changes i would make would be adding real control panels in the cockpit and it would be nice if lego made a real widow to fit in with these types of builds rather than a transparent tile over another plate all in all i would recommend this set and i hope the rest of the 2015 star wars sets are on par with this	positive
great review thanks for doing it im a big fan of this set the minifigures are good as is the parts selection i like the piece used in the cockpit to secure the minifigure in place i wouldve liked to see some panels in the cockpit though rather than translucent red pieces that said however they are useful pieces	positive
thanks for the review cannot wait for the 2015 sets	positive
pretty good first review this looks pretty great i probably wont be getting it due to budget constraints bionicle but still very nice set to me it kinda looks like the missing link between when the atst evolved into the atat also i know the rebels stormtroopers get a lot of hate but i really like them thanks for the review	positive
thanks for the review i have two questions  what is the driver standing on when the hatch is open and he is looking out  could you show the face of kallus without helmet please my only complaint is that the colours of both kalluss and the driverss uniforms are wrong kalluss uniform is way too dark and should be more dark olive than black and the driverss uniforms are too bright and should be more greyish compared to what we saw in the series	neutral
great first review as a huge walker fan its great to get one thats not a redesign or one of those tiny battlepack vechicles	positive
awesome i am really looking forward to buy this but is it really 5000 us i was hoping more around 3000 also i was wondering how the hip section for the legs work does it have a stiff turning axis to it	positive
i built this set and i think the two rubber pieces holding the both sides of the face is a bit stretched out therefore making the set somewhat tight for entire top hatch to open and close does anyone have the same situation is this right  never mind i got it i built the back a stud too long edited by namioik 29 december 2014  0304 am	neutral

firstly great review  i was really on the fence on this one this review has greatly changed my view on this modular a definite buy for me love the interiors and the whole concept the more i see it the more i see the little features which put this set apart or at least slightly different from the others of course great playability for the younger lot and i think a nice building to give any lego city more character and colour	positive
wow that is the best start to a review i have ever seen great job oky amazing set ill be picking it up this weekend	positive

legos affiliation with six wheelers go back a long way i think the first one was released in 1981 more than 25 years ago this year lego added another one to the family mars missions rhino 1 as its title sounds its been a while since ive bought and opened a large box so maybe this isnt a surprise to most of you but the box does not open at the front as with many larger sw boxes but at the side the two printed sealsor whatever people call them have gone as well being replaced by one larger print in the middle of side the box also isnt as thick as a large sw box like the sandcrawler the general size is however still quite large pict0001jpg 28191k 102 downloads the back side shows the mars mission theme sets eccept the rhino i guess it shows this set will be released as a tru exclusive or something only to show up in legoland shops and maybe lego shops its a shame really because this is by far the best set of the theme pict0002jpg 28542k 89 downloads when you open the front cover you see a larger picture picture of the rhino obviously it seems to be some sort of multifunctional truck i think the basic function is to drive around and explore for that it has a drilling device and six giant wheels pict0003jpg 2737k 82 downloads the set comes with two instruction books im afraid to say they did not resolve the grayblack colors issue colorwise the real thing does not look like the instruction book because of it pict0004jpg 30263k 75 downloads the rhino looks really big because of the six giant wheels i guess its more or less the same size as mtrons magnetiser with the big difference between the two being that the wheels have been turned around creating a unique wheel design for a lego model pict0285jpg 29059k 83 downloads pict0277jpg 28626k 80 downloads the wheels look very cool even though the first couple of wheels stand a bit closer to each other dont know why that is hm  and they could have used a bit more body but the design is pretty good i know armagheddon isnt far away  pict0292jpg 21675k 70 downloads the suspension of the wheels is a bit flimsy sure it allows the truck to move around in a more realistic way than the old sets but its not as flexible as some older sets like sws ctt nor do the wheels have much body the black bars you see on top of the wheels are more window dressing then functional pict0293jpg 24478k 88 downloads the over all shape of the rhino is kinda bulky it looks more like a beatle than a rhino if youre asking me it has three major sections but i wouldnt call it a modular building though the cockpit is the first section its spacious and detailed pict0290jpg 26277k 0 downloads pict0291jpg 29975k 87 downloads the cockpit hangs down from a weird angle its attached to a large vertical technic brick that is part of the rhinos main structure so its not a seperate spaceship which is a shame oh well you cant have it all i guess pict0301jpg 29113k 78 downloads ah yes stickers all over the place but theyre cool the mid section of the rhino dominates the basic shape of the model its as if those two large white parts form a strong and thick shield protecting whatever is inside from whatever is outsde pict0007jpg 21322k 67 downloads unfortunately there is nothing inside its extra space needed to house the spaceship thats really a shame a command center of some kind could have given the rhino a bit more panache pict0286jpg 25135k 87 downloads however whats really great is the way in which they fit together one side has an orange 1x2 plate that fits in between two white 1x3 plates of the other side creating yet another unique shape for a lego model but again its a shame they didnt do more with this section xo pict0283jpg 28775k 82 downloads the third and last section is a platform for a space ship pict0299jpg 2895k 77 downloads pict0287jpg 19978k 75 downloads the platform itself isnt really special no details no stickers its just a skeleton to carry the spaceship nothing more nothing less no your space ship doesnt fall off even if you rotate the platform into a launch position pushing the weight of the ship backwards in fact the position of the ship onto the platform is so solid its kinda difficult to imagine how this ship flies off  the ship on the other hand is pretty cool its all sorts of things at the same time it seems it transports two aliens but also a small car

shuttle and i think it needs some modding but i do think it looks pretty nice sure the cockpit is a bit too low a pilot needs to lay down instead of sitting down and the dropping mechnism if there is one at all isnt all that brilliant either the main structure is a bit too technical for me i prefer actual parts with studs not these lego technic bars and pins pict0006jpg 22443k 74 downloads the crew pict0276jpg 23943k 70 downloads ah yes theres also this green plastic residu think they are supposed to be the aliens and theres also this weird alien craft but i didnt bother to build that sad good wub great innovative design lots of potential i even like the colors sweet lots of playability its a big attractive model i dont see any weak spots in the design that could compromise stability or structural integrity not so good  too many technic parts some sections on the model like the gun and the drilling device are a bit to flimsy id say 758510 price 750 danish crowns about 105euro	positive
seems like they infuse system sets with more technic bars must be that technic isnt selling too well and they want to educate ppl how cool technic can be p its quite apparent when even the small bike needed technic frame	neutral
natelite on jul 15 2007 1220 pm said seems like they infuse system sets with more technic bars must be that technic isnt selling too well and they want to educate ppl how cool technic can be p its quite apparent when even the small bike needed technic frame my guess its less expensive and complicated to produce theyre also using these parts in other themes so in the end theyre producing a smaller catalog of bricks but every part gets produced in larger quantities	neutral
this is a great review and so is the set y i thought i would buy it but when i saw the price i changed my mind xd i always liked flying things better though like the dropship although that is a bit pricey too i guess xd	neutral
this set is truely incredible a must have but this set is also incredibly overpriced n  com on its only a big vehicle  nothing really special to justify the near 100 price tag this set is clearly worth something like 65 at max look at the incredible dropship for 34 thats a good value for money y edited by mutex 15 july 2007  0457 pm	neutral

nice review y i have quick question though do the crystals fit into the aliens hands try and stick one in therebecuase the new catalog shows an image of an alien holding a crystal lastly lego should have made the aliens with movable arms and no hole in the middle  i dont want to waste any money so i am only going to grab 1 or 2 of the smaller sets piranha editimo the aliens would win becuase they have superior technology and all they do is have to cut the airtank line and the humans die edited by piranha 20 july 2007  0140 am	positive
yes they can hold the crystals they cant move the hands    but they do have the clawlike hand of the droid arm edit could you post some general beauty pics of the rhino and the attached craft such as front side back etc all we have of the ship is one top pic edited by mr mandalorian 20 july 2007  0518 am	positive
say i was looking at your pics and then at the instructions and i just realised  havent you put the stikers on the shield thingies in the middle upside down i think you did d i dont know if i like those new sets though i mean they have great shapes and potential but at the same time they seem so holey theyre really huge and big but full of empty air and space as well well this one not as much and indeed it is the best looking set of the lot though but i dont think ill go into that line	neutral
snefroe1 on jul 16 2007 0719 am said ok then ill do that later on but i will not touch that plastic residu xd you touched them to put them in their holders in the ship so in theory you will not review them anyways nice review i dont think ill get this though im trying to decide between this moble devastator or anothe 90 set i need to get something large before my bday regards vbbn	positive
great review wonderfully detailed dont care for the ship at all its that technic under a hollow shell thing like the ctt if it wasnt for the figures i would have hated it and nothing about these figures excites me ill end up finding the least number of sets possible to provide at least one of each figure for the general population collection and skip the rest unless they do as i expect and flop here thus leading to huge discounts i like this set  at half off 	positive
the life on mars theme was so much better with the aliens dominating mars instead of the humans and the aliens were so much better with their own names etc good times anyway i think this is the best set in the series it looks so neat and reminds me of the pelican form halo xd edited by iamded 31 august 2007  0511 am	positive
i think the life on mars series was great although i didnt click until the line was gone that the red hangar on the alien base was for the red mech and same with the blue one man i was gutted when i realised that i want those mechs however the base was great with the small mech and the flying crafts could the lom mechs have been the spark of life for exoforce 8 edited by iamded 31 august 2007  0515 am	positive
two of my daughters are building this as we speak i agree the design is a lot smaller than i would have liked but theyre loving it no question the figures are the real draw here and at 6 and almost five years old theyre doimg a good job building so far at least for the 46 range in my house this set is a home run thanks for the great review mostlytechnic	positive
i managed to get two sets for my twin girls for christmas and would have to agree with your ratings the anna and elsa figs are indeed excellent	neutral
very nice review mostlytechinc once i saw this set i was interested in it for the colours and piecesthanks for this review to shed more light onto it	positive
thanks for the review mostlytechnic i too wish they had done a real castle for this set it certainly deserved it my sons and i figure they could have used the old rock monster mold from rock raiders in white for the missing snow beast i will pick it up though for the figs and unique pieces	positive
thanks for the review i have the same opinion about the design looks like belville i bought it on legostore orlando december 30th it was impressive my wife saw them putting on shelf 8 or 10 boxes she ran and grabbed the last one the girls faces around it was indescribable mix of ecstasy and afraid to loose it it happened in less than 2 minutes my 7 yo girl didnt want it she likes the dresses but hates the movie prefers lego movie but my 2 yo girl who never saw the movie grabbed it for good and we bought it lego will sell it like water but i do not understand why a set so small it is the worst set design since the introduction of lego friends my 7 yo has more than 50 lego friends minifigures all the lego fiends stores and concluded that the castle had a terrible design she is 7 lets be honest lego should have released this sets months before this christmas and is loosing a perfect opportunity to sell a decent set with much more pieces i am wondering if they are going to make another set with the same characters at the end it is just for the minifigures	negative
yep my family all thinks they should have made a bigger set added figs and just been printing money this feels massively rushed into production which is weird the other princess sets that just came out look worlds better	negative
i wish elsa had more of a white hairpiece rather than blonde but it could be worse not a bad set overall although olaf doesnt look right without the twigs on his head anna is a really nice and accurate fig	positive
the review is very well done thanks i dont know the movie my key question is whether the bricks in the set will allow to build my own snowice creations now with transglitter being part of the design approach i am not so sure can those who have already bought it tell me can transglitter be used as transparent with snow particles or is it just terrible i cannot really tell from the review pic above	neutral
i think the transglitter blue panels can be icy or snowy just fine im sure thats why they used them for this set now if youre looking for realism like the photos in your sig seem to be it might be tougher but ive been thinking about using those big glittery panels to make a waterfalltype scene	positive
im literally of the exact opposite opinion to op here i love the structure and the parts this is a fantastic little parts pack that ill be snagging more of when i find it againbut ive no use for the figures not a big disney princess fan its all about the parts this set is freaking amazing d	positive
there is a very simple reason for the flowers and greenleaved trees you should remember from the movie it was actually summer when elsa set of the eternal winter… the orange flowers do bother me from a design point of view i would have liked it better if they were a pinkpurplebluewhite color same goes for the leafy bits they could have used the pinkpurple ones they are gonna use in the elves sets it would have been fantastic if they had given us white leafy bits like snow covered branches im sure loads of us could use those in our mocs edited by bennemans 13 january 2015  0614 pm	neutral
hello everyone i am back to share with all of you another of my legends of chima polybags review it will be pretty comprehensive since the finished built will be quick and will be focusing more of what kind of fun that you can derive from there this polybag was bought in september 2013 when i visited legoland malaysia and i did not hesitate to put this in my shopping basket name 30253 leonidas jungle dragster theme lego system  legends of chima year 2013 pieces 30 minifigs 1 minifigure price usd na gbp na euro na sgd na resources brickset bricklink an original polybag image of the 30253 leonidas jungle dragster back view of the original polybag image of the 30253 leonidas jungle dragster the road scout of the lions tribe this polybag design is definitely plan to be the quickest and fastest dragster to recce enemy front by making a swift scout for the lions tribe i believe by the sound of the name jungle dragster it might just be suitable to use in jungle terrain well i dont quite agree that this is a dragster even though it has the kind of open view concept of rolling in fast but it does not have the length of a typical dragster similar to this town polybag design for example still it is nice to have smaller variants of their vehicular supremacy instruction manual front instruction manual back the lego building content with just 30 lego elements you can be pretty quick to be able to display these laid out content after the built is completed these are the remaining spare parts i am fond of the wheels which are some useful parts other than that there are nothing spectacular about it my name is leonidas and i belonged to the lions tribe do not be mistaken of his name leonidas to be the king of sparta who led the brave men of 300 spartans warriors to fight to the death against the persians instead this character is based on the bio resided in legocom you will realise that he is aligned with the lions tribe and is a proud lion footsoldier he may have that goofy idiotic look but he can be very serious in his commitment to discharging his duties you are able to observe his nice back view printing which reveal his black and blue sash leonidas has a dual facial feature to reveal his much serious appearance leonidas is one of the common characters available in the legends of chima universe it can be found in a total of five sets it is a great pity that there is no weapon being made for him in this polybag design which will certainly make a fine addition the completed built of the jungle dragster this is the main design of the jungle dragster which is very simple looking there is no distinct fighting capability from the vehicular design and it look just like a regular patrol vehicle one thing i like about this is the close distinct colour schema of the lions tribe other than that there is nothing special about it moving off with my jungle dragster to conclude this polybag is really meant for lego fans or collectors who appreciate legends of chima or wanting to sample the legends of chima theme it is a very simple built but yet could form a decent force size for recce purposes before sending in the big arsenals to whack their enemies either way i will only suggest you to buy it if you really love this theme at an inexpensive price otherwise it is perfectly alright to give this a miss summary review playability 410 you need to have more lions tribe vehicles in order to bring the best and fun out of it since this is more of a supporting vehicle design 410 simplistic built of the dragster and main focus is just acquiring the minifigure price 410 bought at about usd7 which is not an awesome price so get it if you can get it more than half of this price overall 410 if only you are a huge mega fan of the legends of chima then you need to get this i gave it a 2 based on my review score card what about yours i hope every one of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine comments and criticisms are strongly welcomed pictures can be found in my flickr	negative

when i first saw pics of the biplane i wasnt sure if i liked it or not but after seeing it in more detail i gotta say i love the thing wub its a great plane with so many good aspects its also the perfect counter vehicle for the new batplane for me though the best part of the set has got to be the new pumpkin heads those are just beautiful and i cant wait to get lots of them	positive

hinckley39 on jul 19 2007 1259 pm said wait what are you saying you prefer the joel schumacher films sorry due to my convoluted sentance structure you misinterpretted me i meant that joel shumakers movies fall well within the category of being against the idea that batman is as big a loon as the guys that he hauls in just to be sure i hate x the joel schumaker batman movies hinckley39 on jul 19 2007 1259 pm said no no no no i saw a movie once im pretty sure its a wallabee ill get back to you at christmas it is possible i made a mistake hinckley39 on jul 19 2007 1259 pm said im deeply concerned about price differences in other countries it seems pretty ridiculous and counterproductive for tlc has anyone posted about this in the embassy forum yes i also wrote to lego about it and i posted their reply	neutral
hinckley39 on jul 19 2007 0524 am said people are entitled to their opinions but the opinion that the joel schumacher batman films are any good is just wrong and stupid p they werent that bad if anything the new film is the best one and it didnt irreparably kill the baddie at the end  i love the 60s show even though ive only seen the movie sure it was camp not batman and often ridiculous but so what that was the charm besides its the comics that rule so there holy opinions batman d	neutral
what about the cartoon batman the animated series will always be the definitive batman to me the two tim burton movies were okay they havent aged well though and i really dig what christopher nolan is doing with the new movies christian bale did a fine job in batman begins  but when i watch the movie i hear kevin conroys voice in my head the cartoon rocked and as much as i enjoyed the justice league unlimited cartoon my biggest complaint was always more batman please	neutral

7665 review part 2 the second half of the build goes quicker than the first once you start to add the engines the ship really begins to take shape the main body of the ship has a few surprises hidden away under a removable cover inside you get some retracting guns a storage box a little shuttle and space for a droid and figure here is everything you can fit inside the guns are concealed behind the side vents pushing them forward causes the vents to open closed and open the final feature is the passenger areaescape pod inside is plenty of space for two figures the pod cleverly attaches by pushing the front section of the ship forward sliding the pod in then returning the front everything locks together and is held securely in place by an elastic band  heres a couple of pictures of the final model its not the most beautiful creation ever but it is an excellent representation of the ship from the film the angular shape actually suits a lego build well theres one more useful feature the whole ship can be safely and comfortably picked up by two ball ended technic pins towards the back end it balances well at this point and does allow you to swoosh the ship around much more easily this was the most enjoyable star wars build ive had in a long time everything progresses nicely with almost no repetitive bits the ship looks good and is also huge sweet compare it to the 6211 isd and youll see its only fractionally smaller when i first saw pictures of this on the internet i thought it looked ok once you see it for real it is much more impressive for 6999 in the uk im not complaining its the best value star wars set of the year so far to conclude pieces 910 minifigures 710 would be a 9 apart from the stupid quigonobiwan head error playability 810 originality 910 set design 810 overall 8210 the box says this is a limited edition set whatever that means so if youre planning to get it id suggest you grab it at the first opportunity im glad i did xd edited by kernow 22 july 2007  1056 pm	positive

brick miner on jul 31 2007 0746 pm said as for the set the thing that jumps out at me most is the use of dark blue for water im so used to seeing the classic blue for water that the dark blue seems weird i dont like it  bm indeed i only noticed this when i saw the sh images i guees that theyre on dark waters you can always put some trans blue and trans clear 1x1 round plates no i tried that technique to make the lava using trans red and trans orange plates it looks neat regarding the human soldier thing yoda mentioned its quite weird like him im going to swap the legs so theyre coherent with the soldiers from the other sets third note is it just me or did you attach the two black gate pieces too high shakar	neutral

shakar on aug 1 2007 0134 pm said third note is it just me or did you attach the two black gate pieces too high shakar no i think this is correct the upper plate with clip for the door is a little high on top of a dark gray 1x1 brick so if you want the door to operate well you have to place it like that i just put the clip under that brick a very easy fix so my door now is lower which looks better imho and no sneaky skelly can crawl along under it xd	neutral
asuka on aug 1 2007 0147 pm said no i think this is correct the upper plate with clip for the door is a little high on top of a dark gray 1x1 brick so if you want the door to operate well you have to place it like that i just put the clip under that brick a very easy fix so my door now is lower which looks better imho and no sneaky skelly can crawl along under it xd exactly asuka is correct also keep in mind that the picture was taken looking down on the model that is sitting on the carpet it makes the gap appear a little larger in addition for those of you that recommended ironing the sail it worked great i set the iron to low and used a tshirt to protect the sail it flattened it out perfectly in fact it worked so well that i did the same with my old ww weapons wagon cover that has gotten wrinkled over the years the iron worked perfectly	positive
yes that was definately an optic illusion looking at it again the gap looks a lot shorter thanks  shakar	positive
yes very nice review mr brickster i think i  for a change like the castle part better the ship doesnt look quite right to me if theyre gonna make a pirate theme with ships like this i wouldnt be very happy but i think the ship brings some nice accesories like the anchor a black mid piece steering wheel etc i think ill buy it eventually wout on aug 1 2007 0819 pm said nice review i like the buildingport the most mmmdark blue plates wub pity it is a toysrus exclusive in the netherlands there are only toysrusses in the greater cities ah thats good to know now i wont be searching in other toystores as well thanks mr tiber	positive

ok here is the set alot of us star wars fans have been waiting for the 7666 hoth rebel base wub first the box now the great minifigs that stunning k3po fig now the snowspeeder aaaaggghhhhh these parts are all stickers now for the turret the 2 cones on the side press in to fire out 2 blue lights saber blades d now for the small crane thingy yes the part under the engine on the snowspeeder is another sticker 8 echo base well the front door anyway d  the main control room d again these are stickers on a tinted clear panel and on the slope  i have no idea what this is meant to be d finally 2 shots of the full set wub well over all i really like this set and think it is great value for money the minifigs alone would set you back more than the cost of this set the build time was a good 2 hours or so and was good fun the snowspeeder is not as good as the second snowspeeder and no where near as good as the first in my opinion but i did love that first one the k3po fig is perfect and it is good to be getting more droids that arent r2d2 and c3po it is a shame about the stickers but that is the price of keeping the cost down i suppose the only printed part in the whole set is the snowspeederxwing windscreen i will definately be getting atleast another 3 of this great set 910	positive

excellent set the snowtroopers are just amazing most lego imperial troops are really good however its sad that except from luke all the rebels have the same face which is what is more the most unexpressive that you can find for the rest the quality looks excellent the snowspeeder is far better than the first they realized but only one thing it looks a bit too white to me i think i remember they were grey and orange rather than white in the film and the echo base door is really cool really nice set edited by lord beckett 02 august 2007  0414 pm	positive

review  42039  24 hours race car introduction when the preliminary images of the le mans racer surfaced somewhere last year 2014 it got a lot of praise this changed dramatically when the final images of the 24 hours race car showed up the front side of the car especially the head lights and the curvature of the side of car had changed a lot the car obviously still resembled the prototype but the new design raised a lot of eyebrows the new design was considered a step back instead of forward eventhough i still liked the design i must admit i liked the earlier design better too with the emphasis on past tense liked i am not sure anymore and this review will show you why like the arctic truck this set has a bmodel which is well worth checking out thats why this review includes both the amodel and bmodel for people who are on the fence the bmodel might actually convince them to buy the set after all lets see what this set is all about note all images can be clicked for hires

motion of the car the lower right section shows the dimensions of the model upon completion it will measure a length of 40cm and a width of 18 cm the back like the front the back side has exactly the same setup as the box of the arctic truck the top shows the functions of the model while the lower left side shows the bmodel and the lower right side shows the motorization options the picture of the bmodel looks so cool it could be a model of its own at this point i was very eager to build both models and compare them the side one of the sides usually shows a part in 11 scale this time its one of the wheels indicating the size of the model content of the box the box contains 1 booklet 1 sticker sheet 13 bags 4 tires instruction booklet since i own two copies of the set i also received two instruction booklets whats catching my eye is that my second copy is supplied in different packaging than the first one its for the first time that i am aware of that the instruction booklet and stickers come in a sealed bag without cardboard back hopefully this will be a new standard for all sets with sticker sheets instead of multiple booklets this set contains a single square bound book in earlier reviews i have epxressed my preference for a single book i dont see any advantage in having 2 3 or even up to 6 booklets sticker sheet like the actual model the sticker sheet looks very vibrant the bright green white and black color combination has found its way to the stickers as well either you love em or hate em since i started writing reviews i have been applying stickers and i am happy i started doing it stickers do give the model its finishing touch bags with parts thirteen bags with a total of 1219 parts give or take a few are supplied in the densily packed box the rims and flex are sealed in a bag as well sometimes looking at the bags makes you wonder what the logic is behind the distribution of the various parts across the different bags well this time it really got me confused take a look at two of the bags below theres a bag containing all the 3l blue pins then theres a bag with various partsand a single 3l blue pin i figured this might be an error but both of the sets have the same anomaly tires the tires have been supplied unbagged as usual highlighted parts this chapter describes new and interesting parts this set actually contains a lot of them this set also contains an abundance of panels if you arent into panels this isnt the set for you changeover catch this year 2015 the new changeover catch parts were released its a combination of three parts the advantage of the new parts is that the red gear is the same on both sides which avoids mounting it the wrong way around it also avoids the changeover catch slipping out of the driving ring like it used to do you can apply lots of pressure but the catch doesnt slip out pins some of last years new pins are also included in this set 12 x pin with pin hole and 21 x 3l pin with 1l axle securing technic beams can be quite simple with the new pin with pin holes the new 3l pin with 1l axle gives you more possibilities when connecting beams and other parts below are two example situations where the new pins have been used granted the examples below can be accomplished by using other techniques however some predicaments from the past can be easily solved by using these new parts like me you will most likely appreciate the ease of use engine and suspension also included are two steering portal hubs and steering portal hubs with ball joint arms and four steering portal axles for driving and steering the vehicle these parts are commonly used nowadays the picture below also shows some other parts like gear rack steering arms and suspension frames this set comes with a single 5x7 frame and three 5x11 frames panels this set contains a whopping 47 panels in three different colors i personally like panels a lot and i do appreciate the variety we have at our disposal lately this set even contains a new 13x3x2 curved mudguard panel new 13x3x2 curved panel this is the first set to contain the new 13x3x2 curved panel looking at the pictures doesnt do these panels justice in real life they are actually quite big i figured they would be smaller but they are even longer than the 11 x 5 frame with a length of 13 including the attachment points hopefully this part will be available in other colors as well preferably white for adding variety to your ev3 robot 19l white flexaxles the white 19l flex axles have only been released in a single set the 8461 williams f1 racer in 2002 current prices on bricklink are as high as 15 euros needless to say we are very happy with the return of these white axles now we can build jeroen ottens awesome alfa romeo 4c spider for a decent price as well i am really happy that useful rare parts are being used more often by tlg designers part list heres the complete list for all 1219 parts as you can see in the highlighted parts section this set contains a lot of interesting and useful parts if you dont own sets like the 8070  supercar this might be the set to pick up if you want to start building your own supercar the build enough with all the set and part information lets build the model rear suspension the build starts with the rear suspension and drivetrain as you can see in the picture below the length of the axle between the steering cv joint is 4l where it usally is 3l this is an indication that the finished model will be a bit bigger than usual 8070 for example the finished suspension is one of the cleanest suspension setups i have seen in an official model its pretty basic but it works like a charm this setup is defintely worth using in your moc heres a video after attaching the suspension to the frame you rotate the module and secure it at this stage the rear section of the chassis with suspension is almost finished v8 midengine extending the chassis forward results in the picture below where the front spoiler is already visible whats also visible is the v8 engine placed right in front of the rear axle resulting in a midengine setup perfectly suited for sports and race cars two exhaust pipes have been fitted on either side of the engine together with two hoses attaching them to the engine the instructions are easy to follow although you sometimes you need to bend the beams a bit minor improvements are possible here and there but nothing shocking front suspension the front suspension is a bit more complicated than the rear suspension which makes sense considering the fact it contains the steering rack the shock absorbers are placed in a different angle than the rear ones resulting in a somewhat stiffer front suspension all in all the front suspension is well designed and the steering rack can be easily powered with a servo motor the picture belows shows the front suspension attached to the chassis if you follow the official instructions to motorize the model the area in front of the suspension is used to mount the battery box when you are modding this model to make it full rc this area can be used to mount the servo motor gearbox like the gearbox in the 8070 its not used to switch gears powering the drivetrain its used to switch between two functions opening the doors and the hoodbonnet the gearbox is located at the left of the vehicle near the cockpit the mechanism to open the doors is located on the left side while opening the hoodbonnet is taking place at the right side to accomplish this some axles traverse under the cockpit to the other side of the vehicle following the axles to other side of the vehicle and adding some gears results in the situation below the video below shows the gearbox in action door opening mechanism the mechanism to open the door is comprised of some knob wheels links without stoppers and pins with towballs take a look at the doors opening and closing the front using the new mudguards and various other panels you finish the front of the car the front is probably the most controversial part of the car this is caused by the preliminary pictures shown before the release of this car in the early pictures the front of the car had smooth curves and beautiful lines while the final car lost these smooth lines and got a more blocky look in return i must admit that at a first glance the new design lost some of its appeal however this model grew on me pretty rapidly the headlight design can be found in more or less the same way on several real le mans type race cars the rear the rear of the car looks great with the stickers continuing from the mudguards to the panels underneath the spoiler the two exhausts sticking out give some details to the back i absolutely disagree with all the negativity surrounding this car maybe its one of those models which needs to grow on you finished model here it is the finished model i know some of you dont like the looks of the car but i think it looks great the color scheme is outstanding the new for technic bright green parts combined with white and black make this car look very vibrant and colorful i am not a big fan of the green used in the 42008  service truck but i do like this bright green a lot it fits perfectly well with the mindstorms ev3 set the curves on the side of the car are not as smooth as some of us hoped but i still think the car looks more than acceptable from the side the stickers add some nice details to the car giving it that characteristic race car look the model looks great in pictures but it does even look better in real life i love this picture of the front of the car however i do wonder if a dedicated 24 hour le mans racer has the seat and steering positioned offcenter using the good ol google machine i come to the conclusion that they do have centered seating and steering at least the majority of them theres ample space in the cabin which makes me wonder why tlg decided to place the seat offcentered the rear view looks cool too with some of the suspension showing and the two exhaust pipes clearly visible the bottom view is very useful to determine the size of the car in studs it measures approx 59 x 27 studs the chassis looks organized and well designed the engine has been placed close to the ground which is perfect for the weight distribution a low center of gravity improves the handling of the car i really enjoyed building this baby the build is very clean and organized although there are some steps where you need to bend the beams a bit to get things into place seeing the model come to life and seeing it grow to pretty impressive proportions is very satisfying for me it was fun but i reckon kids will go nuts over this set and the build size comparison what became obvious during the build but whats emphasized when you have finished the model is that its quite big the size of the car is pretty impressive the pictures below show the car next to the 42030  volvo l350f the side view emphasizes the size of the car its even longer than the volvo if you dismiss the bucket parts left some parts left nothing out of the ordinary features and functions unlike the bmodel this model doesnt implement any unexpected features the functions it does implement are exactly what you would expect from any car steering hog working fake engine suspension opening doors gullwing style opening bonnethood opening trunk gearbox for switching between functions unfortunately the steering wheel hasnt been linked to the hog hand of god steering mechanism placing the seat in the center would have provided an easy way to link the steering wheel to the steering mechanism its a shame we hardly see actual steering anymore opening the hood actually opens up the entire rear section of the car providing you with easy access to the motor compartment the mechanism to open the hood works properly which results in smooth opening and closing of it the same goes for the gullwing style doors both functions are operated manually and you need to switch with the lever to the left of the cockpit these two functions are also the ones which can be motorized by placing an mmotor near the cockpit and a battery box in the trunk all things considered i think this car offers lots of playability the model is solidly built and the functions are easy to operate id say its pretty safe to let your kids play with it bmodel unlike the amodel the bmodel for this set received almost universal acclaim and i can see why often the bmodel is a pale shadow of its part donor in this case the model looks so good it could be a model of its own it even incorporates a neat feature which actually deserves to be in the amodel theres a lot a variation in the quality of digital building instructions tlg is providing but these ones are of very high quality the picture below shows most of the chassis with suspension fake engine and gearbox in place finished model some concessions have been made but overall the car looks fantastic the black of the roof has been extrapolated from the hood which definitely works for me the rear section of the car feels a bit empty but the panels do cover up most of it so its hardly noticeable the v8 stickers will be upside down if you use the parts from the amodel since i could apply new stickers i have placed them using the proper orientation the bottom of the car shows the chassis its obviously a bit smaller than the amodels chassis features and functions taking the functions into account this model isnt playing second fiddle to the amodel besides the obvious functions like steering opening doors and hood this car features folding fog lights which deserve a better podium than a bmodel steering hog working fake engine suspension opening doors manually opening hoodbonnet manually opening trunk operated by gear folding fog lights operated by gear gearbox used to switch functions fog lights one of the most interesting features of the bmodel are the folding fog lights it almost feels a bit weird that a feature like this is implemented in the bmodel instead of the amodel below are 4 steps showing how the mechanism works i have also included a video the mechanism is somewhat reminiscent of fork mechanism used in the 8109  flatbed truck which has been described in effermans review take a look at the video to the fog lights in action parts left a fair number of parts left which isnt uncommon for a bmodel summary to summarize how i feel about this set you need to take a look at the picture below the combined image reflects the quality of this setor better yetsets you actually get two great models for the price of one you dont like the amodel no problem you can have lots of fun with the bmodel i cant stop playing with the fog lights its mesmarizing the color scheme on both models is outstanding i simply cant emphasize enough how well this color scheme pleases the eye the regular green is dull and boring but this bright green really pops out especially when combined with black and white and possibly some red details black white and a little red sounds familiar yes bright green can easily be combined with your ev3 robots so while you are combining the bright green with your robot why not use the great new curved mudguard panels these new panels are introduced in this set and they look great they open up a lot of possibilities in the design department the build of the amodel is outstanding it is fairly simple but since its so clean i really enjoyed it a lot i think the build should be entertaining which doesnt mean it needs to be a real challenge and lets be honest when is a build really challenging the rear suspension is a good example of why i liked the build its very simple yet very effective works like a charm the same goes for the other functions in both models and the star of the entire show can be found in the bmodel hows that for a surprise being aware of the fact that i like this model a lot better than most of you seem to do i really encourage you to give this model a chance the sheer size is impressive the color scheme is awesome and you get a bonus model which is actually worth building score okay so how do i grade this set 8 design open to debate but i like it a lot 8 building experience fun and clean build 9 features superb function in bmodel steels the show 9 playability both models offer lots of playability 8 parts lots of new parts and cool existing parts 10 value for money two models for the price of one 87 twice the fun i hope you enjoyed this review

outstanding review jim congrats  love the pictures so clean and crisp  hope to see many more of your reviews as for the set after seeing this review i kind of like it if i will find it at a decent price i will get it for sure	positive
jim great review as always you convinced me to get this one of these days although not a to priority any comments on which functions can be converted to pf and how well they work	positive
thanks for a great review ive got a pile of tru and lego credit i wanna spend and was thinking about getting this since i got a sneak peak of your review in the academy but its not here in the us yet too bad wonder when itll hit i do disagree about the manuals though i find the thinner stapled manuals easier to use than single large squarebound ones since they lay flatter when open have any links to the prelim photos of the front end i dont remember seeing that and was curious how different it looked	positive

great review jim and stunning pictures	positive
i think this set will be my next purchase i love the color scheme and indeed it looks like a nice set also 1200 parts for eur 100 is not a bad deal and yes the looks of the car have really grown on my since the first official pictures appeared im curious how the bright green will work combined with other colors than white i really hope more sets in the future will use the color so that more different parts will be available over time i think im the only person on eurobricks who doesnt like the looks of the b model but i appreciate the extra functionality it offers besides the set itself i think this is one of the best reviews i have read in a while great job on the superb photographs which i think are essential to a review and the extensiveness of it all you really touched every subject which is great d	positive
i think i read somewhere that the us will not get this set or the motorcycle until august 2015 that means the flagship most likely wont be in august but even later in the year nothing bricklink cant solve though	neutral
fantastic review jim from the quality of the review alone it is easy to see how much hard work you have put into it im with you on the instruction manual i much prefer one quality bound book over umpteen stapled booklets already have 2 of these sitting in the build queue one for display model as im a fan of this one and one to build the b model then dissemble for parts so im already sold on his set but still very much enjoyed taking the time it deserves to read through the review and ogle at your pro photography	positive
great review with fantastic pictures as for the model im glad that they chose to make it less pretty  real le mans prototypes are rarely a sight to behold it is function and aerodynamics over form i would however have preferred more realism for the sake of learning  the front shouldnt open like that  instead it should be easy to remove the whole front cover leaving the suspension easy to work on  the aero seems to be realistic except for the rear end where theres no indication of a venturi channel this should have been easy to include  there is no fuel tank nor fixed fuel connector right behind the cabin  there are no air jacks seriously this is one of the most unique features of a race car like this and lego forgot about them instead they automated two functions which are manual on a real race car  the top cars at le mans are hybrids with ingenious systems i would have loved to see the front wheels connected to some kind of spinning apparatus indicating a kinetic energy recovery system if i get this set im going to make some modifications	positive
i was very skeptical of this set because i really thought the redesign degraded the looks of the amodel a lot but after building it i must say this is an excellent set good job tlg	positive
im still not a huge fan of the model but this is one awesome review the effort and quality can be clearly seen and i hope you continue making reviews like this	positive
great review i think it look like a great set both a and b however the panels are the only thing i would need but still a great looking set	positive
great review jim i have been sitting on the fence about if i will get this set for a while but i saw one built for the first time at a local brick show on the weekend it definitely looks better in real life than any pics i have decided to buy one	positive
a great review jim just finished building this set a couple of steps required abit of lego stressing to get together when there was an easier way just made it into rc  almost finished it in ldd which was easy to do as it has so much room for nearly any configuration of motors and not have them showing a great set edited by jonorocky 13 march 2015  1053 am	positive
wonderful review but i am still not sold on the set if we get more sets with the bright green i might be tempted to get it but until then it is too few parts in bright green too few different types not the number of pieces to be able to use that colour effectively in making mocs	neutral
excellent review thanks what is the cost in us not released in my area the shovel is obviously my favorite area it looks detailed and strong i love the treads because i need them to move the 4 x 4 barrels on my superscaled turbolaser turret very good pics too what color are the treads i never had them they are plastic or rubber edited by grand moff viceroy 03 august 2007  1234 am	positive
ickelpete on aug 3 2007 0926 am said the clutches are for the shovel and claw on the front and back the engine is driven from only one of the drive motors it works fine on our rugs but we have mainly wood floors not sure if is fairly strong i have only chased the cat at the moment  thank you wub i expected the engine was run from only one drive motor that would have involved some complicated mechanics to do otherwise	positive

ickel thanks for that awesome review it makes me want to buy this set i think itd go just swell with the mobile crane the fact that it has all the motors and such is awesome i can foresee using those for a lot of other functions for mocs and well im a fan of treads you can never have enough treads d hm would you be able to tell us perhaps after a test or two what kind of weight this beast can push around thank you	positive
hi many thanks for this review photos and videos i cant wait to put the hands on mine since it is already ordered and should arrive before the end of the month  could you post a scan or photos from those last pages in the building instructions where the parts included are listed thanks edited by conchas 04 august 2007  0719 pm	positive

the new small technic sets have incredible functionality for their size and this one is no exception with only 106 parts this crane can roll extend rotate lift and hold in any position and has working stabilisers the boom extends the same as the other sets with this boom simply pull it it works surprisingly well and due to circular ridges inside the boom the extension which is just a standard beam will hold in place the gear at the back controls the height of the boom as you can see the boom is only half extended boom fully extended half down the cable is kept in place via two gears and a blue pin same as the 7905 crane even under decent weights this works well the stabilisers however cannot handle much weight once the load is moved off axis the stablilsers are a very simple but effective design another shot of the stablilsers this also shows how far the boom will decend the boom height mechanism works well also i love the cab design overall this is a remarkable achievement for the low price i bought it for the boom piece as i want to improve the crane that came with 7998 7898    i highly recommend it	positive

thanks for all the feedback you guys robert8 on 12 april 2015  1125 pm said i cant help but think the minifigures are the weak part of the set snake and apu are great but the rest i dont know they kinda redundant now they could at least give us new torso printing like homer wearing his jacket or bart wearing his blue tshirt or marge wearing her coat or as i said in the discussion thread id have included jasper in cmf series 2 and a frozen version here overall the set looks kinda smaller than what i thought i agree but so many people were complaining about how the simpsons house should have included the most common versions mostly because the eyes or whatever so i think lego played it safe and just included the normal versions it makes sense since series 1 is gone forever and the common versions were in there and this set is bound to be in stock for a very long time like the death star i never really agreed when people were complaining about the alternate eye prints personally but i guess this is a good business choice based on previous feedback edited by just2good 13 april 2015  1206 am	negative

i have sooo mixed feeling about that i loved the simpsons house save for the terrible wall in the homer and marges room but this so far is inferior in almost every aspect the walls made of panels is a bummer i expect a d2c set to be better that this 60 stickers the same thing same price for less bricks and smaller build then the house strange coloured bricks on the outside wall some ugly mix of yellow  tan panels again with their fronts facing towards the inside of the shop so we and up with those squares all around the walls are yellow this was so nice lost opportunity to make it in some other less common colour then again the set overall looks is good the roof is a nice detail the shop looks actually like a real one not just an approximation of one the roof tiles are in dark orange  we got newrare colour here the car looks interesting to build just like the pink one from the house lots of nice references to the show its the simpsons definitely a must buy but for a discounted price ill try to find one with maybe damaged box or afterdisplay copy edited by mestari 14 april 2015  0115 pm	negative

thats actually not bad sizing imo sure it looks like you get a lot more with the house but the kwikemart has a lot more of those little references that make it simpsons i agree with some of the complaining a real jasper behind a transblue panel would have been cool you could always bulk up the roof with more foliage i think it has a great foundation as a set but could do with a few mods to make it better thanks for the pictures i greatly appreciate being able to see reviews like this before dropping 200 on a lego set	negative

i recently acquired 90 of this set so i thought i would do a review of it please note that half of the minifigs are wrong and there are some part substitutions this is the only set that comes with this plate there is a depression under the grey plates to the back the pool depression can be easily covered by three quarter circle plates which just happen to be included in this set good set design lego the stairs are old fabuland ones and have been used in a few other sets this is the only one that has them in parapink however what is the difference between parapink and pink dunno the big windows are in only two other sets both of them dacta ones the smaller ones were in one other paradisa set the interior while simple works very well i love the coffee machine a cute car came with the set as well the bird house is a nice idea as well once the current visitors leave i will probably be breaking this set i wish lego would go back to these sets as they always had some great parts in them	negative

nice review of a surprisingly interesting set y those windows are great and no doubt difficult to get classic coffee maker simple yet exactly right that baseplate was in a few other sets but never with that pattern would have made a great base for some of the classic 80s houses lego used to treat us to in tan was part of the adventurers egypt sets as recently as 2001 it was a base for ogel versatile plate that hopefully hasnt disappeared completely parapink is apparently light pink on brickshelf so i guess its just lighter than normal pink and stopped appearing in 1995 just so you know that monkey is drinking too much and likely to fall in the pool  	positive

tks sinner for that cool review  this set is not one of my favs never was really a big fan of those raised baseplates but had fantastic parts and mfs  it has great playability with really cool 80s miami feel wub that pink was actually pretty cool and went well with that lime green i think its lime but im not 100 positive once again this pisses me off so much that i was in my dark ages when this theme was out  i loved it especially all the beachwater themes wub i really wish tlc decided to bring that water paradisia back  who knows  after all they need to make some girlie sets  girls are a part of their market totally neglected  how many women we have on the boards  really a tiny few unfortunatly  so tlc please bring paradisia back in may 08 p  please  yoda	positive

phoinix on aug 15 2007 1258 am said ok its time for me to make a conffesion i have never wathced this show in my life and im not a bit curious on what the fuss is about your review is super as always yoda but i really cant say anything about the set cause i dont know what it is about the same counts for me i have never seen a single show so i only can argue about the bricks as are i dont like all the sb sets because of the inflationary use of stickers  more to that see below there are some bricks that are really cool like the bun disk but i wont buy this set just for single bricks i do like the color selection because of the comic strip relation though copmike on aug 15 2007 1042 am said on the stickers issue i so agree with you yoda  and i think its time to start a revolution  we need to adress this thing bigtime thru the ambassadors to lego and go 451 on thoso stickers yeah  revolution on if someone cares for the tar ill bring in the feathers d but  what is 451 about 8 y thank you yoda for your nice review y it will not change my attitude towards sb though p	negative

due to a larger bl order in the us i couldnt resist to add two hopper waggons to my train layout heres a review of this fantastic set the box well theres nothing really special about it the open box with three polybags note that there are only three different colors used in that set actually there are 4 but you cant see the dark grey ones great color composition by the way wub and  no stickers   d oooops  i opened the bags too fast help me im drowning sing not following the instructions i built the wheels first to get the larger pieces out of the way keep on rolling this is the load of the hopper waggon 11 round bricks altogether when i opened the set i was curious if it was a new colored set or an old one luckily enough it was an old one with old dark grey i dont know if tlc ever produced this set with bley from the following pic you can clearly see that the set is an old one look at these slope bricks see what i mean all bricks are looking exactly the same buy a set today means get at least three different textures on the slopes and maybe even more shades of tan x  i have said that in many other threads here and im saying it again back to the roots lego you were able to produce good quality show us you can still do it sad but now to the building its a 6 x 24 train base plate youre building on did i say i liked the colors d this is the mechanism to unload the waggon built in the waggon with open gates  and with closed ones almost done this is the first time i realized that minifigs actually can step on those ladders  a short lift and the wheels are fixed this darn mechanism wait im coming with my monkey wrench  who opened that door again do i have to do it all on my own  finally the work is done now have a brake one shot from the frontback you can see the car is really huge 8 i put it behind the red car of the 4512 that sure looked very strange wacko the set fits a lot better to the other cars of the my own train theme than to the older ones the score brick selection 1010 excellent color and brick selection these were the days playability 910 great unloading mechanism pricepiece count ratio 810 at peeron it says 20 i got it for 3995  30228 bricks not really cheap but worth every cent  overall rating 910 and a definity must buy for rolling stock lovers sad enough its not available on sh any more but there are still sets on bl and ebay thats for now folks thank you for reading i have some job to do	positive

the set and the other designer sets that came out with it especially 4888 are incredibly well designed sets i wish lego would go back to doing sets like these as i loved the multitude of instructions and ideas the last batch of creator sets had zero ideas even though i know several were made  anyway less whining more review the lion is the main model his mouth doesnt fully close but it does open more the head works well from most angles i love the dark orange bricks great for rust he is quite solid but the joints take the weight well the neck goes side to side and rotates but doesnt go up and down the body is built in two parts and pinned in the middle with what is left you can make what i think is a hyena a silly plant moc and what i believe is a vulture there are also instructions for a few other models including a bat boar and a snake which i quite like he can be built at the same time as this cute little lizard overall this is a great set with an excellent blend of colours and pieces i wanted it for steampunk potentials sweet i hope you liked the review till next time	positive

great review as always y lego is timeless so there is no such thing as an old set i never build brick monsterscreatures but this set had such a nice assortment of parts that i had to pick a couple up as they werent clearancing out on shop  home i absolutely love dark orange and tan so it was an automatic win i love the use of familiar characters in the review i can almost hear hinckley screaming my megabloks p you sort of look like youre planning some vulture stew though might have to start a new challenge to determine a winner there sinner and his big pot o doom vs giant vulture only thing is does everything horrify the mrs she seems perpetually shocked andor dismayed at the goings on here now that i think about it i can see why im occasionally shocked andor dismayed 8 brick built beasties on y	positive

lego 75915 pteranodon capture im glad to review this nice set 75915 pteranodon capture name pteranodon capture set number 75915 pieces 174 price 1999 minifigs 2 theme jurassic world year of release 2015 links box the front of the box has the jurassic world logo along with the set number piece count etc its a decent box size for a 20 set here it is compared to a minifigure heres the back of the box it shows all of the features from the set an ad for the video game the back also shows a small picture with a silhouette of the dinosaurs from the line along with their set numbers instruction booklet the booklet shows the same thing as the front of the box nothing more nothing less near the back of the booklet there is a picture with all of the characters from the sets the other page shows all the dinosaurs with a mini box that shows the size comparisons the minifigures the minifigures in this set are simon masrani and an acu both of them have excellent printing on the front and the back the gun is the same one from tlm that the ssp used simon masrani is the only one with a double sided face his second face shows a scaredworried expbbression he has a zipped up jacket or jumpsuit with a shirt underneath the acu trooper only has one face which is a scaredworried expbbression i would have a scared expbbression too if i was about to get eaten by a dinosaur he has great detail on his torso and legs lets take a look at the vest the vest is the same mold from the ssp in tlm i think it has the letters acu on the front too the back is nothing interesting pteranodon the pteranodon has great printing too the colors match the ones that the pteranodons from the movie have the wings mouth and head are a rubbery type of plastic and are easily bendable it uses the same mold from the pteranodon in the 2012 dino line heres a comparison between the two spare parts the spare parts arent many just a few extras the helicopter at first the helicopter was meh when i first saw it on the box now that ive built it ive got to say that i really like it its my favorite helicopter of all of the ones ive built its sturdy and sleek its not too bulky either the first play feature in this set is the net launcher it works pretty well not one of my favorite features but it does what its meant to do the other play feature is on the other side its a stud shooter which can be used by a minifigure you can put it on their hand or you can leave it there and let someone operate it the shooter can fold up inside the helicopter as well there are stickers on both sides of the helicopter and they also have the jurassic world logo with dino marks final verdict value 910  for 20 this set isnt that bad the parts count is a little low for a 20 set but the price is probably because of licensing other than that its a great deal i wouldve hoped for maybe some bait for the pteranodon but that can easily be fixed design 910  i really love the way this helicopter looks its sleekness and design is great the only flaw this has is the huge net launcher its too big in my opinion minifigs 1010b  the minifigures are extremely detailed and it even includes an exclusive minifigure playability 910  there are many things you can do with this set the swoosh factor is great and so are the play features parts 1010b  theyre useful parts and there isnt many huge specialized pieces in here either overall 910  this set is great for fans of jurassic world its also a nice parts pack theres one exclusive minifigure in here too which makes it even better having a little fun with the set hope you liked my first review here on eurobricks please leave any suggestions on what to improve thanks edited by thelazychicken 02 may 2015  1019 pm	positive
i love the dinos in these sets but aside from that the builds imo kind of suck just like the last dino sets this just has a franchise connected to it and honestly i hope it does well enough to spark more dinojurassic parkworld interest because i want to see more dino minifigures maybe a brontosaurus or something i will most likely be buying many of the dinosaur minifigures here however i doubt ill buy the actual sets or the genetically altered dinosaur which can only work for jurassic world this set is imo average love the dinosaur	negative

lego 31036 creator toy and grocery shop thanks to eurobricks for making this review possible for years lego has offered a house of some sort in the creator line each year  with the standard creator 3in1 instructions thats given us a very wide variety of housing in 2014 they added a business option with their 31026 bike shop and cafe set this continues into this years toy and grocery shop set these shops are smaller than the very detailed modular buildings but that should help them fit in better with the other city sets and this also lets them get into more kids cities with their lower pricetag name toy and grocery shop set number 31036 pieces 466 price 3999 minifigs 2 theme creator year of release 2015 links bricklink peeron brickset the box the front of the box shows the a version model out of the three plus insets of the b and c versions i like the sortaeuropean looking backdrop it goes well with the styling of the buildings interestingly the main model is shown opened up for play while the two insets show those versions folded the box top on the top of the box lego helpfully shows that with 3 of these sets you can make a whole street the box back on the back you get to again see all three versions together but this time folded its a little creepy though with those clones running around  the manuals yep three actual printed manuals theres nothing indicating them as being a b and c models but its pretty obvious looking at the designs which is the main model and which are the alternates the contents bags of parts and two plates nothing terribly exciting to see here the minifigs nothing new here but two nice figs nonetheless well bricklink does say that both figs are unique to this set but theres not any new parts to them the closest thing to rare is the female head  its only in this set 2013s dragon mountain castle set a uk store grand opening set and one of the 2014 holiday freebie sets the faces arent that unique but i guess this exact combo of two faces on the head is i love the kid torso with the spaceman on it the minifig backs no back printing on anything here except for an alternate female face sorry i do like that her two faces are so different though thats much better than when a head has a scared and a more scared face the c build enough with the basics lets build im going to review them in the same order i built them backwards since you can tell immediately looking at the 3 designs that theyre going to use different numbers of pieces and so forth i figured id build the smallest first lest it seem like a letdown all three have some basic similarities  the two plates are hinged to give a building that opens for play they also do have interiors which you can see starting to form here the c build front its a pretty quick build so its done already heres the front of the building with it opened up like this it appears to be two separate stores a newsstand and some sort of shop you can enter all the printed tiles help give the newsstand a detailed appearance but im not sure why theyve got a 100 bill lying on the ledge the c build rear from the back side the interiors are pretty plain the shop half has a plant in a jar and a weird chair and the newsstand just has a register the c build sides heres the two sides of the folded building on the hinge side theres a bunch of windows in a disjointed wall with random colors on the other why did they put in a huge window when the set does include a transclear door that could have gone there and you get a small patch of plants like so many sets seem to have these days the c build extras thats a lot of leftovers there and not just little stuff  multiple doors stairs etc and unused sand green is always a little sad the b build 1 a pretty similar start with the hinge and little garden and some tiles along the ground the b build 2 now we see a big windowed wall some details like lights and how it has the usual alternate model weird part usage  like a 1x4 brick with side studs being used over the doorway even though those side studs will not get used the b build front the finished building gives us a nice little post office with a lettercarrying bird on the roof hope thats not their normal method of delivery something about the colors just doesnt work for me though the combo of white  light grey  dark grey  black  sand green plus tan is just too much the tan window and door frames i dont like the b build inside on the inside things are weird the counter on the left is ok but the light above the door with a yellow clip ugly is too big and everything else over there by the door doesnt make much sense either the b build sides i like the front side here except the colors are still too much the bench greenery mailbox on the corner and streetlight are all nice the boy is a little creepy though  binoculars in hand plus a telescope on the roof of the post office why the hinge side shows more of the weird colors you get in the wall but thats going to be hidden when the set is open plus we even see that on big modulars at times so its not so terrible the b build leftovers again a lot of leftover parts its obvious this was another alternate but itd be nice to see more of them used to make a bigger building but lets move on to the model that does use them all the a build 1 the first half starts like this maybe its just my bias but it already feels like a more detailed build bottles on the wall the yellow and red awning over the window etc the a build 2 the other half starts off with detailed work too i think thats a red vending machine the stairs are also very solidly built i also appreciate the effort to get that diagonal base where a door will be  its such a nice touch to have sections of a building that arent right angles the a build 3 not too much has been added but i wanted to showcase the tiny toys before they get hidden by a wall that robot and train are just fantastic little micro builds the a build 4 things are coming together quickly the walls windows and doors get the first floor nearly done im still not big on the sand green and tan combo but i do really like the red and yellow awnings the a build 5 it appears the shop owner lives upstairs since weve got a bedroom forming here the bed is a little plain but the table and lamp on the other half are great and my big fingers did not like putting all those railings on the balcony with the telescope posts and tile tops knocked quite a few off before i got them all done the a build front and its done all the details make this set really feel like a minimodular the roofline has great greebling and the shop contents and on and on its not perfect though the tiny car above the toy store door isnt nearly as good as the toys inside and the kids yellow scooter the wheels arent even on the ground much less able to roll the scooter looks decent though so that counts for something well at least as long as you are at this angle since the boys only got 1 foot on the 1 stud wide scooter the a build inside most of the interior has been seen already the roof though does a nice job of being interesting for a roof a skylight the edge rails etc and you can see theres not much wrong color in the walls the a model sides an interesting building when folded up very tall and skinny you can tell its not really meant to be displayed this way  its meant to be open the good  lots i like the awning the diagonal door the flowerbox under the upper window the folding gate on the balcony that lets it be used in open or closed mode and the green  white  blue colors the bad  well the stairs end short of the upper door i still dont really like the tan doorframes i think black would have been better and why dont the upper floors match up in size the a model leftovers ah thats more like it just a few small pieces left as spares the errors you might have to click through to the fullsize versions but i did catch a few weird errors in the manuals first in the photo of the newsstand the map in the front corner is on there sideways the map does have a clear north arrow printed on it on the second image the boys feet are hanging off the edge just unusual to see an alignment error in the manual like that the comparison here are this set and the modular detective office side by side theres a huge difference  as youd expect but is the difference more than youd expect this set is 466 parts 40 the do is 2262 pieces and 160 5 times the parts 4 times the price looking at them side by side id expect a bigger difference in both the conclusion so whats my conclusion on this model i love the main model but the alternates are meh its a nice set for someone looking for a town building other than police and fire stations but who isnt ready to move to the modular line compared to the modulars though it seems overpriced part of that is because the huge modulars are actually a great deal compared to other lego sets im also a little surprised that its so small when you compare it to the city sets like a police station those are generally designed with much more open space letting them be more of a playset this one is small and cramped so itd be tougher to play in its not really a city set though the ratings value 710  its under the 10 cents a part mark but thats largely due to having a ton of tiny parts all those flowers and decorative 1x1 round studs add up quickly design 710  good and bad on the colors and theres a big difference between the quality of the main vs alternate models having so many leftover pieces is one thing when the creator set makes 3 very different models ie a boat plane and truck when its 3 buildings it seems wasteful to have so many parts leftover minifigs 610  im not sure they both fit the set i suppose the boy is going to the toy store and the woman is going to the grocery but theres no storekeeper in either the woman doesnt look like a storekeeper to me so thats why i assume shes another shopper i love the boy but the woman is just soso  except that i do appreciate the head having two very different expressions but again that doesnt fit the set i cant see her scared face being used playability 610  the shops are detailed with registers and so forth but its all so tiny itd be hard to play with the figs in it parts 910  tons of windows and doors plus nice sand green bricks but some things the large blue curves used on the roof for example are weirdly specialized and would be hard to use in another building design overall 710  id recommend doing what i did  build the alternates first then

a terrific very comprehensive review  but im not at all impressed with this set it feels like a mishmash of bricks with no clear design aesthetic and as such blatantly underdeveloped ie designed to hit a pricebrick count point rather than provide a solid set in the creator town tradition compared to other creator sets at this price point 31025  mountain hut for example it feels utterly uninspired and ugly edited by johnny6666 04 may 2015  1002 am	negative

as a fan of creator houses i really want to like this set however i think that creator houses have long filled a niche thats neglected elsewhere residential houses we havent had a larger residential house since 2013 im not sure if these sets have anything to do with that but it seems like they may be the replacement for larger houses and id much rather have a larger house set than a set like this i also agree with many others here something about it just feels incomplete i think that the various city business buildings weve gotten in recent years including those in this years city squarewhich is much more expensive than this but also contains much more make for better buildings at this scale	positive
thanks andy0306uk your very clever strategic decision to serve us with blurry pictures allowed me to glance at this review without ruinating that whole wonderful advent surprise too much p y but although i loved the last years one i think they could do another theme or perhaps even two calendars because right now castles pretty hot imo	positive
thank you andy for your speed review y so theres nothing left to open while advent  i like all the tiny sets it neednt be another police and fireman   but well what would an advent calendar be without them d one thing about the train traffic lights tlc used to give us similar lights but you could show either of the lights with the other one being covered that one was waaay better  just a little piece more would have done the thing and i wont mention the radarcrapdish x let me quote franz beckenbauer is denn scho weihnacht legendary quote from an promotional job he did years ago  is it xmas already	neutral

im a big fan of anime and have watched some mechas like full metal panic neon evangelion genesis it is a mecha and chobits well she is a robot so i was curious to see what this new exo force line was all about the colorful sets and mangalike characters didnt persuade me right away but the urgent need for a couple of white 3x3 wing plates made me purchase this little thing it cost me 70 dkr as you can see on the box this is 930 euro or about the same an american has to pay for the new republic cruiser pretty expensive for so few pieces 90  a spare technic pin the box an actionpacked box with one of the sides being oddly empty except from the legologo whats inside there is a small building instruction two polybags no bag building here and a sticker sheet with alarmingly many stickers the build it takes so little time to build this set that i didnt get to take any pictures of the process every step was accompanied by an element description although i doubt most of you will need that with so few pieces to keep track on most of the dark green bricks have a sticker  even the slopes where the rough surface makes stickers fall off easily there should also have been a sticker on the windshield but i wanted to keep that piece clean for better usage later im one of those who keeps stickers on the bricks the model you want to see this model from the front as the back is pretty much neglected there isnt much for the pilot to grab a hold on either he is pretty much a sitting duck up there with the screen giving him only partial cover there is a huge wrench next to him which kind of symbolizes the crudeness of the mech the set isnt called cyclone defender for nothing the right arm might hold an ordinary light assault riffle but the other has a spinning disc with samurai swords which you can turn with the yellow knob on the backside those of you who have seen robot wars might remember the incredible power of this melee weapon from a robot named hypnodisc it would have been nice had there been a pullback motor to power the disc im sure lego has a lot of these in stock but the simple mechanism still works reasonably well the riffle comes off and a pin makes it easy to hold with the hand but the disc is fixed to the arm it is also a problem that the swords get misaligned quickly during play the minifig i really like this minifig because of the neat idea with an expression on each side that lego has made a standard for exo force posability most mechmocers show off their creations using gundamlike poses with two joints per leg one being the ankles and one for an arm i thought of some less serious poses crawling silent like a ninja belly gliding kick off upside down final rating i have to disappoint you here this is my first set in this line and i have absolutely no idea of how good it is the last robot i bought was the awesome 6889 spyrius recon robot for the same price but it is in a completely different genre the set had what i expected two white wings and is as such a nononsense set i guess it would be of more use if you have some more exo force which i dont 610 ups has great minifig weapons and is easy to build downs crude design and a bit too expensive for what you get brickshelf gallery	neutral

i couldnt find a review of this wonderful set in here so here it goes i got the set for msrp 180kr  24 euro which is a fair price here in denmark as all other creator sets there are instructions for several models 3 in this case the box the box is a little larger than city sets in the same price range the primary model is shown on the front while you see the secondary ones on the back what you get 312 pieces in 5 polybags and two building instructions one for the primary model and the other for the rest the built it was impossible for me to speed build this model because of the nifty functional details from the retractable landing gear to the wings that can turn by means of the handle in the back of the model it took me a full hour to build it because i had to test how it all works together the finished model the landing gear isnt fully enclosed when retracted and the models are subminifig scale but i still love the design of the models the doors for the rear wheels open as you pull the wheels down and the final piece of functionality comes from the wings that can either tilt the horizontal stabilizers or have elevators wing in wings out wings in wings out ratings as a whole i actually like this set even more than the big rig the models are just as diverse but the added functionality makes the plane more fun to play with than the rig price 710  a good price but not a bargain as the big rig design 910  there could have been a sligtly higher level of details in the main model but all models are really good looking and i especially like the design of the hovercraft functionality 1010  i guess you could ask for working rudders opening cockpit and so on but the plane is really filled with movable parts and the turning of the wings works really well secondary models 710  a hovercraft how awesome is that if only the last model was just as inventive instead of a standard helicopter modifiability 810  the bricks are in ordinary colours and there is a good variety of them giving you plenty of possibilities for mocing you can easily make the main model into something that looks more like an f14 910 probably as good as it gets for a creator set in this price range it is entertaining to both build and play with looks good and the secondary models are worth building as well brickshelf gallery	positive

it is no secret that marvel is one of the most successful companies right now from the avengers to the xmen and down to even the most obscure characters like antman every one of their movies has been a big hit until now the latest marvel movie fant4stic was released last month and while i have not seen it yet im sure its just as great as their other movies i mean it has the word fantastic in the title after all and being the smart business that they are the lego company decided to get in on the hype early and capitalize on this movies undoubtful success two years in advance by making a set featuring fant4stics main villain dr doom now thats what i call forward thinking but did they do a good job with it or were they being overhasty lets find out set number 76005 name spiderman daily bugle showdown theme marvel super heroes subtheme ultimate spiderman year of release 2013 pieces 476 minifigs 5 price 4999 usd sh description quote swing into the daily bugle and stop dr doom™ dr doom™ and his henchman beetle™ are attacking the daily bugle in their speedy jet to steal spidermans™ secret identity its up to spiderman™ and nova™ to swing in and stop them trigger the daily bugles explosion functions to cause destruction as the jet fires missiles stop dr doom™ from hitching the jets anchor hook to the safe with spidermans secret inside knock beetle™ off the building with the swinging web attack and drop dr doom™ inside with the rooftop trapdoor then fly nova™ in through the broken window with the dumpster catapult function and send those villains back to where they came from includes spiderman™ nova™ dr doom™ beetle™ and j jonah jameson™ with accessories and weapons the first thing that comes to mind after reading this description is wow thats a lot of tms anyway here are some resource links for this set brickset bricklink rebrickable the box since this set is based on the ultimate spiderman cartoon the box has the usual usm design with the red marvel super heroes background an illustration of spidey in the upper right corner and the usm logo in the lower right as usual there is a minifig line up in the lower left and since this was before the terrible redesign you can see the full body of the minifigs i really miss this type of line up there is quite a lot going on here doctor doom attacking the daily bugle in his jet while simultaneously reaching for j jonah jameson below with his jets claw spiderman reluctantly swings in to save him while nova fights off the beetle its a pretty cool scene even though its not very accurate to the show in beetle mania the episode that this set is based on the beetle was indeed out to kill jjj but it was in order to stop him from exposing his identity not spidermans although spidey was next on jjjs list and while he is a recurring villain on the show doctor doom had nothing to do with this plot and didnt even appear in the episode aside from a brief cameo its awesome that they included him anyway though so im not gonna complain note that the tower is so tall that it wraps around the top of the box there you can also see a scale reference with the spiderman minifig on the back of the box you can see the interior of the bugle and all of its play features which there are quite a few of since this is a playset its all illustrated pretty well although legos choice of sound effects is still a mystery to me i dont get why they dont go for spidermans signature fwip instead of fazzing and i didnt know that a breaking window made the sound btoom but i digress contents inside the box you will find three instruction booklets one smaller than the others a comic book a fairly large sticker sheet five numbered bags and two loose pieces a white string piece and a gray 16x8 plate there arent really any notable pieces and nobody cares about the comic bock no offense to the artist so lets get right to the instructions they are pretty straight forward and easy to follow some of the pages have a ghostly image of spidey nova and dr doom in the top right corner which is fitting since these are all minifigs that appear in this set which is strangely not something that can be said for many other super heroes instructions with this type of artwork minifigures as with most super heroes sets most people will get this set mainly for the minifigs so without further ado lets talk about them spiderman is the same old bootless one you get in almost every usm set not much to say about him some might complain that we dont get spideys alter ego peter parker in this set but in the usm cartoon mj is actually the one who works at the daily bugle not peter curse the creators of this cartoon for ruining our chances of getting a new peter parker minifig by trying to mix things up next we get j jonah jameson he appeared in a spiderman 2 set before but this is a complete redesign he now has a blue suit with a red tie a unique face print and that combedback hair in dark gray this new hairpiece doesnt suit him at all and the old flat top hair was perfect for him in my opinion so i dont know why they changed it the good thing about this change however is the fact that this piece is exclusive to this set in that color nova on the other hand is spoton he comes with a new helmet mold and some nice torso printing however he too is missing his boots tlc should have started making dualcolored legs a long time ago here are some reference images to compare them to okay so jjjs hair may not be completely black in the show but i still think they should have given his minifig a black hairpiece his suit is also not quite the right color he rarely appears in person in the show including the episode this set is based on and is usually seen on screens around new york so this is the best picture of him i could find i guess i should be happy they included a minifig of him at all in the episode it was actually mary jane who was at the bugle during beetles attack so it would have made more sense to include her but we got her in the spidercopter set one year later so thats ok all three of them have back printing in jjjs case im using that term loosely since it is only comprised of two lines but its nice that they went through the trouble of adding them both jjj and nova come with angry alternate faces it almost looks like theyre trying to outangry each other who do you think looks angrier let me know in the comments section below now lets talk about the bad guys even though he would be better off in a fantastic four set its great to finally get victor van doom one of the greatest marvel villains ever and in comics in general he comes with a dark green hood which was new and exclusive in that color at the time and he is the only minifig in this set that has leg printing beetle is a regular minifig with wings the metallic printing on his face and torso is pretty nice but i wish it would have continued onto his legs as well the beetle looks quite accurate to his onscreen counterpart the only thing that could have improved him is a new helmet mold with pointy eyebrowsantennae doctor doom however looks nothing like he does in the movie i just dont understand how lego could have messed him up so badly maybe they were working off of early concept art or something here is a back view of doom and beetle beetle would be a pretty boring minifig if it wasnt for his wings which are awesome with their holographic texture they are so mesmerizing i could look at those things all day this piece also appeared in trans light green in the galaxy squad sets which came out at the same time here they are without their gear as you can see they both have back printing as well and no doctor doom does not come with an alternate facial expression which is fine since you cant see much of his expressions due to his mask anyway heres a look at dr doom and nova without their headgear some say that dooms face looks too cartoony but i think it looks fine nova is wearing stylish goggles as a way of explaining his white eyes its a far better explanation than the batsweatband they did the same thing with the masked wolverine later here are all the figs with their accessories jjj comes with a camera so that he can take more pictures of spiderman beetle comes with one of those overused adu guns which is a very poor representation of his wristmounted blasters i hate to say it but even those bulky new stud shooters would have been a better representation of his weapons spidey comes with his usual string of webbing and nova comes with some iron man style translucent studs the weird thing is that they are red while his powers have a blue glow in the show doctor doom sadly doesnt get any accessories but who needs weapons when you have a jet with a claw and flickfire missiles the build the first bag contains spiderman a brick separator and the parts to build the ground floor of the dbc building after a quick and straightforward build you get this the dumpster and street lamp are separate from the building and since the lamp post is not built onto any baseplate and is quite topheavy it gets knocked over pretty easily maybe its meant to be that way but i would have preferred it if you could stick it onto the baseplate of the building on which there is unfortunately not enough space to do so as you would expect the second bag has the parts for the first floor of the building this is also the bag that contains beetle after another fairly simple build youll find yourself with a two story building with a spiderweb one side and a fire escape on the other however you have to apply three stickers during this section of the build which is never fun can you guess whats in bag number 3 yup the second floor of the building you dont need superpowers to predict that one also this bag contains nova and jameson the build of this section is a bit repetitive since the second floor is mostly the same as the first and it takes slightly longer to build since you have to build the rooftop as well also in addition to the two window stickers you have to apply ten 2x2 tile stickers trying to do this without having any of them being crooked is a real pain in the megablocks the next bag contains doctor doom and the cockpit of his jet dooms cape is in the usual square white box and the string for the claw is folded up in a piece of tape heres what you get at the end of this section looks more like an escape pod than a jet at this point the final bag is the smallest as it only includes the few parts needed to finish the doom jet once you build the wings and tail you stick them onto the cockpit via technic pins and youre done spare parts these are the parts that are left over after the build there is the brick separator of course an extra antenna and the usual little bits and bops whats really awesome though is that they give you an extra pair of beetles wings considering what a neat piece this is and that this is the only set in which it comes in transblack make this a very welcome spare that you can use in your customs the finished set here is the complete set the dbc building looks quite tall especially when you count the antenna comparing it to a screenshot from the episode the general look of the building is there although there are some inaccuracies aside from the fact that it is obviously way downscaled the screens that show jjj ranting about spiderman should have been hexagonal not square and should have wrapped around the building however considering how many stickers you would have had to apply if they would have made it accurate im actually glad they kept the screen mercifully small much like doctor doom himself the doom jet didnt actually appear in the beetle mania episode however it did appear in a later episode titled not a toy in which spiderman plays around with captain americas shield accidentally drops it in doctor dooms latvarian embassy and has to try to retrieve it and yes that episode was as godawful as it sounds heres a screenshot of the jet from that episode like with the dbc they managed to capture the general shape of the vehicle although it doesnt look quite as good as in the show the color scheme is too dark and it looks kind of blockier lets take a closer look at the jet there is no real way to reel the claw in unfortunately however there is a stud on the back of the jet that you can stick it onto needless to say this is not the ideal way of storing it i would have much preferred it if they would have attached it onto winch instead the engines on the wings can be turned even though they dont turn in the show and there is a flickfire missile on each side even if its not much to look at at least its a very swooshable vehicle on top of each wing there is a tile with the emblem of latvaria there was no such emplems on the jet in the cartoon but they are useful pieces that make it clear whose jet it is so im glad they included them there is nothing inside the cockpit except for a seat and unless you want to ruin dr dooms nice dark green cape i wouldnt put him inside of it they could have at least printed a control panel onto that empty 2x2 tile play features since this is a playset lets look at all the play features it has to offer like all playsets the building is open in the back so you can play inside on the ground floor there is a potted plant and nothing else seriously is this all they could come up with for this floor they could have included a security desk a lounge a second plant or anything else as it is its just a boring empty lobby the first floor is a bit more interesting there is a safe a swiveling chair and a pin board with various pictures of spiderman there is one tile that reads the true identity of spiderman which is supposedly what the villains are after i wonder how jameson got this information in the first place speaking of jameson the second floor is devoted to his office where he can sit and yell at his nonpresent employees demanding more pictures of spiderman it also has a swiveling chair as well as a desk with a lamp and a computer there is a technic beam connecting his desk with the ceiling of the first floor which you can remove in order to take off the upper half of the building but its difficult to do so i dont recommend it as you may have noticed in the picture above there are a few red pegs sticking out of the building these are for triggering the play features most of them are on the roof there is one on what looks like an air conditioning unit if you place spiderman holding is webstring on the jumper plate in front of it and push the peg spidey goes bungeejumping off the building wee there is also one that sticks out of the side of the building which when pulled triggers a trap door the third red peg on the roof can be used to pop off the dbc sign why is it called the dbc you ask it stands for daily bugle communications since in this version of spiderman the daily bugle is not only a newspaper but a news tv station as well one that promotes its own highly biased views so basically the fox news of the marvel universe i guess if youre an old school spiderman fan you could just leave off the c and have it just stand for daily bugle the sign above the main entrance wont be so easily modified however there is also a peg between the first and second floor which when pushed pops out one of the windows on the first floor the safe is only attached to a couple of jumper plates and has some jumper plates on top of it as well so you can easily attach the doom jets claw to it and rip it out of the building as seen on the back of the box there are also some snot bricks on the corners of the building that you can attach spiderwebs or spidey himself onto for some wallcrawling and webslinging action this is not so much a play feature as it is just a feature but as i mentioned earlier there is a fire escape on the left side of the building this was a neat idea as it helps it feel like a building in new york city but it is executed very poorly there is no hole big enough for the minifigs to climb down through so they would have to climb down the ladders from the outside which makes no sense no wonder spiderman always needs to rescue people from burning buildings there is one more play feature in the form of the dumpster you can open the lid put a minifig inside and make them jump by hitting a tab in the back remember this is before the introduction of super jumpers but nevertheless its a pretty strange place to launch minifigs out of i guess even super heroes like to do some dumpster diving you dont think this was funny no well me neither but thats the type of humor that this show loves to use sigh anyway lets get on to the ratings ratings design 25  the set looks ok despite many inaccuracies the dbc building and the jet somewhat resemble their onscreen counterparts and dont look too bad but they definitely could be better build 15  a mostly unchallenging and repetitive build with an attrocious amount of stickers minifigs 45  definitely the strongest point of the set some of the figs could be better but four out of five of them are exclusive to this set doctor doom is easily the best and probably the most desirable one  unless the fant4stic movie portraits him so badly that nobody will be interested in him but thats impossible playability 45  as you would expect from a playset the playability is quite high although i still feel like there could have been more parts 35  not many rare parts if youre looking for parts for building your own skyscraper with tan walls and lots of doors and windows though this set is for you price 35  at 476 parts for 50 this set is a bit pricey but it is somewhat justified by all the large window and wall pieces overall 35  this set is mediocre at best playsets are always a good choice for spiderman sets since they give spidey something to swing from but unfortunately they are rarely pulled off well the jet is blocky the building is barebones and the price feels too high the only reason to get this set are the four exclusive minifigs this set was discontinued early this year but if you still see it on clearance somewhere go ahead and get one for the minifigs and parts or buy multiples and use the parts to build a better dbc building i hope you enjoyed this review it is part of the reviewers academys 7th anniversary were not doing a big celebration this year due to other commitments but look out for more reviews with the 7th anniversary banner soon now if youll excuse me i am off to see fant4stic i hope its as fantastic as it promises to be 2 hours later i was wrong i was horribly horribly wrong	positive
hahah entertaining and informative a great read thanks for the review on a side note i thought fantfourstic wasok on the poorer side of ok the exposition felt like it was from a 3 hour film because it was so long and towards the middle it started to drag the ending was terrible edited by mutant orc 12 september 2015  0953 pm	positive
this is my favourite set should be making more spidey sets like this imo cough oscorp tower cough	positive
yeah im really hoping the concept artdoom minifig joke is just that i picked this set up on whim mostly because a needed a building to add to a moc as a parts pack its not a bad set at all	positive
aegis2000 on 13 september 2015  0232 am said this set is from 2013 doctor doom is completely based off the comic version tv show version not the movie in any way anyways nice review i personally own this set and its a nice set but could have been better hes just joking about doom	neutral
i actually am surprised at the poor points this set has gotten as this is one of my favorite sets that marvel has put out i actually would like to hear what your thoughts are on the usm  lego dr doom comparison oky thanks for the review httpmarvelanimateordoomusmpng edited by zorglorfian 14 september 2015  0644 am	neutral
thanks everyone darthbrickus on 13 september 2015  0253 pm said thanks for the review ive had that set for quite a while and its among my favorite marvel superheroes sets actually compared to the other stuff we usually get to accompany the minifigs all those laboratorys the most recent construction site and the hydra fortress  yeah youre being a little harsh here perhaps youre right maybe i was a bit too harsh on this set dont get me wrong its not a bad set especially compared to some other sets we have gotten in this price range but somehow i was still expecting more darthbrickus on 13 september 2015  0253 pm said maybe youre still suffering from ptsd after watching fantfourstic i still have not seen it actually and i dont ever plan to so dont worry no okys were harmed in the making of this review im a brickmaster on 13 september 2015  0355 am said yeah im really hoping the concept artdoom minifig joke is just that yes the whole doctor doomfant4stic thing was obviously a joke everybody knows what doctor doom is supposed to look like except for the makers of fant4stic apparently zorglorfian on 14 september 2015  0644 am said i actually would like to hear what your thoughts are on the usm  lego dr doom comparison oky thanks for the review httpmarvelanimateordoomusmpng theres not much to say really doom in usm looks just like he does in the comics and lego recreated that look perfectly again hes definitely the best part of this set	neutral
im glad you were joking about doom im not that big of a fanboy but i had the need to correct you for some reason with that said i bought this set for the minifigures a few years ago looking back i dont really care about the figures today like i did in 2013 the building is decent for the size of the set though thanks for the review	neutral

overall i wish marvel in particular would have more playsets in its theme batman has several great ones in the dc theme but then again if this is the best playset to date for marvel maybe its better just to leave well enough alone i would definitely like to see them attempt something in the 100 us price range because i think it could be good marvel needs an equivalent to the arkham asylum set regarding this set i saved myself some money and bought the 4 minifigs i needed all but spidey on bricklink for less than half the set price edited by dmarvin 17 september 2015  0625 pm	neutral
personally i thought your review was spot on and i very much enjoyed your tone im not usually much of a minifig person but i will admit i bought this set mostly for dr doom and considered nova a bonus growing up i was a big fan of the fantastic four and an even bigger fan of dr doom i hope that someday the film rights will revert to marvel and well finally get a ff film that respects the original source material and features a dr doom worthy of the name as for the set itself i dont have much use for playsets not that theres anything wrong with them i think the marvel lego line could use more of them in fact and i didnt even realize it was linked to a specific show as ive fallen a bit out of touch with the franchise of late i bought it i built it it sat a shelf for a while i scrapped it for parts i think most of it wound up as a greenhouse for my winter village setup its not a bad set but i think you summed things up nicely when you called it mediocre thanks for the entertaining review	neutral
thanks for the reviewim not a big fan of spider man sets but this set really impressed me this must because of the design of this set and the minifigures that included in this set	positive
i think im the only person in the world who likes fant4stic was it the best superhero movie not even close but i didnt think it deserved the hate it got it was just incredibly and clumsily mishandled anyways great review i might pick this one up if only for the beetle fig	negative

hello everyone by now many excited lego star wars fans have started receiving their ucs falcon some of us here enjoy writing reviews and sharing our thoughts i mentioned to yoda that i was planning on doing a review of this set but it would likely take me a few weeks of 12 hours per night to finish building the set yoda suggested that i do the review as i go so everyone could see the progress of the set what a great idea so here is the first entry feel free to comment along the way i will try to post photos and updates every night on the build then wrap up the review when i complete the set if you have any specific questions or photo requests please be sure to ask ucs millennium falcon reviewed by dunamis set 10179 5195 pieces 49995 from lego shop at home the box obviously this is a box like no other first of all it comes in its own shipping carton inside of that there is a standard lego carton finally inside the lego carton we have the actual millennium falcon box and a nice little letter thanking you for buying the biggest lego set ever shipping box naboo set provided for scale lego carton and letter lego carton the millennium falcon box is really quite nice there are lots of photos and it does a good job of selling the set there are 8 individual pieces of tape that keep the lid on the box the limited first edition comes with a seal on the lower left corner millennium falcon box naboo set provided for scale lifting the lid straight up reveals one compartment of several bags on the right on the left we find a thin square box like a pizza box that contains the official certificate of authenticity two sticker sheets and one enormous manual under the pizza box we find two more compartments each filled with several typical lego bags the box weighs 24 pounds stickers pizza box pieces in compartments not quite sure what the little 30th anniversary sticker is for yet the certificate of authenticity is on heavy paper and is suitable for framing more to come tomorrow its late here	positive
nice review ill be watching and waiting for the rest	positive
will follow this impatiently  really like the start of the review y you always seems to pull it of nicely in comparission with the exasperating yoda xd p build on play on on on	positive
many tks dunamis for doing that its really great and i cant wait monitoring your progress on the beast 8 like it was mentionned in another thread the box looks less gigantic than i thought  remember the isd box  that was a huge box  is the instruction book in the pizza box  how big is it  im sure its really big and i hope for our sake that the colours are clearly marked xd if you know what i mean d  tks againand im so looking forward to your next post  ras 74 on sep 27 2007 0851 am said you always seems to pull it of nicely in comparission with the exasperating yoda xd p what what what  have you stopped your medication once again xd yoda	positive
excellent beginning our numbers are very close but i havent the luxury of space to build it so ill be enjoying it by proxy through you enjoy y	positive

what a wonderful idea and how nice from you sweet and go killer go	positive
tks for that comparison pic dunamis  ok the box is big  i pictured it a tad smaller though  i know what i dont like its the fact that it has the regular lego star wars logo on top with vader ucs sets should have a different iconography like they did in the past sure its a trivial detail but it adds to the fact of owning something special  after all its the most expensive set ever as of now  happy building  and well wait patiently for some cool pics later on p yoda	negative
the manual the gigantic manual measures 17 x 12 and is almost an inch thick it is spiral bound with a cardboard like front and back and it is 314 pages interesting decision not to break it up into multiple manuals it is almost unwieldy at this size and thickness unfortunately the manual is not available electronically from the lego website hopefully it will be soon missing were the little instructions at the beginning telling you to not build this beast on shag carpet and to sort out the 5000 pieces before you get started i guess they figure if you got 500 to spend on this thing you can build it however you want as usual we get the regular lego manual features  piece call outs for each step  parts inventory at the end of the manual  page numbers  photos of all the other 2007 sets at the end of the manual manual paperback book provided for scale various manual photos 8x8 plate provided for scale im about 2 hours into building and sorting im trying to stay a day ahead in my posting the build has been easier than i thought so far despite the massive number of pieces it has not been too hard to sort and find what you need build photos will start appearing in tomorrows entry	positive
wow i never thought id be impressed by a box but i certainly am now any chance of seeing all 5000 bricks in a big pile vader on sep 28 2007 1014 am said my gawd that manuel is huge thats enough to put a sane man off of buying this setthank gawd none of us are sane thats all i can say xd too true never had i imagined thinking about buying a 350 lego set beforechristmas is soo close yet soo far	positive
xwingyoda on sep 28 2007 0734 am said tks for that comparison pic dunamis  ok the box is big  i pictured it a tad smaller though  yoda i dont have the ucs isd but from the pic i can see that it is about the same thickness slightly shorter but much wider than the mf so this leads me to believe that dimensionwise the ucs mf is more compact also notice how in the content the parts fit in just nice without additional spare space for anything else strange isnt it that when tlc is responsible for the shipping we see optimum usage of box spaces xd imagine if all boxes were this efficient 499 sets would be no bigger than a match box xd xd the mtt would be reduced to 14 its current size xd xd xd	neutral
great review so far i am looking forward to additional posts as for the number of pins  from the peeron inventory for the set there are over 400 technic pins of various lengths insert the my fingers hurt from building emoticon keep the pictures coming	positive
the minifigs as you can see the minifigs are really nice they even throw in an extra fleshie head no doubt these will fetch quite a bit on the bricklink and ebay markets im keeping mine continuing the build this photo shows how well this model is put together notice that they use four of the threehole beams per side to hold this together i remember reading that you can hang this model from the ceiling i dont doubt it these right angle technic pieces are used to reinforce the structure of the model you can see them used here i was shocked at how many light gray plates are in this set i have two tubs full of these the infrastructure is now complete i got hung up for about an hour looking for one of these turns out lego gave me an extra left wedge and shorted me a right wedge so frustrating i had to stead one off my 6211 star destroyer it is not a very common piece by the way	neutral
hey nice review im up to about the same point as you page 70 to be exact  tho i didnt have that missing piece thankfully i think lego have done a much better job at packing the lego this time i remember it taking me much longer to find pieces on the ucs isd build	positive
so i see they even do mistakes on these  that beast looks really sturdy  that is great  are these yellow parts new  i am not a technic fan and never saw these before another question for you is the instruction book easy to follow especially regarding the colours does the black rally stands out comparing to the dark bley and so on  i sure hope so  cant wait to see moer hehe yoda	neutral
xwingyoda on sep 30 2007 1157 am said are these yellow parts new  i am not a technic fan and never saw these before you dont have the building crane 7905 either same color same shape there piece no 32555 four of them included i assume youre not a town fan p 	neutral
i have been taking photos for this review for a few months and i finally took the rest of the photos last night all the parts if you want tan this is the set to get main model the garage is a great addition but the car only just fits the main house is very nice looking the windows extend to the sides but not the back the chimney and drainage work very well and i love the basement i think the front works very well when i was making this i was multitasking doing weight training do a set do a step do a set and i ended up missing one of the row paths i discovered this after i finished the basement  the removable roof reveals byo floors probably why this is called a model house the roof was quite interesting to build this is my first large house set so it all was very new to me i love the garage door more nice pipework this photo i misfocused but there isnt much to see anyway the door is a nice touch the grill to the right on both sides is not just decoration as it hides the hinges for the door i also made one of the submodels i was considering keeping this but i decided against it once again the sides have windows but the back doesnt the truck is there to make the photo more worthwhile the roof to this one doesnt come off easily as all the tiles are used for the front just to clarify these houses arent attached so you can arrange them however you want the fronts are quite elaborate and it seems that lego were trying to make this almost like a simpler market street the truck is too small for a minifig but it probably was my favourite car thoughts i highly recommend this set in most countries it is good value for money including australia the design is excellent and three instructions are included the third is a school if anyone has made it and wants to post photos feel free at least one person at eb has made it i love how each house has its own car due to the way the primary model is made it is a bit weak at the corner but that was a design choice my only real complaint about this set is how lego is going though a mould transition and thus some roof slopes are rough others are smooth i can accept either and lego has been moving to smooth slopes for years now but to have a set with about 5050 is annoying the mtt was the same but that is my only gripe with this excellent set wub	positive
thanks for the review and tons of pics ive been wanting to pick this one up since i saw it i thought the 4956 creator house was nice but this model town house is in a completely different league i also like the alternate models that you can see in the catalogues	positive
thank you for the review sinner at first i wanted this set for the 4 blue 1x1 slope tiles but i can see there is much more into it than that it sure is a great value compared to what you get in the building bonanzas no cars and less detail it was funny to see the little side story in your pictures would it be hard to modify the cars to fit minifigs better	neutral
i found the use of parts well done by the designers i made a car and then tried to make a house from a different instruction book i could not as several pieces were already used in the car nice to see them using all the parts like that rather than having a lot of extra bits moral of the story one instruction book at a time sweet	neutral
lasse d on sep 28 2007 0803 am said it sure is a great value compared to what you get in the building bonanzas no cars and less detail i was all for the white house until i saw this set i still wouldnt mind it though d lasse d on sep 28 2007 0803 am said would it be hard to modify the cars to fit minifigs better the problem with the blue truck is a lack of headroom however the truck is quite low and i cant see it being too hard to change and still have it looking good asuka on sep 28 2007 0830 am said great for every city builder for sure i guess we waited for sets like that we dreamed about them im glad we got them now  i think lego were really listening with this years creator sets wub with the exception of the ferris wheel they are all sets that you could buy 10 of and not have too many hard to use parts asuka on sep 28 2007 0830 am said edit congrats it seems youve got your bucket back p well in this reality anyway xd who knows what goes on in the wacker and walrus world but i do seem to be a tormented soul 	neutral
awesome review luckily you have two cute little friends and one beautiful lady to help you out p i likewise love wub this set and your review does it credit i laughed outloud a lot as i read it i especially love you trying to look through the windowless back d d d great job now sort that out and start building for our competition xd	positive
excellent review with great pics and cameo appearances by some of our eb favs y definitely a set that was on my to get list already and this only confirms that might make me want two just because i love tan so much and id like to see if something could be done to bulk up that car great job as always 	positive
thanks for this review sinner i love this house with the nicely made tiled corners the colorscheme and the garage the only thing i dislike about this set is the way the windows are attached in train windows so they turn inwards a little instead of the usual frames with shutterattachmentability but that is something that can be fixed in the blink of an eye i will certainly buy this house some day when i find it at reasonable price	positive
i too have bought this set and the only thing i notice which is a bit odd with the exception of there being no floors in the house is the lack of a steering wheel in the car	negative
thanks for the review sinner i definitely want this set now the mixed rough and smooth roof bricks would annoy me on a model like the mtt but here it looks as is if the roof is quite old with some parts being worn and pitted and some parts being replaced with new roof tiles i quite like the effect i agree on which is the best vehicle and if it doesnt fit minifigs just mod the heck out of it xd	positive
sweet looks like an awesome set i might get it i have to see looks like it has a lot of good parts zots	positive
thank you for the nice review i want this set too with al those tan bricks and black slopes and the cute blue car wub i like the old windows more i hope they dont stop producing them	positive
sinner thanks for this outstanding review i am glad that i had read this review in advance before making my purchase on this set earlier with my girlfriend we built this set for a total of 3 hours to complete this beauty in about 2 hours ago there are stars circling around my head at this very moment when i post this reply i must admit from the bottom of my heart that this is an wonderful piece of house that simply shows the beauty of it with the european kind of houses where there is a garage furthermore there is a lovely blue car i am seeing stars right now in the middle of the night and i must drop a thanks to you personally as well although it is empty from its interior unlike the 4996 beach house but this set has the majestic look which simply place a wow factor in front of it upon completion at the moment we had plans for getting the second set next month to build the other design as well hopefully i will be able to share with you guys all of my different creators sets with its alternate designs as well in the near future	positive

remember when i said in my review of 7090 to expect a review after i went to toysrus well somehow things didnt work out but fortunately im finally reviewing my latest purchases starting with 7091 catapault defense which happens to be one of the best sets in the castle line the box and instructions lego box art is at its highest point ever these days with lots of special effects and great action poses the castle theme is no exception and 7091 isnt either ill let the box speak for itself i love the back of the castle boxes as well since they give another action scene and other neat info like a layout of all the accessories the contents only the bare essentials as usual piece bags and instructions i seriously wish they still put mini catalogs inside sets like they did when i was young but i guess they are too expensive to make or something ah well cant have everything no picture of the instructions this time but since that isnt necessary ill just say that they are fine and do not have a problem with distinguishing dark gray from black the pieces heres your basic shot of every piece included minus a few extra pieces like an extra viking horn and black skeleton leg not too shabby for a 10 usd set theres a lot of nice pieces in 7091 as you can see and this doesnt include the accessories or minifig parts the brown plates wheels and spoked things are always useful and the dark blue and gold slopes are really cool however theres also a fair amount of technic in here so be warry as usual for the castle line 7091 has a heaping helping of accessories most of them are old pieces recolored but the ball on chain whats the actual name could someone tell me and the shields are brand new i actually like the new skeleton weapon since its fairly detailed and was really the only way tlc could make a part like that and yes the shields are printed quite nicely too if i do say so myself plus you get viking horns always useful to have a grey boulder a basket and 3 helmets not a half bad deal eh oh who am i kidding  its awesome minifigures ah yes one of the highlights of any castle set you get 2 soldiers and 2 skellies this time all with different weapons the two soldiers are just regular crown troops with different faces  nothing special except that they are awesome anyway the skeletons on the other hand are much more interesting an archer and a black skellie archers cool of course but i know many dont like the printing on the black skeletons well let me say that i dont mind it so much the only real problem is that the eyes are dark red instead of just red which makes the printing a bit less noticeable and ive been through it before that the new skeleton molds in general dont bother me at all  go skeletons the finished set alright theres two builds in this set and ill start with the smaller the skeleton barricade okay so its nothing special but its cool all the less the shield on the front and the slanted spears are nice touches heres just how the skeletons can tower over their own barricade with a little step ah the catapault the lovely catapault seriously i love tlcs design very effective and also very realistic especially compared to kk love the side details and the swiveling base and you gotta love the clever use of that basket playability yes ive made it a tradition now to write stories for any castle set i buy and this isnt the last one you can be sure of that heres one featuring everything in 7901 oh and heres a small ship i made out of all the pieces in this set plus a couple extra figures and weapons from my copy of 7901 not half bad imo considering what i had to work with overall rating presentation 910 pieces 810 minifigures 910 finished model 910 playability 810  final score 8610 once again i highly recommend the reviewed set castle is possibly the best theme this year and this set is one of many that prove it as with all castle sets its best if you buy several if you want to truly enjoy it but this set alone is also impressive in both design and pieces and minifigures get at least one if you have even a slight liking for castle edited by kimt 10 august 2008  0131 pm	positive

its that time of year again when the days get shorter the nights get colder and children all around the world stare longingly into warmly lit toy shops and prepare their wishlist to send to santa this is also the time when the lego group releases their latest winter village set which has been an annual tradition for the past seven years these sets have been very popular especially among afols and are always highly anticipated however while some entries in this series have been more popular than others none has been as controversial as this years set the winter toy shop which is a rerelease of the first winter village set 10199 winter toy shop from 2009 it seems that many think that this set didnt need to be remade and would have preferred a new set instead or that it is not different enough from the original and will be redundant in a completionists collection does it deserve all the hate lets find out disclaimer i dont own the 2009 version so i cant compare them visually but i will do my best to let you know what is different in this version if you do need a visual reference you can refer to sveltes excellent review of the original set number 10249 name winter toy shop theme creator year of release 2015 pieces 898 minifigs 8 price £5999  7999  6999€ sh description quote welcome to the winter toy shop the holiday season has arrived and the toymaker is busy finishing off his latest creations outside children ski and snowboard and a freshly built snowman sparkles in the light that shines from the toyshop tower help decorate the huge tree that stands at the center of the square play with the curious kitten on the cozy wooden bench or join in with the carolers beneath the ornate streetlamp this charming set also features a ladder trees in various sizes jackinthebox a toy biplane helicopter rocket train race car truck robot tugboat teddy bear and a wrapped gift have fun building this enchanting winter wonderland includes a snowman and 8 minifigures with assorted accessories a male caroler female caroler a woman 2 men 2 boys and a girl sh bricklink brickset the box the box art of this set is similar to that of the original but there are some notable differences the christmas tree is on the right side of the image this time while the park bench is on the left and of course it features this years design for creator boxes with the dark blue stripe along the right side and the expert logo in the top right corner theres also a small picture of the back of the toy shop and the background looks less cartoony than on the original the back is also very similar showing a different angle of the toy shop along with some closeups although this time there is no minifig lineup instead the minifig lineup is on the right side of the box it also includes the accessories that each minifig comes with and some of the toys on the left side of the box there is a thumbnail of the box art and the set name in six different languages they also want to make sure that you know that there are batteries included by saying it in dozens of languages the top of the box features the inventory and a 11 scale reference with the female caroler on the bottom there is a picture that reminds you that there is a light brick included in this set in case that wasnt clear from the front of the box and it confirms that yes it is a bad idea to put it in water in case you were planning to go swimming with your winter toy shop the contents inside the box there are two instruction booklets and two groups of bags one for each instruction booklet while two groups of bags is not as many as there usually are in other sets of this size its still better than the first version of this set where the bags werent numbered at all so this makes the build a bit easier the large bag in group 1 and the two large bags in group 2 have a white stripe going down the middle of the bag and only have one group number printed on it along with some other number and some kind of scan code i have no idea why they made this distinction for these bags or what that code is for so if any of you know the purpose of this please let me know in the comments below here is a random instructions page as you can see the building steps can get quite challenging as they sometimes include many different pieces in one step especially when it uses a lot of brown pieces which are very dark and hard to see in the instructions living up to the sets status as an expertlevel set most of the time though the instructions are pretty clear and easy enough to follow there are some parts in new colors in this set that werent in the first version or any other set until now such as that large flat technic arch in dark green the jester hat in orange and blue one of those new 2z2 round jumper tiles in brown a golden frog and a snowboard in dark blue there are also some rare friends parts that make their creator debut here such as the skis in azure and that new clear 1x1 round tile with a tiny tube coming out of it which is usually used as a stand for friends accessories and is a very useful piece especially for snot techniques and no im not talking about the type of snot that many people usually have stuck in their nose around this time of year there are some printed parts as well such as the clock tile the letter tile and the register slope like in the first version of the set we also get a new face print for the white cat which is more in line with other modern cat designs but the best part is the shop sign which is printed this time around it features a lovely wood pattern the words toy shop and a toy soldier on both sides of the sign which is ironic since the shop doesnt seem to sell any toy soldiers like this but it looks so good on the sign that i wont sue them for false advertising the minifigs lets start with the most unique figures in this set the carolers these two were also the highlight in the first version of the set but in the original they both had the same head this one   which featured a very questionable facial expression that could easily be taken out of context in this version they have unique faces which look much better and help distinguish their gender the male caroler uses lord vampyres torso which looks quite snazzy on him maybe this is lord vampyre before he became a vampire the female caroler is easily the best minifig in the set though because in addition to her exclusive head she also gets an exclusive torso and skirt print a huge improvement over the generic unprinted one in the original she also gets the queen hair in dark brown and aragorns lined cape instead of two combined regular capes this set truly is the return of the queen the snowman is technically not a minifig but as you can see here he is exactly as tall as one and he is the first thing you build after the minifigs so i included him here he has mostly the same design as before except this time he has robot claws for arms instead of levers which is good since they allow him to hold accessories such as his broom his carrot nose is included separately again the carolers both have back printing while the snowman looks no different from the back than he does from the front here you can see the black side of the females cape this lined cape is so much nicer than the solution they used in the original next up we have what i assume is a married couple who are likely the parents of at least one of the kids as well as the toymaker who i will call geppetto the man in the pinstripe suit was not included in the first version of the set so hes a bonus minifig these guys are fairly generic but they have some detailed torso prints so they look pretty nice geppetto seems to have gotten younger since the release of the original set since his gray hair has now turned dark tan and he doesnt seem to need glasses anymore the men both have back printing but the woman is the only one in this set who doesnt get a back print why you gotta be so discriminating against women lego last but not least there are the kids one of the boys wears dark blue pants a green jacket and a wool cap he looks a bit like a lumberjack so lets call him lumberjack boy or jack for short the little girl wears an outfit that wouldnt look out of place in the friends theme with a lavender scarf and pants ill call her lavender the second boy is wearing an octan jacket and a sports helmet which makes it ironic that he is the one not doing any winter sports on the box art ill call him president business junior or pbj for short all of the kids have fairly detailed back printing which makes up for the fact that much like the adults they are made out of mostly common parts pbjs helmet and scarf cover up the back of his head nicely which is important as you will see in the next picture whats also great about these figs is that half of them have a doublesided head here you can see pbj doing his best macaulay culkin impression i also removed his scarf so you can see the printing on his torso better but hes not the only one who seems to be easily scared the mother also has a very alarmed expression maybe she got surprised by the jackinthebox or maybe she just realized how expensive toys are nowadays you can see the female carolers back printing here her alternate expression is a nonsinging face which is very nice to have and i wish the male caroler could have one too she looks quite cute with those rosy cheeks but the most adorable out of all of them has to be the little girl she comes with a pouting sad face that will melt your heart please dont cry ill buy you any toy you want just stop looking at me like that the build the first half of the build is dedicated to the surroundings of the toy shop it includes the christmas tree the park bench the snowman the toys the carolers jack and lavender the large bag contains two smaller bags with small pieces a white box that contains the carolers cape and the jester hat in its own little bag the first thing you build after the minifigs and the snowman is the toys this version of the set has a lot more toys than the original which is good because i always felt that the first toy shop was a bit light on toys also the ones that were in the original have been updated for example instead of the two pairs of skis you now get one pair of skis that use the new ski mold and a snowboard the jackinthebox is mostly the same except it now has an orange and blue color scheme instead of the red and blue from the original this change was probably not necessary but hey at least we get a new jester hat out of it and instead of the brickbuilt teddy bear you get the new teddy bear mold i have mixed feelings about this change because i actually kinda liked the brickbuilt teddy design and using a specialized mold seems to be going against the spirit of creator sets but on the other hand i cant deny that the molded teddy looks better than the blocky old one meh the new toys include a tugboat which has some rounded technic pieces as its hull a biplane a rocket a helicopter and a truck that cleverly uses roller skates for its wheels these are all quite brilliant designs that feel like micro versions of lego city sets and make a great addition to the set here is a back view of some of the more complex models as you can see the friends accessory stand has been cleverly used to hold the biplanes fin in place and to provide a stand for the helicopter the jackinthebox has a hinged lid the only thing that bugs me a bit is the tpiece on top of the helicopter that holds the rotor in place but i cant think of any better way they could have done it next is the ladder that is used to decorate the tree which is exactly the same as the first version the supports are on a clickhinge so they can be adjusted or folded away then you build the tree itself you begins of course with the stand which is mostly the same design as before but this time the plates at the bottom are brown instead of white and have golden studs as feet next you build the first layer of branches the main difference in this version of the tree is that this one actually has a brown stem rather than just a technic axle on which you stack the layers of branches one by one you wont be able to see the stem in the final result but i like this change as it makes the tree more realistic then you add the second layer of branches this one doesnt have lightscandles and attaches to the lower layer at an angle using the four transyellow studs close to the stem the third layer is added this one has lights again each layer is similar in that they are all made out of green plates that are built around a 4x4 ring plate but they get smaller each time and are constructed differently enough for the build not to feel repetitive with the addition of the fourth layer we get close to finishing the tree lastly you add one more layer and the tip of the tree now its time to decorate the tree however its not as fun as it sounds since that requires you to add lights to the two chainsropes first which can get a bit repetitive the clips holding the lights to the chain were white but this time theyre pearl gold which looks much nicer in my opinion the next part of the build is the park bench with the streetlamp and the little tree this is a fairly quick build with not much to it the fishbowl helmet parts are a useful piece that you dont see too often so its nice to get them again in this remake the design is pretty much the same as in the original set except for the wreaths on the streetlamp which use a green life preserver instead of a round 2x2 plate this is another instance where they use a specialized piece instead of a brickbuilt solution but im okay with that because unlike with the teddy bear this part was not originally intended to be a wreath so its still nice part usage the second half of the build is dedicated to the toy shop itself and includes the couple geppetto and pbj please note that there is a fourth 6x10 plate burried under the parts you begin by tiling the floor setting up the walls and adding the interior items such as the fireplace the cash register and the toy displays next you add the walls windows and the door and the ground floor of the shop is finished so far the build is the same as the old toy shop except this time they decided to have the white stripes on the marquees be the longer ones instead of the dark red ones for some reason i dont know why they did this and kinda would have preverred to get dark red 1x1 plates instead of white but it doesnt detract from the look of the shop so i dont really care now we begin with the upper floor this is where things start to look a little different can you tell the difference the difference is that this time they attach the roof using cliphinges instead of bulky technic constructions which gives you more space on this floor and allows it to look more like an actual attic they even tile the floor next to the frog clock aftter adding the roof the build is finished the main roof feels a bit loose since its only attached to the building by one side im not sure if this was an issue in the old toy shop but its not a big deal i just wouldnt pick the set up by the roof what i do like is that they used double cheese slopes on the awning on the outer wall of the tower instead of singles which makes it a bit easier to build i like how the supports under the tower roof now match those of the main roof the wreaths have also been updated like the ones on the streetlamp and those technic arches under the roof look a lot more like garlands now on the original they were dark gray so i didnt even know they were supposed to be garlands and assumed they were part of the architecture the shop sign looks a lot better now that it is printed the old one just looked like a white flag i also like how the small plates under the marquee give it a wavy look and they included two trees in different sizes on the right side of the shop the back is nice and open and allows you to see the rest of the toys the robot train and race car all of which have just as much of a simple and clever design as the other toys the clock looks much nicer with the new golden frog because golden frogs make everything better spare parts there are quite a few small parts left over including a roller skate and one of those friends accessory stands which will come in handy the complete set here you can see the full set together it looks quite nice and festive with all the little details and there are many scenes that you can play out with it you can have the minifigs decorate the tree have the kids play in the snow have the carolers sing by the bench have the toymaker build some toys in his workshop or have the parents buy presents for their kids its a festive toyfilled winter wonderland the fireplace looks cozy and i like the brick pattern going up the chimney the entrance of the shop looks a bit empty aside from the cash register i feel like they could have displayed some more toys here but oh well being a set targeted at teens and adults there arent really any play features aside from the light brick which is attached to a hinge so you can either activate it by pressing the button with your finger or tilting the brick upward so that the button is pressed against the roof however since the roof is not connected in the middle and only attached on the sides it tends to split open a bit when you do that so im not sure if attaching the roof this way here was such a good idea nevertheless it looks quite nice when the light is lit ratings design 55  this set is as gorgeous as it was back in 2009 the small updates that they made are mostly good ones although the absence of a brickbuilt teddy is a bit disappointing and the new way the roof is attached while not as bulky as before makes the roof slightly unstable but those are just nitpicks build 55  there are some interesting building techniques here such as those on the tree the roof and the toys the fact that the parts are only split into two groups and the part callouts can get fairly complex makes it a challenging enjoyable build minifigs 55  they did a great job updating the figs in this set while only 3 of the torsos in the original had any printing all of the torsos have printing front and back in this set even the skirt and cape of the female caroler you get two exclusive heads and half of the heads are doublesided plus you get 8 instead of 7 minifigs you really cant ask for more in a creator set playability 45  this set is more meant to be displayed than to be played with but there are plenty of things to play with if you want all the different minifigs accessories and set pieces make for endless possibilities for play its especially fun to swoosh the micro vehicles around parts 35  there are lots of good parts here most of them are fairly common but there are some rare parts and some even in exclusive colors price 45  this set costs 20 more than the original but considering that this set has nearly 900 pieces including some rare and exclusive ones as well as more minifigs with much better printing i think 80 is still a fair price overall 55  so whats my opinion of this set for a remake i think its great they managed to make a good set even better are the changes minor yes are they an improvement mostly yes were they necessary perhaps not but its good that they made them instead of just rereleasing the exact same set so if you didnt get the first winter toy shop i can highly recommend getting this one if you do already have the old version this one might still be worth picking up for the hugely improved minifigs and rare parts alone as for the controversy over rereleasing the winter toy shop i can see where the haters are coming from but i find their complaints to be quite petty i can understand if youre disappointed because you already have the first winter toy shop and were looking forward to a new set this year but theres always next year if youre a completist and feel like tlg is forcing you to buy a set you dont need youre wrong nobody is forcing you to buy anything but yourself if you decide to buy every set in a theme no matter what it is thats your problem not legos so put down your torches and pitchforks and just be glad that they improved the set design and gave us another chance to buy this classic set there are far worse things that can happen in this world than lego rereleasing one of their most popular sets sorry for that little rant so what is your opinion on rereleases like this please cast your vote in the poll above i hope you enjoyed this special eurobricks reviewers academy review and would like to thank the lego group for the opportunity to review this set happy holidays everyone battoys by okay yaramanoglu on flickr	positive
thanks for a great review first of all i do like the upgrades and changes made from the original 2009 set more colours and parts are offcourse available today than back in 2009 it does look like a great set and i would really realy have loved to get it myself if i had the funds however their are so many other sets thats first priority for me this december and next year so sadly i might have to pass on this if its not that i can get it redicioulusly cheap at some point and yeah we should appreciate that lego does keep sets coming even if its just upgrades from earlier releases town is known for a new police and fire station every year cant see why a new toyshop is so upsetting once again thanks for a great review and happy holidays to you as well	positive
nice to see they finally updated that generic screaming face from the 2007 castle line awesome review oky i have the old set so i wont be picking this up	positive
great review i just built the original and this one has clear advantages over the original though i wish lego would stop putting torsos with defined breasts and curves on children i really like pretty much every change i wont be getting it and id be lying if i said im not a little disappointed for the first four years my motherinlaw got me the new winter village set for christmas after the last two which didnt really fit thematically in my display i had hoped for a new oneparticularly since my daughter is getting to be around the age where she can play with them i mention her specifically because ive seen lots of people dismiss those who are a bit disappointed as rabid adults who dont care about kids getting cool sets and i dont think thats fair i may have to see how much some of the parts go for on bricklink the rerelease is better than the original but not good enough that id want to spend 80 to get a set thats nearly identical to one i have edited by tea weevil 29 november 2015  0431 pm	neutral
hobbythom on 29 november 2015  0407 pm said great review you almost make me want to buy one i dont know what it is with these sets on the one hand they are so nicely designed and cute on the other side i never seriously consider buying one i cant explain what it is that holds me back a lack of money maybe thats the thing that usually holds me back anyway i have the older version so i am not interested in this set	neutral
great review thanks oky imo the only significant improvements over the 2009 version are the figures toys and printed shop sign as i already have the older one ill have to give this one a pass	neutral
regarding the reason for the different designs on the inner bags i think that the white stripe is the new version with the nonstripe version being old i suspect the reason some sets have both versions is simply that theyre still using up some of their supply of older bags good review i didnt realise there were quite as many changes as you highlighted tree roof etc	positive
thanks for the excellent review unfortunately it only highlights how minimal the upgrades are though they are nice definitively a pass for me lets hope lego does continue to make the more realistic winter village sets versus santa im not opposed to a rehash the post office could use some improvements for example but this one is just a wee bit minimal	negative
i bought it and im very happy with it	positive
cheers for putting up the review some nice improvements but not enough for me to pick it up the original set is good enough for me pity the poll has no option yes but only in addition to new sets not in stead of new sets edited by withacee 01 december 2015  0938 am	neutral
thanks for a nice review i am building it as we speak and i like it so far since i didnt have the old one i cant complain	positive
thanks for the review they definitely improved upon the original but since i already own the original i cant justify this set also unfortunately it seems to be the trend but im sure there are a lot of first timers out there too that will snatch this up since it is a really lovely building and the updates make it better for sure	neutral
thanks oky for this fine review i agreed with your sentiments on the unnecessary rants i also owned the 2009 version and even though there are minor improvements there must be a logical reason for its release again but is not entirely the same i felt is an excellent opportunity for others to acquire this design especially after six years ago as for myself i will probably buy this if my spare funds allow me to own this set	neutral
thanks for the kind comments everyone i like hearing your opinions on this set withacee on 01 december 2015  0937 am said pity the poll has no option yes but only in addition to new sets not in stead of new sets i dont think that would be a realistic option as that would mean that they would have to spend twice the resources on this theme which i dont think they are ready to do but if more people would like this option i can add it to the poll joebot on 01 december 2015  0833 pm said after mocking people for holding a particular opinion you then turn around and ask people to express their opinion no thanks i guess ill keep my opinions to myself i certainly dont want to be labeled a hater im not mocking anyone i just think that some people need to calm down a bit and that tlg is getting more hate than they deserve for this set but thats just my opinion and youre welcome to disagree with it everyone is entitled to their own opinion including you and me and yes i would love to hear your thoughts on this matter because i would like to have a friendly discussion on this subject	neutral
review  42044  display team jet introduction the smallest of the 2016 sets is the display team jet it doesnt seem to have lots of functionality but maybe the landing gear is retractable this set kind of reminds me to the 9394  jet plane although its obviously a lot smaller as you can read in my review of the 42052  heavy lift helicopter basically anything flying is 1 for me so lets find out if this set also fits the bill note all images can be clicked for hires versions set information number 42044 title display team jet theme technic released 2016 part count 113 box weight 193 gr box dimensions 154 cm x 138 cm x 59 cm set price msrp € 999 price per part € 0088 links brickset bricklink the box being a small set it obviously comes in a small box the display team jet is an aerobatics jet used in air shows on the box its flying rather high but at least its at a safe distance from the crowd front side shows the main model together with a small section indicating you can use digital building instructions to build this model back side the back side shows the bmodel a stunt plane and again a reference to the apps for digital building instructions more on the stunt plane later content of the box the box contains 2 instructions booklets a and bmodel 1 sticker sheet 3 technic liftarms 2 bags instruction booklets both the instructions for the a and bmodel are included in the box sticker sheet a lot of stickers for such a small set apparently no panel is left untouched liftarms three liftarms unsealed nothing out of the ordinary for a small set bags two bags containing the rest of the parts highlighted parts this section describes the new andor otherwise interesting parts yellow 5l axles the 5l axle in yellow has never been released before so its one of the new parts for this year black 7l flex axles for the layman this seems a common part but the 7l soft axle actually has never been released in black before combined with the rerelease of the 19l soft axle in black this will open up lots of possibilities for those of you thinking youve read this text before you are right the new drag racer contains these new 7l flex axles too white panels this small set comes with a whopping 10 panels great for the ones who like panels not so great if you think tlg is using too much panels lately rudder this part the small bionicle wing is the same as the one used in last years 42033  record breaker part list this set contains 113 parts all listed below the build this is the collection of parts used to build the jet it sure looks like we are getting a landing gear the build is fun but pretty straightforward there arent any special or cool techniques used in this set it almost took me more time to apply all the stickers than to build the actual model finished model the finished jet does look cool though the white and yellow color scheme combined with the stickers work really well i have seen people refer to the plane as being orange but its definitely yellow technic or lego in general tends to have some color variation when it comes to yellow i do concur this is the warmer variant of yellow but its not orange the back of the plane looks nice too although i am not a big fan of the rudder part it looks too detailed compared to the other panels its not a big deal though and maybe its just me parts left only three common parts left features and functions this set has a single feature and that is a retractable landing gear its operated by the black 12t double bevel gear near the cockpit in the following picture you can see the landing gear retracted this image shows the landing gear when the plane is ready for landing hopefully the pilot will roll the plane before landing but you probably know what i mean video heres s short video demonstrating the display team jet bmodel this set also includes the building instructions for the bmodel a stunt plane the building experience for the stunt plane is more or less the same as for the jet well what do you expect when both models are planes with a limited number of parts for an alternative model the stunt plane looks fine theres not a lot of functionality in this plane but its worth mentioning that the tail wheel allows the plane to roll on a flat surface the plane also has working propellors both functions are demonstrated in the video unfortunately the landing gear of the stunt plane is not retractable parts left a couple of extra leftover parts but its nice to see that most of the parts have been used in the bmodel as well actually theres probably an extra yellow technic smooth 12 bush left i just found it on my desk but it could belong to one of the other sets video heres a video demonstrating the stunt plane summary two nice planes for 13 bucks thats basically what you get both models look good and the set has some interesting new parts especially the 7l flex axle will be very popular it comes with a decent collection of white panel although they are very common nowadays both models have limited functionality but each of them has at least one function to give the model some playability for kids other than the swooshability that is okay it might lack some proper functions but i still think kids will love this set i can see kids running around with one of the planes in their hands all in all i think this set delivers what youd expect score lets see how this set flies remember that the grades are based on it being a small set obviously a set like this cannot be compared with a mercedes flagship 8 design for a small set the model looks very authentic 7 building experience no surprises 7 features just the retractable landing gear 8 playability it has swooshability so i see kids running around with this model 7 parts lots of panels if you are into that 8 value for money cant go wrong with these small sets 75 fun for kids more image can be found on my flickr page thank you for reading i hope you enjoyed it	positive
very nice little set and a lot of those new white small panels its a need	positive

hi there nice model great review i almost reverse engineered this model but used wrong parts for landing wheels didnt know how to fix the nose proper and so on so i was very interested in this model and i like playing with it i love the reviews but i think i have to mention that the yellow axle must be a 5l the picture shows a 5l and a 5l would fit the size of the model the cart has also a 5l in yellow what sitze is the yellow axle in this seit really 4l as written in the text greetings robert	positive

very nice review for a nice little set i especially like the smoothness of operation for the retractable landing gear i dont like the lack of symmetry for the propeller of the b model though but understand the alternative would be to add one extra small panel to the set or skip two of them in the b model	positive
good review as always jim when i first saw this set i thought that it would make a great parts pack for me as that i have about 20 white pieces in my technic collection all from 42043 and this set has some really useful ones all for a cheap price those 7l flex axles will be extremely useful in my current build im doing	positive
i am definitely getting set for the panels	positive
fixed the video and fixed the stars in the voting thanks for paying attention guys	neutral

boulderer on 27 december 2015  0544 pm said my favourite of the 2016 sets ive built so far id go so far as to say this is the best budget set in years i would have loved this when i was a kid  great swoosh ability  good to hear that im gonna check the toy shops in my lunch break tomorrow see if they got their shipment in yet if they have ill definitely buy one of these little sets	positive

review  42046  getaway racer introduction starting with the 42010  offroad racer and 42011  race car in 2013 tlg released two sets in the first half of each year using a pullback motor the pullback motor allows the model to be pulled back followed by forward motion usually theres no apparent relation between the two set other than the ability to combine them into an alternate build this year there seems to some sort of cops and robbers scene going on a getaway racer and a police interceptor that cant be a coincidence makes you wonder who will be victorious the good guys or the bad guys lets find out note all images can be clicked for hires versions set information number 42046 title getaway racer theme technic released 2016 part count 170 box weight 302 gr box dimensions 260 cm x 138 cm x 59 cm set price msrp € 1999 price per part € 0118 links brickset bricklink the box the box has the same dimensions as previous years pullback motor sets in the lower right corner theres a visual explanation of the pullback mechanism the dark model with its decals sure looks like a cool hot rod content of the box the box contains 1 instructions booklet 1 sticker sheet 2 technic liftarms 1 pullback motor 3 bags instruction booklet just a single booklet unfortunately no booklet for the alternate model sticker sheet the sticker sheet contains a lot of cool stickers with flames and skulls etc pullback motor and liftarms the pullback motor and two liftarms are found unbagged bags a total of three bags containing the majority of the parts highlighted parts this section describes the new andor otherwise interesting parts actually this set is the only set of 1h 2016 which doesnt use any new parts not even parts in a new color tires the getaway racer uses four low profile tires tire 37 x 22 zr rims the rims are wheel 304mm d x 20mm in pearl gold found in 12 other sets panels this set contains three 3 panelsand three 4 panels in black part list this set contains 171 parts all listed below the build this being a small model i wont show any building steps lets skip right to the finished model below you can see the end result in my opinion the model looks great its got that hot rod vibe going on and the stickers add darkness to the vibe slight problem with this set is that it really needs the stickers to finish the look otherwise its quite dull with black and dark grey liftarms and panels the rear view shows the pullback motor connected directly to the rear axle in this image you can also clearly see the exhaust pipes on the side which are very well executed the 3x3 technic discs with stickers used in the rim result in only seeing a part of the rim this works very well with the golden rims the bottom view shows the chassis of the car nothing really noteworthy as you would expect from a pullback set video the following video gives you an overview of the finished model parts left these six parts are left after building the model seems about right features and functions this being a pullback motor set it only has a single feature the video below demonstrates the acceleration of the vehicle my girlfriend was kind enough to catch the model before it fell to the ground or did it hit something before it fell to the ground video this video shows the pullback functionality bmodel the alternate model is a combined build with the police interceptor which you can see on the back of the box unfortunately the instructions for the combined bmodel are not included so i didnt get a chance to build it this would make for a fun challenge building the bmodel without the instructions summary pullback sets are not the most technically advanced models so you cant expect any other functionality than hitting the walls in your house however i think they are very appealing to kids the fact that this years pullback sets form a duo adds to the fun in my opinion tlg hit the nail on the head with the getaway racer and police interceptor the getaway racer looks very badass which is something you dont see every day in a technic set score how do i grade the bad guy in this years duo 8 design it looks so cool but it does need the stickers 7 building experience nothing out of the ordinary 7 features limited to the pullbackanddrive functionality 7 playability combined with the police interceptor kids will love it it does need its nemesys though 7 parts collection of common parts gold rims could be interesting 8 value for money pullback sets always deliver a certain value 73 hit it more image can be found on my flickr page thank you for reading i hope you enjoyed it	positive

lego 42049 mine loader thanks to lego and eurobricks for making this review possible this was supposed to be a previewreview before the dec 1 release date for the set but it got stuck in customs or something and didnt arrive in time well id rather do a good late review than a rushed review so here it is name mine loader set number 42049 pieces 476 i think price 3999 i think minifigs 0 theme technic year of release 2016 links bricklink brickset the box another standard technic box not that theres anything wrong with that it is a littler weird that the mine loader is shown outside the mine but whatever the back of the box again very standard its oddly technical showing the exact angle of the machine when turning but thats the sort of nerdy detail that technic people like the alternate mine cutting machine model looks interesting and unusual as well the 11 part the 11 part on the top of the box is especially helpful with this set these mining machines are very oddly proportioned since they need to fit in mine tunnels so its hard to judge the model size based on the wheels or seat like you can an ordinary set the contents you get manuals for both models a single book for the b and two books for the main a medium size sticker sheet 4 bags and 4 loose tires the special parts this set has 4 of the new mudguard panels in yellow two cylinder halves in red a new color some of the new color red and yellow axles a couple of the newish technic spacers some of the axlepin combination pieces and a couple swords im pretty sure thats an antenna and a spare the start of the bmodel since i like the main model better im building the alternate first so thats how ill write the review theres power for something probably the engine being taken off the one axle here overall a pretty standard technic frame beginning with some structural beams a frame and using liftarms to support axles out to the sides more of the frame the far end of the model has some obvious steering mechanism being formed as well as a pivoting arm right in the center thats probably the connection from the hand of god knob the steering yup called it oddly there is a different turning radius between right and left right now i wonder if thatll get fixed more mechanisms thats looking more technic now sad to see a ujoint being used just as a fixed straight connection like that but it is the alternate model the engine block because all engines should be enclosed in a red cylindrical housing am i right the chassis its definitely coming together now and yes the bmodel instructions tell you to put the stickers on it doesnt matter whether you build the main or alternate first youll get the stickers on almost  there were a couple leftover that didnt get used in the bmodel almost done with the rest of the body done and the wheels on you really get the scale of this machine that blue seat is tiny compared to the rest of it and yes the uneven steering lock got fixed after putting the wheels on you add a couple of pin with ball pieces to the underside to restrict the steering they didnt do that at first so that you could turn the axles sharper while putting the wheels on which made it easier to do the grinder keeping in mind the scale of the machine this thing looks terrifying the tan gear at the back drives the spinning blade up front the red bushes near the turntable let you adjust the angle all done the arm quickly attaches to the body and its done sadly that tan gear doesnt connect to anything  its just a knob so you can spin the blade by hand raise your hand if youre sure i think im dating myself with that title this thing has massive reach im imagining this inside a mine grinding away the rock overhead pretty viciously effective machine the crank on this side of the model is used to raise and lower the arm works well and the grey spacer makes it nice to use since it spins freely the leftovers not much left for a bmodel nice usage starting the main model the main model starts similarly to the alternate with a frame some axles and a drive connection from one axle to something later getting complicated already were only a few pieces in and we already have three separate gear trains going on theres the axle driving the tan beveled gears inside the frame at the bottom theres more tan gears in the middle and theres also a black gear sticking up as a knob that turns the grey connector in the center the body is done i skipped ahead quite a bit but it was a bunch of standard technic building youve got a fake engine with fan at the back driven by one of the rear wheels a knob sticking up for steering and an axle coming forward to open and close the claw the claw i like that they used a link system to open and close the claw instead of just gearing it the axle comes forward from the chassis its the red axle with a couple ujoints for flexibility and drives a worm gear that rotates a gear below with a 2 stud liftarm on each side those arms have pin with towball in them and then a link going from that short liftarm to the claw its a small rotation of the liftarm but makes the claw open widely and works very well raising the claw a few black liftarms join the claw to the body of the loader and allow it to move up and down its a simple mechanism there  one yellow beam goes back and connects to a lever that lets you raise and lower the claw when raised as shown the lever locks in place by going just slightly past the centerline and its done add some wheels a cab and some wheel arches and were done its a great looking machine pretty unique and looks like the real thing the main difference from reality is these usually have a scoop for moving loose rock since weve had so many scooping vehicles in the past tracked loaders the volvo l350f excavators etc the claw here is a fun change and adds to the playability for kids like the real thing the body stays very low so the cab only has to stick up a little bit for the driver to see all around because mines are cramped and busy areas from the rear this angle is great i love the use of the new mudguard panels to make a nice curve to the back of the loader the antenna is a little weird but perhaps they had a big pile of flat silver fencing swords to use up the black gear just to the left of the antenna is the claw control rotating that gear opens and closes it the back end is a little lighter than a real machine would be but lego wanted to leave the engine exposed so you can see the cylinders moving the conclusion so whats my conclusion on this model i like it a lot its simpler than a big set would be but its got lots of design and playability crammed in a midsized set its a unique vehicle however it does have a few flaws the steering on the main model needs some drag added as is you basically have to drive by holding the steering knob since itll bend if you push it from behind i dont like the use of pin with pin hole as mounting points for the orange and red trans plates for lights since they can turn slightly and be at weird angles the antenna is unnecessary and in the way but none of these flaws are dealbreakers or even big deals theyre minor the ratings value 1010  less than 10 cents a piece lots of useful liftarms and such nothing too weird or singleuse design 910  looks very realistic for the size of the set good functionality not too dependent on stickers minifigs na  na playability 910  controls arent perfect loose steering small knob for claw control but very functional and cleverly done parts 910  nice selection although heavy on the standard yellow and black almost zero studded parts overall 9510  its a great intro to technic set  a unique vehicle good functionality nice part selection and decently priced i like it a lot and plan to keep it around as a finished set	positive
great review with high quality pictures well done im glad you took the time to do it properly cool that you have built both models i agree with the mudguards they sure look good on this model	positive
thanks for the thorough comments i agree that the set has some limitations both in construction and realism but i think theyre acceptable given the pricepoint and size the antenna is definitely ludicrous  i really do suspect they had a surplus of the swords to use up and yes the way the steering knob is mounted is loose i also noticed that the ujoints to the claw are not in the right spot like you mentioned but didnt include it since it still works fine that axle coming forward to the claw has a very long unsupported section that does bend a bit when you raise and lower the claw it works but is a bit of a cheat that im kinda surprised they let through i just checked and the bucket from 8043 is a couple studs too wide for this set im betting that was seriously considered but itd have meant scaling the whole thing up and that would have put it into a higher price point or they could have pulled the mold for the 8x14 bucket back out and remade it for this set i really like the model you built and thats interesting about the cabs being basically flush with the top but sticking out the side in image searching as part of my research i found both that style and ones like this with the cab sticking up more like the photo of the caterpillar one in my review i wonder if thats a useuropean difference or different types of mining or what because both styles definitely exist in the real world	neutral
excellent review worth waiting for the set itself is very interesting looks like it may have one interesting build techniques thanks for the review andy ad	positive
think this is the only 1h set ill be getting guess im waiting for 2h for the rest of the construction stuff this set looks okay to me it includes the instructions for both models which is cool and includes some great parts i like that its not just another bucket loader and that it actually tries something different too	positive

cool mod by effe but the original model out of the box is one of the poorest models tlg ever released looks from front to rear as a cheaped out set with really lazy design effort a shame for the responsible lego designer parts assortment seems to be ok but this should not be the most important criteria sry jim i really appreciate your always very well done reviews and offen i agree with the overall judgementsverdicts and of course tastes are different but especially that review sounds like gushing praise in my ears just my 2 ct edit ooops just saw the review isnt done by jimblush so sry jim now my final comment belongs to mostlytechnic edited by kumbbl 27 december 2015  0733 am	negative

quote and the dumbingdown continues now they have to show people to compare axle lengths to the 11 prints on the page that have always been there but how does the 11 work on the app might have to look into that for the record i pulled out my phone and tried to find the app in the google store couldnt find it so then i went to the lego website shown on the page and it had a link to it turns out it wasnt showing up because its tablet only so google wasnt showing it to me on my phone ill try again later with a tablet funny thing is that they changed colour of 7l axle to yellow and on that picture it still is in lbg	neutral

majklspajkl on 05 december 2015  1145 pm said my opinion on the frictionless axlepins is that the flex axle might be easier to stick in them than in regularblue axlepins didnt actually try it though  frictionless pins have accurate round hole while blue friction pins have something squarish flex axle will fit in both but using tan pins doesnt require strength conncetion with tan pins is weaker too	neutral
great review im a bit undecided on the set though it has some nice parts 4 cil engine in such a small set and it looks good but also a bit small and simple not sure if it stands up to the standards of the small tracked loader or similar for sets of this size and as a parts pack for panelsflaxles the display team jet is infinitely better ill probably pick one up but right now i really want another tracked loader last one was sacrificed to the mod gods	neutral
review  42038  arctic truck introduction arctic vehicles arent new to lego back in 2000 the town theme already had several small orange arctic vehicles in 2014 tlg again released a number of arctic sets in the city theme formerly known as town some of these sets are actually pretty big containing over 700 parts looking back in history it seems that arctic sets may have found their origin in the technic theme although these sets were white instead of orange they are unmistakenly arctic the 1986 technic arctic sets contained the infamous technic figures unfortunately the 2015 arctic truck doesnt contain any technic figures but nonetheless its great to see a new arctic vehicle in the technic line not counting several snow scooters lets see if the new arctic truck lives up to the expectations note all images can be clicked for hires versions set information number 42038 title arctic truck theme technic released 2015 part count 1219 box weight 2110 gr box dimensions 478 cm x 280 cm x 72 cm set price msrp € 7999  us 8499  £ 5999 price per part € 0088  us 0093  £ 0066 links brickset bricklink the box the box measures 478 cm x 280 cm x 72 cm and weighs around 1385 grams the box actually feels pretty heavy which means its filled properly this seems to be a trend in the technic theme slightly smaller boxes can save shelf space for retailers the front the front of the box shows the main model and in the lower right corner theres a image with the dimension of the model its 40cm long and 18cm wide the back the upper part of the back of the box shows the functions of the main model the lower left section shows the bmodel which looks very promising more on that later the lower right section shows the motorization options for the main model the crane partially and the bed can be motorized besides motorization some leds can be added as headlights the side on of the sides shows one of the newer smaller style panels this is the first time it appears in orange when you take a look at the sticker you can see that its not symmetrical not sure why tlg cut of one of the sides of the stickers since the position of the panel is very suitable for a continuous sticker content of the box the box is pretty densely packed which is better than semifilled boxes it feels like you actually bought something which matches the box size the box contains 2 booklets 1 sticker sheet 8 bags booklets  sticker sheet unfortunately the instructions and sticker sheet havent been packed with cardboard protection which results in a curved sticker sheet and slightly bent instructions in my case this wasnt so bad at least no real damage highlighted parts this set proves to be a great parts pack especially when you might have missed some of the 2014 sets black link treads usually the link treads come in dark blue grey but this sets includes 96 black treads which is great if youd like to replace the dbg ones in your mocs or other official sets undercarriage and suspension several parts are included to build the undercarriage driving the treads four large tread sprockets and eight small tread sprockets which are used as return sprockets also included are four steering portal hubs and four steering portal axles for driving and steering the vehicle several frames including two cshaped pivot frames and two steering ball joints to create an undercarriage much like the 4x4 crawler the set even includes two hshaped frames aka dog bone frames new changeover catch parts this year 2015 three new parts have been introduced to improve the changeover catch more on these parts later new pin connector another new part for this year 2015 is the 1l round pin connector which looks like a pin connector but acts more like a bush new pins furthermore this sets includes quite a large number of three relatively new parts 17 x pin with pin hole 14 x 3l pin with 1l axle and 11 x 3l pin with 2l axle which have been introduced this year 2015 when the new 3l pin with 1l axle was introduced in 2014 it was only a matter of time before the new 3l pin with 2l axle would appear both new pins are a great addition to the parts portfolio panels last but not least this sets contains a fair number of orange panels including the 3x11 panel in orange which is the first time weve seen this part part list below is the entire part list for the 913 parts as usual this part list can be found at the end of the second booklet the build the build immediately starts with some of the new parts used to build the compact gearbox in the center of the model notice the two 20 tooth bevel gears one would have been enough to drive the 12 tooth bevel gear so the second seems to be useless tlg probably used it in the amodel because they needed it in the bmodel which you can see later the front and rear suspension are almost identical the front side also has the 13l gear rack used for steering the picture below shows the steering rack on the front suspension in more detail at this point you have more or less finished the chassis the gearbox is in place and the majority of the functions has internally been connected to the right gears the small turntable shows where the crane will be attached later on at the end of the first booklet some of the bodywork has been attached to the chassis the orangeblack color scheme never fails to please me throw in some cool stickers for the extra effect and we have a winner if you decide to motorize the model using pf the top of the cabin can be lifted to accomodate the battery box the chassis uses lots of orange and some black panels to give the model its distinctive look the protective black bumberrailing is a nice addition which adds something to the exterior the dumping bed at the rear can tilt to empty its load its operated by a mini la the treads which look very cool in black are driven by a large tread sprocket and returned by two small tread sprockets the front and rear sections are identical building the undercarriages feels a bit repetitive which is a problem for most tracked vehicles finished model adding the crane to the model finishes the build your model should look something like this when you take a close look at the finished model you realize this is something else its trully a unique vehicle the color scheme is brilliant and the fact that its an arctic truck is really neat its a welcome change for the technic line to see a vehicle like this this picture emphasizes thats its a very cool vehicle imagine this beast plowing through the snow as far as i know its not based on a real life vehicle ifs probably a combination of several vehicles and some imagination i can be totally wrong though the rear of the vehicle shows the crane and drum placed on the tipper bed from this angle you can see some of the internals of the model the gearbox behind the cabin for example the crane can be partially motorized rotation and base while the boom is operated manually what i like a lot is the protective railing around the vehicle left over parts some leftover parts nothing noteworthy features and functions this set has several functionsfeatures steering driving suspension crane tipping bed steering as you can see in the image below the steering mechanism has quite a bit of negative caster please correct me if im wrong which causes the treads to rotate a bit upwarddownward instead of only to the left and right driving you mention driving as a feature yes i do and let me explain why normally i would ommit this as a feature and take driving for granted however driving this vehicle on a flat surface causes it to simply slide over the surface for other arctic vehicles this would be a plus but with a tracked vehicle it limits playability this is one of the main drawbacks of these tread they simple dont work properly on smooth surfaces suspension the suspension is working properly you do need to apply some pressure but all things considered its not too bad crane the crane has four degrees of freedom base rotation lower boom upper boom hook it does what its supposed to do base rotation and lower boom can be motorized and switched using the gearbox while the upper boom and hook are operated manually tipping bed the tipping is operated via a mini la conclusion while the set does offer various functions and features driving and steering is a serious issue therefor this set is more likely to be showcased than to be played with bmodel instructions for the bmodel are of high quality looking at the image below you will see what i mean heres the finished bmodel a tracked jeep with a communcations device this alternate model looks so good it could easily have made it as a main model one thing that does pop in mind how would this look with tires more on that later when you are in the artcic region its imperative to have proper communication channels since theres no internet backbone you will need a big antenna of some sort this bmodel actually features a small trailer wagon with a transmitterreceiver heres more detailed image of the bmodel without trailer wagon i would buy this model in a heartbeat if it were a main model simply gorgeous the side view doesnt give away that this in alternate model the stickers also work really well in this model and again nothing to complain here the model even has a small crane at the rear operated by the mini la here you can see the arctic fleet comprised of both the amodel and bmodel i bet these two can get some work done a bit of a messy picture but this should give you an impression of the size of both models leftover parts not too many parts left which is obviously a good thing alternate model with tumbler tires just like me you probably have been wondering how this model would look like with tumbler tires well here it is as i imagined it does look great admittedly these are not the type of tires we ought to use but to be honest i dont really care again the negative caster results in quirky steering the tires are a bit too big so they hit the chassis when you compress the suspension while this has absolutely nothing to do with an arctic vehicle i really love this picture summary were almost at the end of my review so what do i think of this set lets start with getting the elephant out of the room this set lacks proper driving and steering does that make it a bad set definitely not its a great set but it lacks some playability when it comes to moving the vehicle the crane and tipper bed do work properly so theres still some playability left does this set look cool definitely i think its one of the coolest no pun intended and most original models of recent years the orange and black color scheme works great and the stickers are well designed the bmodel is of very high quality and some might even prefer it over the amodel and if you are not interested in either of these models this set provides you with a variety of great parts all in all i think this is a great set maybe not to play with but it scores high on all other criteria pros original model great color scheme lots of interesting parts great bmodel cons steering and driving dont work too well repetitive build of undercarriages minor con score below are my scores based on different categories 8 design original and good looking model 7 building experience fun to build albeit a bit repetitive 8 features packs quite a few features 7 playability some features work some dont 9 parts comes with interesting parts 9 value for money two great model in a single set 8 cool as a bonus heres picture

i could be wrong but i am 100 sure that ive seen this review before	neutral
you switched the sides for the panel with the unsymmetrical sticker otherwise you would see that the cut off part is where theres a beam in front of the panel thats probably done because the beam could possibly damage the sticker either while building or while placed against it for a long time or its simply omitted because it wouldnt be completely visible	neutral

during the annual thanksgiving road trip to the relatives i stopped by the tru in portland or lo and behold the new mars mission sets obviously i bought them  the box not much to say standard box art for mm sets nothing new the parts some good parts here even if you dont like the set which i highly doubt after ive had my say p  its a decent parts pack i noticed that some old parts have been renewed i know the wheel has been used in the 07 sets but the cockpit and hitch i havent seen in a while the vldss very large dss grr new part at least i think it is someone slap me if it isnt wacko the figs i know ive seen that head before but i have no idea where does anyone know i was hoping that the aliens would have new arms at least i was sadly mistaken on the upside i finally discovered that they glow in the dark  the alien has a jetpack if thats not the silliest thing ive ever seen i dont know what is the build simple build a block so easy a caveman cou oh never mind geicos used that one enough then we have this jobber right here not sure what it is but it looks like some crystal scanning device its starting to look pretty nice it almost looks practical the cockpit is suffering from a bad dose of overstickering on the upside we have a new piece there to hold the cockpit on part 1 complete it has a nice little radio antenna which is ruined by the use of a random missile that looks like its going to shoot the antenna before it shoots the alien still i never say no to a good missile i can use for something else the trailer fairly simple but it works it features stabilizing arms a handheld saw and an extremely random minibot whos purpose escapes me the whole meal deal erm general pics overall i thought this was a good set in fact it reminds me of this	positive

great review but am i the only one who thinks this is a pretty homely looking vehicle the small exploration robot is cool but the large windscreen on the main vehicle reminds me about jack stone i also think the bases of the vehicle parts are very basic and look almost unfinished with the holes and such i think i will pass this one even though the alien has a jet pack and there is the nice mini vehicle	negative
tks for the great review mm  its always appreciated to have reviews of new set having said that i really dont see the point of that set and its such money and time wasted imo i dont like that theme apart the dropship and 6wheeler and that tiny vehicle doesnt do the trick for me i see it as a really cheap excuse to try and please classic space fan with that horrendous mm graphics and what amazes me is that you guys loke that d money saved on  yoda	negative

thanks for posting the picture of this new mm set when i first saw the mars mission sets i was a little apprehensive about the design and the aliens they could have at least make movable arms  but anyways when i bought the small fighter i was totally hook my fave set from the line is the mech	positive
during the annual thanksgiving road trip to the relatives i stopped by the tru in portland or lo and behold the new mars mission sets predictably i bought them i present to you the mx41 switch fighter man what a long name the box standard mm on the front it shows the fighter in flight mode and a yellow note telling you that it transforms the back shows three pictures showing it happen the parts once i open the box the first thing that comes out is a bent and rolled up instruction booklet and i was forced to put it under a stack of beer books for an hour then theres the dss yes two of the stickers do feature a cobra i wonder why because this sets decal should be a beatle xd decent parts nothing too special then i noticed this little part its used for the flickmissiles but i have no idea what else it would be used for  the build the alien ship when i looked at the box art for this set i was releived to see that the aliens dont have another curvedforward wing ship instead they have this little beauty which appears to be the alien mini cooper small and hot wub anyway partially completed even if you dont like the set it has some nice green flame peices which work nicely for space laser swords fully completed the only annoying bit about it is that the crystalholding thing in front wobbles all over the place the alien fits into it by way of impalement it must hurt getting in and out switch fighter cockpit the set makes good use of the alpha team cockpit for controls it has a meagre handlebar that the astronaught cant even reach the rear shell of the fighter starts out around the alien containment chamber its a bit odd that the containment chamber has an alien sticker because the instruction booklet lists it as holding crystals the crystal canister is held back by a technic pin this is without a doubt the ugliest color arrangment ever warning mass stickers x the cockpit fits into grooves in the shell then it clicks into place in a 1x1 brick with a horizontal clip the wing mechanism the wing for some reason the body of the mechanism has a blue brick wacko the wing and mechanism connect to prevent the fighter doing a nosedive while in tank mode the wing mechanism completed the underside the body and wing connect by way of a miscolored red brick i have no idea why its red black would bave been much much better completed tank mode all in all this looks pretty neat the wheel base is pretty short but its not bad transform the set transforms neatly if ungainly without antigrav support it would fall forward on its nose each time it transformed jet mode its all right but it could be a bit better the shell keeps slipping back forward to the tank mode because theres nothing to stop it sliding spare parts overall i thought this set was great it could do with some fixing such as the mismatched colors but it should be a definate buy for mm fans brickshelf gallery when available	positive
cool review im actually liking that new missile part as it seems to combine a bar with a pin but its a real eyesore if you ask me	positive
hmm its actually a nice bit better than i expected and great review thanks but think ill pass on this one i quite like the alien fighter though heh and loved the way you described how he sat in the cockpit	negative
very cool review mr mandalorian this isnt a bad set the alien craft is very sleek if only theyd gone with the old alien body in transgreen and the transforming is alright the tank mode looks sweet sweet peace	positive
after seeing this set review it change my mind about this set by the way thanks for the great review	neutral
thanks for that very good review mr mandalorian y i think that this is a plain beautiful set oh how i wish that tlc wouldve taken that direction from the beginning  the design is much more practicable with fewer nonsystem parts and technic beams with studs this makes everything much more easier to mod and a lot more useful at least imo y so its for sure not very hard to make the wonderful enclosed cockpit one brick higher and even that little alien ship looks decent and nice xo and the fighter looks sleek and elegant too in both modes thats just very cool compliments tlc now all we needre aliens with moving arms and here we go classic space on forever xd	positive
wow this is actually quite a neat set it is definitively my favorite in the line after the big drilling unit begingeek im not sure it would nose dive when transforming from tank mode i guess it would pick up speed and transform quickly since it doesnt seem to have any downwards pointing thrusters endgeek	positive
i really like the transforming aspect of this the one thing i wish mm sets would include would be baseplates i liked that about the classic space stuff because it really helped create the environment some red rock orange mars baseplates would be great	positive
hmmm great review for a great set y	positive
lasse d on nov 26 2007 0454 pm said im not sure it would nose dive when transforming from tank mode i guess it would pick up speed and transform quickly since it doesnt seem to have any downwards pointing thrusters the one thing youd have to make sure of though is that it was fairly light and the wheel base had a fairly large surface area actually thats two things so as to make sure it didnt dig into the soil if that happened transformation would be harder as the wheels would dig into the ground and drag through the soil then itd nose dive	neutral
great review mr mandalorian y im not a fan of mm and dont like this set much but it has some neat features but the only way i can see it transforming is by racing off a cliff and swinging its wings out wacko to the brickmobile 	negative
john cleese on nov 25 2007 1056 pm said cool review im actually liking that new missile part as it seems to combine a bar with a pin but its a real eyesore if you ask me a needed solution to those blasted flick missles from falling out while swooshing sweet wonder if the range might have an issue seeing its held in there but who knows maybe they now pop out with a greater velocity than a mere finger flick i had resorted to technic 12 bushings smooth to lock in the missiles technic axle with stud	positive

sweeeet wub its nice to finally see a set thats not bipedal or  tripedal quote exoforce is an anomaly in my lego interests i dont know why i like it so much or why i keep buying it but i do that would be a problem wouldnt it p quote the cockpit itself is constructed very well but the canopy seems like an afterthought closing on to the robots head and leaving his back and sides completely exposed i dunno at least it has a canopy unlike past sets	positive

thanks for this fantastic review hinckley i cant wait to see the comic  i really love this mech as i am a fan of nonbipedal mechs though i am terrible at making them the purple is great and i cant wait to see what mocers will use those awesome new spike peices for 3 robots in one mech is a really good deal too and that spider droid just adds so much more to the set and thanks for taking the time to do this sweet not to sound like a smartypants though but the grill peice in purple is not the first time this has happened two were included in the 06 joker helicopter  thanks again to the brickmobile 	positive

thanks for that very neat review hinckley y this set looks indeed very interesting with a very cool antlike look and a simple but essential overall design the cockpit seems better protected than many other ef ones that spines lovely and the way these iron dronesre attached is simple but effective  and hey did i miss something orre there really no crappy shooting devices p thanks to the minirobots and their inventor i guess 	positive
great review as always hinckley frankly im in love with this thing so much so in fact that ive been calling it shadow panther for weeks but never mind anyway why do i like it well purple is such a fantastic lego colour its sparingly used which makes it interesting and it simply looks great those jetpackbackpack things the robots are wearing and if they are jetpacks as the back of the box suggests then the use of chaisaws is quite nifty and innovative the minibot is cool and certainly an interesting gimmick sure they dont look quite as good in some of the other sets but here it looks great the overall structure and design are cool too its always nice to see an irregular mech and this is no exception its especially cool whee the spines are concerned plus on top of all that its got a nice selection of parts including some lovely new ones and the inlaid box is interesting well worth getting i think	positive
another fantastic review hinckley i really like this set i wasnt to keen on it when i first saw the pictures bit having seen the review i am starting to like it it seems quite sturdy and it makes a change from the usual 2 legged mechs as well as that purple is welcome anywhere i have such a shortage of that colour i like the rusty orange colour of the robots and their backjet packs are quite cool and the mini robot looks sweet	positive

this one is much better than i thought i didnt expect the gun and the turret to be geared i agree that a lot of the details sux hollow inside lame cockpits but as an overall package it looks quite good the best part is no shooter is the nightmare finally over  the bonus robot is a much better idea the large amount of blue pieces make this a must buy for me as impartial needs more raw materials p how well do the tracks work the last tank was too light and it didnt roll well at all  thanks for these photos as well hinckley wub so far the 08 exoforce sets are looking good sweet hinckley on nov 28 2007 0448 pm said and actually i did feel the same way you did about the flying module until i put sinner in it and started to play p wow its big enough for my big walrus head wub	positive
sinner on nov 28 2007 1253 am said how well do the tracks work the last tank was too light and it didnt roll well at all  its similar in weight but i didnt have to press down so hard to get the treads to move barely at all really i think the mobile defense tank although a better overall design suffered from the odd angle of the treads and that was mostly why the treads didnt turn well plus what was with those weird exhaust pipes anyway they are both cool tanks although i like the mobile defense tank better 	neutral
thank you for the glimps at the new set hinckley y  i saw this set today at my local tru store the new slope 1x2 pieces look very sweet  i definitly see great potential for these pieces on locomotives i hope these are going to be bountiful in the 2008 lines model on	positive
fantastic great review thanks a bunch for all the pics theyve shown me how in my opinion bad this set is p i just expected it to be more bricky rather than technicy oh well i wasnt planning on buying it anyway xd i noticed you spelt minifigs minifgis in the first paragraph in case you wanted to know xd so again thanks and im looking forward to seeing the rest of them and the comics peace	negative
hinckley on nov 28 2007 0648 am said cool but my reviews are not meant to sway anyone they should just inform people further as if they want to buy it or not i am not necessarily for encouraging anyone to buy every set i review d but im glad you liked it thank you oh i know but without the info i definately wouldnt buy it now im considering it hinckley on nov 28 2007 0648 am said and actually i did feel the same way you did about the flying module until i put sinner in it and started to play heres a sneak peek of the comic and a cool feature of ryos shipit can be configured in a lot of different ways xo  sinner fits in there well im sold xd	positive
thanks for this great review hinckley  i know youre loving this attention xd p i actually like this set and like it a lot more now that ive seen this review ill most likely get mostly for the figs and parts i reckon it would look a lot better alongside the rest of the 2008 ef mechs anyway thanks for the review to the brickmobile 	positive

i think this is probably my least favourite set of next years selection but i still might get it partly because of this review thanks btw i quite like the minirobot and while there are a few problems the front cockpit the exposed axles i relish the idea of moding them out and correcting them and the change back to the original figs is welcome i didnt really get any of this years sets only last years makes it easier from a mocing potential anyway	neutral

hinkley you are the man your reviews just keep on getting better and better although all of the sets this year are great and i love them all to bits i cant say there was one that i absolutely felt like something id buy except for the storm lasher but with this review i think this will be the first purchase of 2008 for me i totally agree with you on how the spider looks better without minirobot but from looking at where the cockpit is placed and how the skull on the cockpit is lodged underneath the walker maybe the minirobot would look better mounted underneath the head that way it looks more even and even gives the thing a nasty set of teeth i gotta try it out once i get it cant wait for the fabuland comics keep it up hink	positive

i gave this one a 5 its one of the little pirate sets i had during my youth and i loved it for several reasons first of all it contains 2 of my favorite minifigs it can be used as a small independent base or in combination with one of the bigger sets eldorado or trading posts as a lookup or outer defense besides all that this set just looks beautiful i love the colors blue baseplate and the whiteyellow tower one of the best littlemedium sized sets ever made by lego	positive

lord of pies on dec 6 2007 0724 pm said the top of the tower is rather plain and simple which in some ways is good as it keeps the whole set detailed yet not crowded but i feel a little something should of been added to the top though perhaps a catapult steve	neutral
col whipstick on jan 3 2008 1237 am said did i hear right a catapult in the 16th17th18th and 19th centuries wacko perhaps its an appeal for lord of pies to have his own personal catapult to pelt the pirates with whipped cream pastries should they try to sail past but this begs the question why waste perfectly good pie on those scurvy mangy muttfaced villians what a wonderful idea p a pie catapult although it is a waste of a piewe have ourselves a dilemma	neutral
i liked the set but it could have done more plus the strange price of 1550 just seems odd must be the modern pricing systems wacko another rowboat with a pirate would have been good y y y out of y y y y y	positive
lord of pies on jan 3 2008 0851 pm said what a wonderful idea p a pie catapult although it is a waste of a piewe have ourselves a dilemma theres plenty of stale moldy old maggot infested grog around eldorado fortress perhaps thats worth wasting on the scurvy seadogs afterall my men have taken to eating only coconuts brought by islander girls in their skimpy undies xd	neutral
its a fantastic set cant think of anything wrong with it to be honest even if the island is a bit small the plate itself is still useful and the rest of it is also very useful walls can go toward a bigger fort cannon can extend your ship soldiers extend your army boat extends err your boats and the island prin is just cool	positive
its a nice set i would not mind owning one just for the minifigs and cannon the base plate is pretty cool as well nice review i gave it a 4 out of 5	positive
indexed im going to have to start dodging cannon balls soon if i dont start making some pirate mocs pirate anywayz ive had my shell service station set  6378 built exactly by the book and sitting around for the longest time with the recent twinning of my town with dr sinister i needed a gas station that could handle a lot more traffic especially military traffic and these new 6wide vehicles xd  here be a thumblink to the original station at bl i love this station so much but it really needed some modernization the reopening of this station received a lot of attention even the local police stopped right over one big upgrade to this station is the selling of propane tanks which is generally a rare commodity from the lego towns ive seen xd also at this service station is a propane tank refilling station the milkman is our first propane customer the interior has also had an addition and many upgrades for instance this building now has florescent lighting a big frig in the back and more shelf space y oh look theres the officer purchasing a mountain dew now that theres more shelf space we can sell more than just 1x1 round yellow bricks and levers we now have available 1x1 round plates and 1x1 round cones available in multiple colors d with this upgraded gas station hopefully this town will bring in more business and customers into my small town xd p	positive
 i really love everything you did with this gas station it looks very cozy amazing how you said you built it by the book does that mean you didnt have the set but you used your own pieces to rebuild the thing the flourescent lighting is genius and the interior space looks just like what youd see at those little shops i really dig the moc  it gives me good ideas and now i want a gas station of my own p and the history behind how it was rebuilt and how it will improve business etc is so cool wub	positive
legobear on dec 8 2007 1132 pm said  does that mean you didnt have the set but you used your own pieces to rebuild the thing  thanx legobear it means that i have the complete set and have kept it complete until yesterday xd since i like the set so much i wanted to keep the general look of it  p edited by phred 09 december 2007  0627 am	positive

lol those star wars heiroglyphics are awesome were those in the movie or is this just a joke by the lego designers that would be the first time tlc showed any kind of reference humor the rest of the set is great too even the skeleton and the stickers yes thats right i actually like those things i like the new skellies because of their posability im a big supporter  user of stopmotion and i think theres nothing wrong with stickers i mean seriously why does everybody hate stickers so much  sure they are a pain in the megablocks to put on and sure they come off after a while and are never usable again but hey you dont have to put them on even better you can save them like i do and use them for your mocs could somebody tell me please im just curious however as i said nice set i might even get one gotta love that marion with the carot torch xd and that arc is neat too by the way are all parts on it golden some more pics on it would be nice as soon as your camera is recharged  thanks peace out	positive
this and motorcycle chase were the two sets ive wanted from the start i like how you get lots of snakes and ill add my snakes in too for a brickfilm sometimes i like the stickers but all my world city ones got hard and fell off  i like the r2d2 could you take a pic of any hieroglyphics in this setnot the ones on the sticker sheet thanks i want to decode them	positive
my 2nd review what a veteran  again found this set via a shop assistant in my local tru portsmouth uk this evening comes in at 4499 which is pretty steep but you get quite a bit for your money front of the box  back of the box  back of the box closeup  contents  it was a nice surprise to get numbered bags  not had a large set with numbered bags for quite a while at least in none of the sets ive bought recently didnt take a close up of the stickers but i was quite disappointed that the curved pieces had stickers  if they could print the att curved pieces why not these minifigs  oh  and theres a nice backprint on the pilot figure  now the build was pretty good  you build the plane first after the minifigures quite an interesting build in a way becayse for a while you think the back is the front  and then you realise heh now  ive not seen the film in a while but i dont recall a guy flying a plane with a fishing rod  dont flame me if this is what happens see earlier point regards not seeing the film in ages p after that you build the temple in stages starting with the entrance first and then the holey floor section with the spears these spears are just loosely placed into technic holed bricks quite easy to make em flick out but they can go anywhere hehe entrance  holey floor  spears  these two parts are hinged and on an angle to each other and the gap makes for a handy bottomless pit complete with pole for indy to swing over with his whip after that you create the door and the ratchet mechanism to keep it raised after that you add the runners for the ball and the swinging knives trap swords trap  before  after  finally you build the statue that holds the efigy nice bit of construction here especially the way that everything falls over once the efigy is removed do be careful when putting the curved bits on though  it appears one of the edges on mine has slightly bent when putting it on  nowt noticable though temple  preparing to steal  run you can see that the temple has toppled and debris has fallen all around  and then as he goes through the door the door falls he gets his hat and then the rock ball starts a rolling ruuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuun the stickers were a pain though  theres no room for a border around the sticker here beware after all that is done you join all the pieces together and it makes more a really good playset plenty of opportunity for recreating scenes here idol closeup  total set  spares  yet more spare stickers sorry ive already put the spares in my box of bits overall 8 out of 10  lots of play value and a pretty nice build too many stickers though  and defo poor arms for the skeletons edited by imperialshadows 01 june 2008  1218 pm	positive

i just noticed another inconsistency between box art and the actual set  on the box the biplan has white wing supports theyre just plane windows without glass in them and yet the set they are dark grey or is it bley  can never tell the difference without careful study add to that  the outer of the engine at the front is white on the box and black in the set we dont normally have this many inconsistencies do we 	neutral
this set is so cool and another must buy  im in trouble next year it seems the figs are great wub i think the plane is only ok perhaps they should have made that in a separate set as it needed to be a certain size to fit the figs but that meant that the tail is way too short here is a picture of the actual plane so you can see what i mean notice the pilot is fishing   the temple is another story i think lego have done an incredible job with this fitting in the key parts of this sequence without making an absurdly large model addtionally there are many parts in this set that i havent got so it shouldnt be too hard to justify xd thanks for another great review sweet i love the photo of indy running with the idol and the boulder close behind p naith on dec 16 2007 1020 pm said lol is it just me or in the earlier concepts of this set we saw a native on the box i wonder why they removed it  wacko i recall that too  edit yes there was one big pete on dec 16 2007 1128 pm said we dont normally have this many inconsistencies do we  quite annoying ones too i think the plane looks better with those being white	neutral
because of exams and other obligations i havent posted this sooner seeing that noone else has reviewed this set i thought i might as well do it myself the set in its entire glory minus the slammer instructions and the obviously massive sticker sheet the four cars included in this set a muscle car a sports car a roadster and the police offroader because the police obviously have no clue that an offroader is useless for catching streetracers no less a batmobileish sports car it will always trail behind but the police have a trick up their sleeve  the drawbridge gotcha and the mechanism that makes it all tick the motor is nothing more than a slow pullback motor push down the bridge the latch will hook on to the gear and keep it in place until the latch is released and theres the new gas station staying within theme this gasstation is like the tanker in 8147 from the company fuel 4 speed theres a notable presence of detail here such as the sodadispenser water coolant bottles and other accesories two fuel pumps and bumperlevel railings to prevent cars from crashing into them theres no interior however and as demonstrated here by a loyal octanemployee and a pursuing officer the gas station is built to minifigscale my impressions of this set as a collector of tiny turbos and yet to miss a set i got this one regardless of what it included the gas station is indeed very nice and the minifigscale accesories were unexpected the lack of interior is no big issue and the both the station and bridge can with ease be implemented into a minifig town the bridge also solidly built and includes the ramps in its design so it can be lifted with ramps attached without breaking apart the slammer included in the set is identical apart from the white color with those in 8147 the cars are also very nice altough i am yet to get used to the yellow batmobile as ive grown accustomed to calling it i also love the offroaders chunky tires they make perfect wheels for the newer minifigscale cars i never consider priceparts ratio and here it would for me be irrelevant because it will never be demolished for parts the play value is what i would consider pretty good and while the bridge wont rise with a car on it its still strong enough to stay open with a car tipping over the edge hmm every nerve in my body is saying that this sets is worth roughly 810 so verdict 810 edited by whitefang 23 may 2009  0701 pm indexed	positive

i enjoyed seeing this review nice to get some different angles on the components sorry to disagree with anyone however but this was not a great review i appreciate the effort sandra made but a great review would include more details such as what are stickers and what are printed pieces a great review points out flaws or limitations as well as what works or is really neat a great review would have analyzed the price per piece and compared that to other setsthemes one might look at the recent reviews of the indy sets or the new spongebob sets as examples of really good reviews the pictures are good but a great review above all should provide the reader with some new information perhaps even answer questions posed in the prerelease discussion thread i learned nothing new about the set from this review that said it was a good review for someone who had not seen the prerelease discussion and she did a good job of showing said person what they could expect in the set	positive

kimt on jan 4 2008 1025 am said btw which set would you recommend market streeet town plan or cafe corner just curious theyre pretty expensive and i might only afford one of them i guess it all depends on what you are after kim if you want a really great and detailed set i would opt for the cafe corner but if you want a set that can easilly be included in a city i would opt for town plan since i cant afford all of them i will just get town plan because i lve the feeling of thge set and that theater is superb  yoda	positive
kimt on jan 4 2008 1025 am said btw which set would you recommend market streeet town plan or cafe corner just curious theyre pretty expensive and i might only afford one of them definitely the coffee corner its a hard desicion between coffee corner and town plan because they are both really great sets the market street is no must have in my opinion but the other two maybe you should start with the coffee corner its the older set the town plan is newer and will be available longer then the coffee corner i hope it helped you a litte bit  regards sandra edited by legocastlegirl 04 january 2008  1043 am	positive

i was fortunate enough to get one along with the hobby train they are the first trains i have ever owned mainly by virtue of them having been half price its a fantastic selection of parts with the holiday train as well as it really looking the part as a set im happy not to get a motor as i think the 9v setup would prove expensive and the ir control system for the rc setup seems a bit poor i got some dead track for with it to have just as a push train for now	positive
got one for 90 usd one of the best trains everfunny as train perfect for parts what else to say y	positive

wout on jan 5 2008 0927 pm said a druid battle pack would also be a nice idea for the castle sets may i ask what you paid for this my first and second idea was that 25 euro was a bit to much for this  xd whatever p bloody typo i say however the upcomming castle advent calendar might include druids p i paid 30 for it  dang 1 cent more expensive as sh d  trudop561 on jan 5 2008 1121 pm said they released the battle droid commander in 2000  yes another nice tone meessa so happy  first you are very welcome for my review of a set present in your wishlist then the commander you are talking about has a tan body with oreange markings only check  and the commander here has a full yellow body like in the spiderman set doc ocs hideout 4856  therefore those 2 commanders are 2 different mfs yoda	neutral

great review as weve come to expect from yoda y nice to see that tlg is finding new and interesting ways to get around the no minifig only sets restrictions with hasbro clearly this is another army builder with a minimal vehicle as were becoming accustomed to heck even the diminutive hailfire is technically a droid as well thus making this all minifigs from a certain point of view only negative it is a bit overpriced ill have a better feel for that when i get one treadslinks always drive up a price so it might just be fair the spiderdroid is a winner even with the unusual parts assortment i like it when lego thinks of different ways to use things i think it promotes the same from us im not sure what i think of the new battledroid commanders but at least i can make extras easily if i need to as i bought a bunch of yellow droid bodies off bricklink once thinking i might want to make some kind of new droid out of them they were cheap at the time now i expect the price to go up just because of this potential use between those and the grey ones its good to see more becoming available hopefully well see black and a few other colours produced for some nice customizing possibilities all in all a nice little set with a great army building potential especially on a buyonegetonehalfoff or better type of sale until then ill grab one or two and be glad to have them	positive
i got this set for a few months 1 or 2 and i agree that it is small but still it looks great on plates clone troopers just for fun 	positive
i got this and a couple of other sets on mondayand to tell you the truth i was a bit dissapointedi like the set i like the parts but its definitly not worth its rrp of 45 nzd if you ask me i should be more like 35 nzd but hey i still like it i got it for 30 on ebay so im not complaining y y	negative

great review yoda thanks for sharing i wasnt real fond of the postal truck at first its so different than those in the us but after seeing your closeup images esp the back of the tuck it looks really neat i also like the mail box a lot it looks good in red too bad for the stickers but its still nice the plane reminds me a lot of the design used in the jurassic park set as youve said its similar to 80s designs i really like the brickbuilt design too its just real lego  thats about all i can say very nice sets that are a must together thanks for the review	positive
excellent review you convinced me to buy these two could you tell me how much you payed for them i think im gonna buy them tomorrow if they have it already or if i dont see any cooler sets	positive
i havent spotted these in the us yet im looking forward to finding them overall the 2008 lineup is a excellent and its going to be difficult for me to decide which themessets to pursue theres a lot to choose from	positive
nice review yoda i dont think i have ever read one with as much cursing of stickers d i love these two little sets the colour scheme the little different wheels on the post van and of course the new postmen uniforms would have been nice if they had included little satchels like in the new indiana jones sets oh well  postman yoda on yoda	positive
thanks for the takes on these two sets yoda stickers or not i still think these are charming sets with all the essence and nostalgia of the older sets back in the 8090s am i the first one to notice the new doors used in the back of the van not only is it using the popular new frame but the old container doors have been redesigned to fit with the new frame as well pity theyre not yellow though	positive
very nice cheers yoda ill definitely be getting the post van not sure about the plane though both are awesome but i think i have enough planes can you tell me though the wheels on the van are they rubber or plastic they look a bit tacky	positive
these little sets are really nice they cought my eye the minute i saw them it would have been so great if there was a post office to go with them there are so few buildings in lego city the design is very classic and i am ofcourse considering to get them but it seems that i have a lot of small cars and planes on my desk  recently i took a flight with cyprus airways from thessaloniki to cyprus and the two promo plane sets were there i was so tired though that i couldnt stay awake to buy them im taking a flight again on tuesday and i hope they are not out of stock thanks for a great review yoda a fine job as always cant wait for your next one	positive
aww man is tlc really getting too cheap for printed parts shame on you tlc despite those stickers these are two really neat sets especially the airplane classic wub reminds me of that little plane my dad bought in an airplane not sure whats the set nr the window at the rear of the van looks like a normal window frame without the clips for the shutters i never knew those existed 8 might come handy for ship building thanks for the review yoda	positive
thank you for the nice review pity of the stickers but the design is nice 80ies on	positive
great review yoda i find myself saying that line alot d  i love these two little sets wub tlc continues the great city line that started in 07 and continues into 08 its also nice to have other sub lines besides fire and police  p i hope there are many more postal sets like a post officethat would be sweet hope these are mainstream and not those damn exclusives  postal on p	positive
i need to do some catching up here p matn on jan 5 2008 0516 pm said could you tell me how much you payed for them i think im gonna buy them tomorrow if they have it already or if i dont see any cooler sets i paid a tad more than the sh price i paid 15 for the plane and 8 for the van sure its a tad more expensive but i didnt want to wait for tru to get them freddie on jan 5 2008 0610 pm said am i the first one to notice the new doors used in the back of the van not only is it using the popular new frame but the old container doors have been redesigned to fit with the new frame as well pity theyre not yellow though great remark there i guess i totally missed that one  and i agree that yellow doors would have been better but those dark bley do not look that bad  mr hobbles on jan 5 2008 0910 pm said can you tell me though the wheels on the van are they rubber or plastic they look a bit tacky rubber off course  they do look a tad tacky but its because they are the thin type like with the racers and i am not a fan of those  phoinix on jan 5 2008 0935 pm said cant wait for your next one tks  me neither though p marvinblue on jan 6 2008 0331 am said i reckon lego could enhance this subtheme by releasing a post motorbike with or without a sidecar and post office obviouly the office would be the hub of all the activity while the post bike would take care of the postal run this would free up the van to take or recieve bulk mail or parcels to or from the airport it could then also do the parcel deliveries around the city the office would also serve as the reciever for all the parcels the new goods truck might deliver so true 8 at one point i was thinking of a impulse set with a yellow bike postman post and letters that would rock  i hope tlc adds to this sub theme and keeps that retro feel wub a yellow dirtbike with sidecar would be a sweet 5 set  also a small town feel post office would be so cool like a 2030 set  we can be sure of one thing though this years advent calendar will have a postamn and small post office  post on  yoda	neutral

well first off thanks yoda for the great review  hmmm well i have to say im not at all impressed with any of these sets i mean there nice and all but the van just seems way to small it would have been nice if you could fit more than one package in it i guessim one of those that are more of the fan of the 6 wide trucks and the plane hm this has a cute factor and all but i mean comon you have to open a hatch on the roof to get your packages in and what about getting them out you have to flip the plane upside down  weak they should have had a hinged rear end or a hatch on the side	negative

thebrickster on jan 5 2008 1012 am said i wasnt real fond of the postal truck at first its so different than those in the us good point b this design is just too foreign to my eyes for me to enjoy i dont like either of these sets very disapointing  the postal theme has so much potential i dont really like the torsos either  too plaincheap as kanal suggested and i will agree that the wheels on the van look cheap i was sooooo impressed with city 2007 this is a real let down though i am happy to see a small set with a postal box so even though all that aside ill probably buy 6 of the van  just for the yellow mudgards postal box and stickers to populate my city and i think this set will provide some excellent piece to moc a yellow civillian convertable with sweet  bm	neutral
5150 lego on jan 6 2008 1108 pm said well first off thanks yoda for the great review  hmmm well i have to say im not at all impressed with any of these sets i mean there nice and all but the van just seems way to small it would have been nice if you could fit more than one package in it i guessim one of those that are more of the fan of the 6 wide trucks i see your point that more cargo capacity would have been better nevertheless my personal preference is for smaller classic scale city sets the mail van is nice and small and should fit well with my road plates and 1990s cars from the 4561 train on a side note did anyone notice the message on the back of both sets boxes designed for easy building and instant play it surprised me a little since these sets seem no less complex than any other city set of late they look like quick builds sure but not as though the designers went out of their way to simplify them	positive
thanks for the great reviews yoda the car looks great y and the plane is very cool too and much more suited to a lego town than the large planes on xd peace	positive

beach house reviewed by dunamis set 4996 522 pieces 2995 from target build time 90 minutes yet another interesting creator theme house this one comes fresh of the 2008 line of sets and promises 3 different models packing 522 pieces albeit a lot of 1x1 plates for only 2995 it was hard to pass this one by as i was foraging for the new 2008 star wars sets at the local target plus i was itching to do another review since i had finally fully recovered from my marathon ucs falcon review which took the better part a month to complete the box the box is pretty standard creator type box which shows off the three models beach house caf and towering apartment building the back of the box shows some of the features of the three models interesting features of the three models prominently displayed on the back include  food counter complete with coffee espresso maker and food warmer with chicken leg  home office complete with laptop and the ubiquitous coffee cup  flip up roof granting access inside of beach house note the satellite tv dish and even rain gutters along the roofline opening the box is a matter of breaking two seals were back to the reusable cereal box type tab system that we saw so often in 2007 sets note the parts inventory is on the side of the box as well this is a nice feature once inside the box we are greeted by eight sealed bags plus two yellow 16x2 plates and a green 32x16 baseplate thank goodness there is no dss dreaded sticker sheet but alas there are no minifigs in addition there are the three manuals one for each model and they were stuffed into my box with the care of kid trying to put 10 gallons or liters if you prefer of candy in a 5 gallon bucket but hey were not collecting manuals here so who cares if the manuals are all bent and warped the manuals the three manuals are 74 72 and 48 pages in length they are laid out well and are pretty standard with all the usual trimmings  piece call outs for each step  parts inventory at the end of the primary model build  page numbers color separation in these manuals were fine for me plus we get the usual verbose lego instructions on not dumping all your pieces outside in the grass and not to dump all your pieces into a single pile thanks for the tip tlg parts list the pieces pretty standard stuff here and as i mentioned lots of 1x1 plates and tiles at least 100 however we do get quite a few windows and a couple of doors a majority of the color is black and yellow i did see a few pieces that i was not familiar with so im going to show them below keep in mind im not a parts jockey so bear with me if i think a part is brand new for 2008 and it was actually released with the classic space line 2x2 window fixed and 4x3 window that opens the follow photo shows the window glass same as in corner caf door glass and new black parts turns out these black parts are used as wheels i showed the window glass because it still contains the molding circle just like they did before it is hard to see from the photo but it is there the door glass i think might be new i dont recall seeing these 2x2 round plates with clips before and i thought i would show the mail only because it is printed and not a sticker i know these are common but didnt they have four studs on top these only have two how about this sloped 4x3 window that opens overall a nice assortment of parts with nothing juniorized the build the build was fun and was fairly straightforward once you figure out which of the three models to build it goes pretty quick here are a few shots see how the inside is made look at the detail with the flowers and even the outside water faucet outdoor seating area upstairs being built upstairs with opening roof notice the satellite tv dish check out the patio on the upstairs complete with outdoor light and rain gutters heres my favorite the bbq grill at least we know where those new parts go finally check out the tree no juniorization here here is what is left over so far i have only built the primary model the others look interesting especially the caf the design the design was well done very rich in detail i love how there are no juniorized parts the house is accessible by taking off the top floor like caf corner and market street there is an internal staircase as well there is no interior to speak of in the beach house but there is in the other two models the only real negative is that it is kind of small when you get it done it would be nice if it was about 50 bigger here are a few views of the beach house with a few minifigs thrown in check out the closeup of the caf which i think looks great also here is a photo of the interior of the apartment building where you can see the office and computer overall thoughts it is a really nice set a tad on the small side but it has some great detail and lots of features quick enough to build all three models and would fit real nice into an existing town plan is minifig scale but does not come with any lots of window parts and black slopes is a nice diversion from the onslaught of clone wars ships that we cant remember seeing from the movies final rating 84 build 910 pretty quick and fun functionality 910 it is a creator set so you have multiple varied builds diverse enough to keep the kids entertained design 1010 excellent and well thought out outstanding detail for such a small model parts 610 fair nothing earthshattering but lots of slopes and windows price 810 price ratio is good but you get a lot of little parts would be better with minifigs edited by whitefang 23 may 2009  0638 pm indexed	positive
thanks for that really nice review dunamis now it is even more harder for me to wait for this set i hope my legostore will get it tomorrow it is really nice im a really big fan of the creator houses but that one is now the best one for me i love the colour of it and of course the windows at the roof wub creator house on greetings sandra	positive

thanks for the review dunamis this is a great little set im also very impressed with takuto20s mods ive been trying a few of my own i liked the tower block design but a lot of stuff needed fixing firstly i added a 4th wall and made it so the storeys could be lifted off like in the other models i also added flowers on the windowsills and doorways out on to the balconies still to be added is an extra door for the top floor which im going to get from the new doors and windows pack i added a chimney that goes all the way up the back of the house and has a fireplace on every level each floor is fully furnished with a fireplace wash basin and bed on the upper levels and a corner sofa and coffee table plus an extra large fireplace on the ground floor finally here is my idea of what to do with two copies of this set all the parts pictured are from 2x 4996 except 5 extra fence panels and the minifigs the house on the left has its garden at the rear	positive
1 before buying even if i am city fan those new sized planes are really not mine cup of tea my love to lego is firmly frozen somewhere between years 19801995 main reason to buy was that i wanted to write a review at czech afol web kostkyorg i bought it three days ago via web advertising price was  35 usd 2 after opening the box as presumed some very big parts and three bags and as an additional bonus lot of danish air free of charge first sight told me that this will be really short and easy building 3 impressions during building and it was really true 30 minutes of lazy building bag 1  plane bag 2  plane gondols with supports bag 3  wings and propellers when i saw the way how is this plane made i was strongly thinking to play money for nothing from dire straits as a music accordant with whole set 4 impressions after building  lookout juniorized creeps this is my first plane in this scale and for 99 the last one lack of details lot of ugly big parts from whole set you can see the main development target  to keep rrp at some certain low level inner space of airplane absolutely undone no details no luggage no computers nothing at all just a lot lot of air the very only details in whole plane are the stickered pilots desk and some kind of seat constuction 5 impressions after building  playability but what is playability at this set hydroplane which cannot float as seen on enclosed photos  if tlc will make some new kind of big parts used for gondolas to make the plane floating they will for sure make no other damage juniorization couldnt be higher you even cannot drive across the carpet with the plane so how to play open the doors open the cabin part and turn with propellers weak weak weak 6 resumed impressions sadly i must say that at limited release sets tlc boat seems to sailing to the worst part of the coast after quite good 7344 perfect 7899 and 7900 strange but acceptable 7998 juniorization came back with 7906 followed with this ugly playmobilized 7732 7 final word in fact even 15 usd seems to be too much for this kind of set 35 usd expected rrp in our country is really overpriced to hell neither set nor minifig is not interesting tlc maybe knows about juniorization as well as nowhere on the box the number of pieces isnt written if you my afol friends want to spent your bucks better give half of the price to african orphans you will save your money and you will have a good feeling all the photos you can see below as i cannot upload onto this topic due to some limit httpwwwkostkyorc15954newnew edited by kanalk1 16 january 2008  1032 pm	negative

am i the only that one that thinks it is not so badwhat i am trying to say is wouldnt planes be this big in real lifei know it has a lot of big pieces but how would they make them any smalleror how would they the big pieces into a bunch of tiny pieceswell any way i do think in some cases that if there is any juniorized involved it should be with duplo complaning off	neutral
thks for this caustic review d ill wait for the parts on bricklink i think youre a bit unfair with this small oversized submarine  oups sorry i mean plane here are some advantages i tried to imagine  1 thats the first submarine with a plane nose 2 thats the first unprinted nose 3 thats the first shark that make me laugh and which has a plain white fin 4 and at last you should have notice that that the first submarine with a wing made of several plates it is said that this set has more than 200 parts hide and seek  xd you may have lost several bags im eager that people buy this set a lot  id like to buy a lot of these new white 4x4x2 curved slope for my mocs can you take a picture of the plane crashing in the sink  is it fire proof  i think that will be too easy this year to decide what is the crap of year 	neutral

i have to agree with almost all of the replies here that this set is the most ugliest looking lego set i have ever seen if i have never seen this set and ppl showed it to me i would have thought it would be some little kids moc or something no offence huge juniorized pieces bad color theme i would say it would look better if the wing is white no interior and huge dss i will avoid this set like the plague i own the entire city line except for the airport and planning to get all the city stuff that lego releases but this set will ruin my plans coz i will avoid it unless someone gives it to me for free haha wacko boo lego boo x	negative

legoman132 on sep 11 2008 0626 pm said this still looks like a cool set but the price not so much the price is now €20 in ireland on sh which is reasonable considering the large fuselage pieces has anyone modded this set to make a reasonable looking plane i am thinking of buy it to do so but i dont want to take a risk and end up with lots of useless pieces aswell as €20	positive
hello and welcome to another redman set review well actually the first redman set review im your host redman and today i adorn my medieval outfit to tell you about the impulse set simply titled the knight this is a great set with 14 pieces 2 of which are spare and a minifig with 2 weapons 2 helmets and some shiny armour all this is packaged in a tiny box just short of 10 cm or 3 inches with a neat little instruction manual that folds up to the size of the weapons rack included in the set as you can see this set only costs a measly 7 nzd disclaimer redman not included here we see the box clearly showing what the box holds on the top we see a 11 scale picture of a minifig for those new to lego or who have forgotten how big a minifig is i guess  xd the instruction manual showing the nice and easy built with me for size comparison d sorry about the dark image i had to lean over the light to get a birds eye pic  here we see the 2 different soldiers you can make with the set a knight and a guard or standard troop or soldier or whatever you want to call him note each set comes with only 1 minifigure and additional accessories of course you know im in the picture just for the sake of it im not really one of the soldiers xd the neat little weapons rack or rather equipment rack as it holds not only a weapon but a shield except the ovoid ones helmet and armour nice and easy storage so your equipment wont get dirty lying around on the ground d one of the spare parts is another of those robot hands so you can stick that in place of the shield and allow the rack to hold 2 weapons just thought youd like to know that  and here we see the nifty little structure of the thing it can even support a whole minifig note the grey stud on the bottom bar is a spare part i just find it better used there to hold the armour  huh i dont remember this picture 8 it appears i drifted off and these guys dont look too happy i overtook their weapons equipment rack  i should go xd so in conclusion this is a great set for army building at a reasonable price with nice equipment and it can be picked up as a little extra with your normal shopping xd thats all for today folks sweet redman so what do you think should i continue with these redman reviews  p or just stop now xd comments and criticism welcome  peace	positive
nice review iamded id better go and check toyworld tommorrow sweet shame about the price though only 3 more dollars to get crossbow attack  iamded on jan 19 2008 1244 am said and here we see the nifty little structure of the thing it can even support a whole minifig d batbrick on jan 19 2008 0136 am said edit btw is it just me or does my new avatar make me seem a bit creepy 8 batbrick youve always been a bit creepy p xd	positive

looks like an ace set  i may get this just for the sand green troll even if im not a great castle fan i do want one of them things wub i also love the goblins new metal flaked helmet and the same style with the wheels they look very nice the chicken leg fishing pole is always fun too 	positive
nice review sweet this is a must buy for me since i wub the new sand green giant troll now i just have to wait until its available in the us  general tarful	positive
thanks for this excellent review vader it seems you are succumbing to the castle side of the force i love the new helmet and the new orc torso is fantastic as well which is great to see that the troll faction has many ranks too the troll himself i love i agree with you in saying i prefer the sand green version the battle wagon is cool one of the better wagon designs and the flag is a great touch which improves it sadly the back is rather empty but a few modsll change that  and of course this set includes the infamous chicken pole one pic request if you have time vader could you please post a few pics of the new helmet on its own and on a human soldier please batbrick is back 	positive
thanks for the review vader the first picture of the troll is great the gold armour really shines xd a fantastic set ill definitely get a couple of these wub as for the ogresgiant trolls the dark tan one fits in the mine setting well but for above ground settings i prefer the sand green one y peace edited by iamded 19 january 2008  1021 am	positive

thank you for the review vader that set looks worth buying 8 i think you gave me a good reason to buy it 	positive
great review vader  as ive said before this is a nice set but doesnt really come with anything that doesnt come with the other sets of the line for this reason it will be somewhere at the bottom of my list for 2008 also i like torso and helmet of the dwarf mining orcs much better the colours make the torso look rather dull and boring while the other more brown one looks much clearer and more exciting i think i like the knight helmet better too looks more covering and threatening than this one although ill save my judgement until i have one in my hands thanks again vader  edit forgot to mention hilarious pic in your sig vader d edited by tinypiesrus 19 january 2008  0828 am	negative
thanks for the review i love this set its a cheap way to get green trolls and i love the new helmet it looks great and i think it will be very usefull for other factions as well sweet dnl	positive
mr tiber on jan 19 2008 1116 pm said a troll driven by a turkey leg what a wonderful little detail d d thanks for the review vader very clever using a flag to hide that crazy firing device i find it rather odd they used blue pins for this black or gray wouldve been alot more discrete about the big trolls i think using different colours is good i dont think a troll force would be very organized so different colours would make the effect complete y  as for your troops looks quite fearsome definitely compared to my pathetic number of soldiers  a nice set but i would rather get the attack on tower though no matter about the price difference oh dont get me wrong i love the dark tan troll i just prefer the sand green one your right about trolls not being organized and i like to think that the trolls are from different areas etc	negative
vader on jan 19 2008 0132 am said am i the only one who thinks this helmet looks a bit like the juggernaut from xmen	neutral
vader on jan 19 2008 1245 am said heres a few quick shots of the 2 larger trolls we have so far i prefer the sand green one nice comparison shot judging from these pics i think i have to agree with you that green suits the troll better especially since the orcs are sand green as well indicating some relation between the two races if they are indeed separate races great review very detailed and with lots of pictures i was already interested in this set but after reading your review i want this set for sure y	positive

tks for the review mate  now i have to bloody wait long because lego france has this line available in freaking march  pissed yoda on  d i love the new goblin p that helmet is really cool why on earth tlc didnt include that one in the dwarf mine  such another idiotic move  anyone keeping track of tlcs stupidity lately  that would be interesting  i clearly want a huge goblin army now hehe  and i totally agree with you mate the troll lokks better in sand green the cart itself is pretty lame imo  just a sordid excuse to include yet another annoying shooting crappy device but for a 21 set its okie i say  need my bad guys on  yoda	positive
thanks for the review of a set i would otherwise probably have passed on out of curiosity how did you know it was for you you seem to be building quite a collection why castle now was the fantasy element all it took just curious thanks again and god bless nathan	neutral
lego city truck  forklift set  7733 pieces 343 price 2499 usd store of purchase toys rus release date january 2008 after discussion of the mysterious yellow cargo contained in this new city transport set and a visit to my local tru i purchased this set i was immediately pleased with the pricepiece which i think is pretty reasonable 343 pieces for 25 starting with the box great city artwork boasting special edition tha backside of the box no alternate models comes as no surprise the dreaded decals i was looking for the skull and bones for radioactive but no such luck my favorite part of the set a very clever forklift side view and the backside what i like about the forklift is the bars across the top giving the vehicle a reallife design the double wheels in the front with two pieces that can hold the wheels also adds to a clever design i like the figs although not much new  perhaps ill make the driver into a werewolf later the set includes three cargo pallets the first some sort of fuel with gauge the 2nd two indy containers and a square 2x4 brick i have not put the decals on yet and the mysterious yellow cargo your guess is as good as mine   on to the truck the front section the front grill another angle the back i like the opening mechanism that is very simple but works well also is the large plate tile piece inside i like this because the entire interior has no studs and the trailer section of the truck orange and yellow tail lights and the rear trailer open the complete set summary this is a neat set that reminds me a bit of classic lego city but larger it is very playable and has a lot of accessories adding to the value the build was very simple and enjoyable took me about an hour it is a great addition to a number of city sets including the cargo ship container stacker the world city cargo train and the new cargo plane as i mentioned previously i have not yet put on the decals that im sure will really add to the overall look of the set the forklift is awesome and i like the cargo containers the truck could have benefited from a few additional details chrome smokers and an undercarriage box that really opens considering everything i would buy this set again hope you enjoy and perhaps this mysterious cargo will make its way into a brickster mystery y	positive
the forklift is amazing and nice design of the opening side doors aswell thanks for the review i may actually pick this one up 	positive

brickmaster on jan 19 2008 1227 am said its either that or its a toysrus exclusive set as my armoured drilling unit box also had special edition on it special edition mean that its a store exclusive set the cargo theme is a tru exclusive and another example is thr tie crawler is exclusive to target also can th doors be opened on either side	neutral

highlandcattle on jan 20 2008 0915 am said this set looks pretty good to me it is six wide isnt it that is nice for a truck like this yes 6wide the only problem with these big trucks is how they look on the city roadplates ive always thought too big compared to classic city trucks getting off topic id like to see lego make a car transport truck i dont think ive ever seen one in lego it would definately have to be 6wide or even larger	negative
5150 lego on jan 20 2008 1150 am said great review my only grip with this set is you can only fit one pallet in the truck it should have been the same size as the trailer so you can at least fit 2 pallets seems like alotof wasted space if im going to transport cargo i want to use the maximum amount of space aviable xd thats a fair gripe someone else mentioned it above as well i thought the same thing when i went to load it	neutral

greetings and welcome to another redman review im your host redman and today i adorn my medieval outfit to tell you about the impulse set simply titled the knight no wait thats the old script xd i mean the good wizard sweet the other castle impulse set the first being the knight this is a wonderful and in my case unexpected addition to the castle line i did not expect to get a nice good wizard but rather another plain white skellie for the impulse and was pleasantly surprised when i saw the first picture of this set the impulse sets give you pieces you wouldnt expect to see in such small sets for example the knight came with the armour and this comes with an owl a gem and a crystal ball piece it comes with 11 pieces including the wand owl and gem and no spares which doesnt really matter as it doesnt need any the box sports the set number age range which i blissfully ignore xd awesome castle logo and the assembled set with the usual 11 scale picture of a minifig the back of the box shows pictures of the boxed skeleton tower and kings castle siege sets note the price is in new zealand dollars and is really the same prica as any other impulse set next are the instructions which are separated into 3 parts 1 for the minifigure 1 for the table and one for the bird stand very simple also worth mentioning is the parts numbers are next to their respective parts for replacement parts etc on the back we see on the top half pictures of skeleton prison carriage skeleton tower and kings castle siege this time not of the boxed sets but the sets themselves on the lower half we have 8 pictures each of the different impulse sets the wizards torso is plain sand blue with no patterns or anything but it doesnt really matter is his beards in the way  the head is that same old white fade to grey beard head but the white beard covers up most of the grey my favourite part is the pants i love that were getting printed belts and legs again his belt has 4 gold crosses as seen in if you look closely the new crownies torso and the crownie archers torso and a belt buckle and the legs have a bottle a coin and a small bag nice little wizardey items the er items no accessories no models the stuff in the set include a little stand for the owl and a table utilising the new 4x4 round piece in light bley with the crystal ball in the middle encasing the yellow gem held on by a 2x2 circle piece in blue why blue im not sure maybe its because the crystal is yellow and the crownies colours are blue and gold so the blue piece with the yellow crystal symbolise the crownies colours or maybe tlc just felt the need to include an odd colour p in conclusion this is a wonderful set with some neat accessories and it doesnt really need to be bought in the masses after all you needs an army of owls and wizards  p so it works fine as a single set and adds a more fantasy feel to your crownie army thats all for today folks sweet redman thanks for reading another of my redman interviews any suggestions on how towhat to do to improve it is greatly appreciated as are all comments and criticisms except those blatant thoughtless criticisms that dont help at all p peace edited by kimt 10 august 2008  0131 pm	positive

well since noone seems to have done one for this set here we go heres the complete set in all its glory yes i really like it but then tabletown has the capacity to support it and my green army have their eyes on it as a potential military transport as well  ill start out with the little airport ground car thingy  very neat and functional here are views front and back next up the steps which allow the plane crew to embark and disembark and to round off this little trio the cargo loading platform here in its lowered position note the prong thingy sticking out from the rear and here raised the prong thingy is now hinged up to support the back of the platform and keep it level heres a slightly different angle so you can see the pieces under there the allimportant cargo itself hmmmnot much for a plane this size the cargo pallet slots neatly onto the loading platform heres the complete set of ground equipment  all attached and so onto the plane itself note that unlike the other large planes the main wing sits at the top of the row of bricks making up the side of the fuselage i took it apart a little so you can see the internal construction of the fuselage note that the cargo area is really small right at the back what else is this thing carrying illegal immigrants  a picture of the rear of the fuselage just because i like the sticker front landing gear way better than on the other large planes i dont know if this is a new piece or what but ive had no problems with it at all and my kids have been playing with it as well the rather sexy rear undercarriage  this area reminds me of one of those giant russian transport planes  wicked those angled grey slopes atop each side of the rear undercarriage annoy the heck out of me as they keep coming off whenever i pick the plane up i think a 1x4 plate on top to bind them together might solve that a slightly blurry view sorry from underneath the gear looks like it might be capable of retracting internally but alas no this is a shame as theres certainly enough room in there and its a wasted opportunity imo might have to modify that a view of one of the four engines i personally think they look too small and should have something under the wing as well to make them rounder cockpit crew door open i love the smooth action of these doors and the way they seal flush against the fuselage when closed cargo door open crew door with docked ladder cargo door with docked loading platform cargo slots inside and locks into place the same way it sits on the loader neat the minifigs sorry this one is a bit blurry and that concludes this weeks show and tell dr s	positive

lt veers on feb 4 2008 1142 pm said i do admit the amount of cargo is rediculously small but it still looks good say how much can the plane hold thanks for the review sweet thats all the space you get now it might be possible to rip out that rear bulkhead at the back of the wing and fill the middle area with tiles so cargo pallets could slide up the fuselage but that would definitely prevent the undercarriage folding internally if thats what you wanted to do as well dr s	neutral

thank you very much for a good and informative review doc sinister y this looks like the best of the bigplanes to me very nice and smoother than the rest  although like youve said what the heckre they transporting diamonds and pearls so much wasted space and the landing gear should really fold in n	neutral
i loved the pics in the catalogues but was a bit disappointed by the build and end result my own thoughts cons  as noted the cargo space is really small considering the size of the plane although i can see this is restricted due to playability  without the barrier in the middle the cargo would slide all over the place while the plane was being swooshed  the cargo lift im not sure how else to describe it is very weak and snaps off although it is a clever design i think its badly implemented  there is nothing to hold the cargo pallet to the cargo lift truck so it tends to slide off all over the place as soon as the truck moves  colour issues  i had at least 3 shades of green with the larger plane pieces and noticeable variances even with identical cargo hatch pieces at least one of them also came quite scratched which was a little disappointing  at 7995 aud its 10 more than the passenger plane was with less pieces and figs and no printed pieces whatsoever more  for less methinks pros  lots of nice cargo crate pieces and even the stickers for these are pretty good  landing gear piece adjusts very well to height differentials so the plane doesnt lose its gear as often as the earlier passenger planes  the hinging mechanism works very well to open the cargo holds  opens very smoothly and is not noticeable  id definitely like to see more of this technique  the little vehicles work well chained together and are all good small designs overall  i really like the large planes since 06 but i dont think theyve still quite hit the nail on the head whereas the earlier planes were a little flimsy this one is sturdier but has its own issues the look of the cargo plane is nice and the new landing piece and cargo hatch pieces are really great but some design weaknesses and colour issues detract from the overall product its a shame as with a bit of tweaking this could have been a musthave set	negative
wow thats a great review of a great set dr s y as you yourself have already noted this has the potential to be a fantastic military moc with a bit of modification you can get the engines to be rounder or perhaps do away with them completely and replace them with jet engines sweet though i cant think of a system to retract the undercarriage at the top of my head it seems like theres indeeed more than enough potential to do so it reminds me rather of an ilyushin il76 one of my favourite cargo planes 	positive

tks drs for your cool review  i admit tht this plane is way better than i imagined  even if i still dislike the new hull the engines and landing gear are really improved and the way to operate the crates work really well  tks for sharing these pics  yoda	positive
hairy ruben on feb 5 2008 0433 pm said really i love the way they look granted they go back to the 70s but so does the 747 or the c130 you cant argue about tastes and colours i guess p dr s  how much did the set cost its 3499 on sh but i got mine as part of a bundle theyd put together  7731 mail van  7732 air mail  7733 truck  forklift  7734 cargo plane all for 6456 dr s	neutral
cardinal brick on feb 5 2008 0849 pm said thanks for the review i like the looks of the set but im not sure about it still is it work 35 would you recomend buying it well i can only speak for myself  i like it worth 3500 well its a big box for that amount of money but full of big parts of course i dunno  could do with being cheaper but then im sure we all think that of our favourite hobby 3000 would be nearer the mark imo dr s	positive
the amount of cargo that huge plane carries 8 green peace would have a field day xd nice review dr s but this set is just too big for my town scale  edited by casewindu 05 february 2008  0954 pm	neutral
nice review dr s i have been thinking long and hard about the scale of the planes in my town i would like to keep my passenger planes in their classic 4wide fuselage style but i really dont mind the new plane hull pieces if they are used as an enormous transport plane like the ilyushin76 unfortunately i cant afford this lovely new green one at the moment which would be perfect to go with my green army as i took too much of a hit buying the new 2008 star wars sets but i have modified my white one to take huge cargo loads in fact my apc is designed specifically to fit inside unfortunately im a bit busy to take pics at the moment but hope to put some up soon	neutral
dr s i was not planning on buying this set after my disappointment with the other large airplane but after looking at this image review i just might buy the green color is really the aspect that makes this airplane stand out i think it looks great thanks for the review	positive
thank for the review doc the only thing i like in this set is the small car so i will not buy this set just for it i really dislike those new planes toooo bbiiiigggg with this size this cargo plane can carry just fiew things what a shame i think that the way tlc has made the wings is not very good like the rest of those big pieces just my thought the positif point of this its that it makes me saved some money d	negative

at my local walmart there was most of the 2008 sets including the indiana jones ones  i picked up this one and the motorcycle chase name 7621 lost tomb price 2000 parts 277 figs 3 box art first off we have the great indiana jones box art i must say the designers did an excellent job on it i love the little temple design with skulls as well as including indy in the right hand corner the back of the box is just as cool showing all the neat play features of the set as well as an advertisement for the indiana jones game figs first off we have our hero indian what the hell why is there a freaking cw anakin head on indy there was a production slip up as instead of indys head i get anakins   i open the box up and there staring me in the face is his ugly face tlc is defiantly doing to here a gnarly complaint from me  ok now here we have the  real indy fig that is supposed to come with the set d i just noticed that his fedora hat goes down in the back bonus picture time here is a jacketless indy with his sleeve torn off like he looks in the temple of doom sweet the next figure up is our lovely marion wub wub wub plus her head is reversible with a scared face xd love the new hairpiece in black finally we have our undead skellie with second style head and poseable arms the well of souls the set itself is a nice model and playset the anubis statues are very cool and i love all the hieroglyphs on the walls 8 here is the sw link with artoo and 3p0 xd the ark in its resting place the ark removed its very cool indeed but tlc should have made the whole thing in chrome gold  not metallic gold with brown and yellow the closeup of the anubis statue yes the eye is a sticker but at leasts a gold color playability first off you can pull the pin on the anubis statues which send them falling and taking out the walls behind the wall a skellie swings out there is a lever in the back of the model where you push down and the snakes shower down upon the figs hehe with the snakes all around marion is both modeling with the new carrot torch and fending off viscous cobras d in the meantime indy uses his whip to scale the wall and avoid all the snakes which he is afriad of in the meantime leaving marion behind to fight them off p the whip is bendable but it will always snap back into a coil its some type of bendy hard plastic scoring figs 910 model 810 playability 8510 overall satisfaction 410 would be 910 if it wasnt for the stupid anakin head error in the end this is a charming set and could easily fit in with the adventurers it has the cool anubis statues as well as the ark plus indy marion and a skellie great selection of figs but sallah would have been better since he actually removes the ark with indy however i am still wondering the point of the anubis statues this set does seem pretty silly p p	neutral

i got mine today xd i too got an anakin clone wars head although im not really complaining since i already have an indy head from the motorcycle chase set it is really odd that they would pack in such a different looking head though also for those that think the head has no use try placing it under one of the braided new brown dwarf beards it looks pretty nice i think y on the set its wonderful the hieroglyphic stickers are wonderful marion especially her head and hair is wonderful and the anubis statues are nice too theres also lots of nice tan parts such as 20 round 2x2s and 8 1x8 bricks all in all its a great set for the price and i cant wait to get race for the stolen treasure and temple escape now sweet	positive

hello and welcome to another oh wait first batbrick and iamded review today us two sworn enemies will be reviewing the creator cargo chopper here is the front of the box and while pushing iamded to his doom here is the back haha ouch oh dearhere are the parts anyway here is the instruction of the first model the cargo chopper i love creator sets for the different models they always excite me just ignore me finishing off my nemesis in the background something very interesting that i liked in the instructions was this step where you must add those three 2x2 yellow rounded pieces under the chopper this is for support while you build which is handy and later you take it off and even later use it as the cargo i found that to be rather innovative and clever as well as  hey what are you hitting me for both instruction booklets have the same back now heres the chopper itself i love the design of it it isnt quite minifig scale but its great all the same this is my first nonxpod or house creator set and it sure is fun here me and iamded go for a dizzy ride i love the nose of the copter and the landing gear is fantastic a shot from the other side oh dear it seems weve been a bit sick from that ride and were vomiting transgreen 1x1s the cargo itself is nicely made though i forgot to put on two tiles here   it fits in real well with the chopper to and the line is great for giving iamded the wedgie he deserves this is my first power function set so i was pretty excited the motor is intergrated really well into this set and is activated by pushing that little 3x2 plate with the 1x1 slopes on it forward until it hits the motor button that orange knob another point of interest is the use of bley barrels on each side i like this as i dont have those pieces in that colour a shot of the motor its really simple all you do is pull the hook out to any length that allows then press the orange button and it will wind it back up this makes the chopper pull the cargo up into its bay and iamded pull me here reluctantly to a whacking a top view is that my head a view of the chopper without the cargo in it i love the lowered cockpit the leftover pieces from building note iamdeds head does not count as set piece and a final shot of the set with me and iamded oh it appear were dead oh dear hope you enjoyed this review soon i will post the two alternate models i loved this chopper its great to play with and has nice construction it also has some handy pieces too the motor function sounds like a gimmick but is well intergrated into this model well worth the price so far this is another win for creator i say so far i recommend this model but later well see if the alt models are up to scratch also since this is my first review comments and criticism welcome on everything batbrick away  edited by whitefang 23 may 2009  0637 pm indexed	positive

6258 smugglers shanty overview smugglers shanty was released in 1992 it consisted of 69 pieces 3 minifigs two pirates one imperial and it cost 925 usd the set itself is a small but rather sturdy den for the pirates review the minifigs consist of two pirates and one imperial the minifigs are not all that rare which is disappointing i would of liked a rarer fig but still it is a good cheap source of pirate and imperial figures here is an overall shot of the set which includes the three figs the shanty which is made using palm leaves pieces and a nice grey shark nibbling at the soldiers oar a close up of the soldier rowing hard in his boat i would have preferred to have a normal soldier with shako hat as i have more officers than normal soldiers now and a close up snap of the main structure note the wine glass which was a nice touch funnily enough only 4 pieces of treasure were included in this set compared to the usual 8 gold coins in other sets a view from the back which also gives a good view of the pieces used to construct the shanty mainly simple black 1 by 1 bricks the shanty looks good from most angles but their are a few where the roof construction looks rather odd but that is just a minor nitpick yet another view from the front this time at a slightly different angle the yellow base plate looks rather nice too i prefer it over the tan pieces we trend to get nowadays attack the stupid drunk pirate in the background does not even notice overall i think this is a rather good set despite some shortcomings such as the lack of treasure and odd roof from some angles the shark imperial soldier and useful parts make up for it and of course the price is cheap on most auction sites i got mine for a mere 5 10 with the cheapest price on bricklink being 8 rate the set then leave your comments thoughts and opinions	positive
first ill comment on the review and at a later date ill comment on the set youve done a top job lord of pies y youve captured the set from a variety of angles and posed the minifigures interestingly	neutral
very nice review lord of pies thanks for taking the time to put this together and especially for all the detailed pics y i very much regret that my dark ages occured when they did basically i missed out on all the cheap and easy troop building sets and this one is certainly no exception the big sets are nice but these are the ones that always make me wish just a little harder for a return of lego pirates  i gave it a 4 out of 5 just because id buy 4 out of 5 sitting on the shelves today were it possible	positive
great little set i bought this set only a few years ago misb and i am still very happy about it the hut is simple but very effective as a castaway building on some deserted island the palmleaves are a good addition to any lego collection this set had a nice amount of weapons two for each pirate and two of those weapons are flintlock muskets as opposed to just pistols nice poll as well but you made sure nobody can give this set a 1 which is very nice but probably a little mistake d  i gave it the toprating y	positive

i bought one of these new from bricklink a few months ago as part of my pirate splurge i went on i really enjoyed this set because of the amount of figs in such a small set though pirates were always pretty good about their fig count also the neat little hut is nicely done for its purpose great review btw	positive

well since this topic has resurfaced i would add my 2 cents about my appreciation of this set it was the first and unfortunately the largest pirate set i owned as a kid but i played the wazoo out of it some of the minifigs have lost almost all their face printing after so many play sessions theres just something about the hut that appealed to me more than the cheesy skullface islands we keep gettingprobably that it wa kind of neutral good for my pirates settlers or islanders though the palm leaves were rather fragile and used to break off the studded parts it would be nice to get more of these beach village army builder sets edited by ardelon 21 september 2014  0340 pm	neutral

great review pictures and all thanks for showing all the mechanisms of the tower i didnt notice them from either the pics we had or the instructionsit didnt hit me that when you knock down the wall the second floor breaks that is a genius idea this looks like a superb set unfortunately my priority right now is the troll warship still if that really is us 80 i might skip it and go for this instead which is only 20 us one note though i think there might not be a back cage on the second floor of the tower so that the mechanism can work did you try to see if the second floor ground still falls if you add it a fourth cage wall also you could just pretend that the tower is built against a mountainside it would fit perfectly and add more defense to the knights great review  vk	positive

xwingyoda on mar 1 2008 0632 am said its still looks good but the crappy rubber band system is really not well thought off yoda i totally agreed with your comments the rubber system is not effective at all i bought 2 defenders recently and i found out that when the wheels move the rubber just stuck there without rotating the blades at the front  i have not really found a solution for mine yet so far i only took out the rubber band placing the blades on the ground removing of the red technic part on the left side in this way when the defender is moving on smooth ground the blades will move too 	negative

truly an awesome review thanks dunamis i ordered my two copies one to build one to store in the vault last week cant wait to get this one the attention to detail here is what makes the set great theres nothing to criticize about this set its really the closest thing to perfection that i have seen from tlc the difference between this set and cc is the interior detail and because of that gg now become in my opinion the best set ever released by tlc do the ccggms sets fit well with the 50th anniv town plan my impression is that out of the box at least they dont which is too bad however i dont think it would be hard to mod the town plan so it looks like it belongs in the same town as ccggms these sets to me are what i have always wanted from tlc as an adult i hope they keep up the line and add more elements to this excellent lineup	positive
thanks for all the feedback as you can tell i really enjoyed building it cardinal brick on mar 8 2008 0926 am said is it the first set youe given 100 to yes it is i gave cafe corner a 96 and i felt this was a better set and improved on the things that i dinged cafe corner on lack of minifigs was one thing thats why i enjoy reading the comments so i can see if my ratings are in line with what everyone else thinks and to see if i missed anything i cant wait for some of you to build it and share your thoughts as well	positive

afol sf on mar 8 2008 0629 pm said a very informative review indeed thank you so much for doing so now i know that the price is worth every penny leaving my pocket  what do you guys think is tlc putting up as the next modular set is it asking too much of tlc to produce 1 modular set each quarter 4 times a year i would vote for a bank next	neutral
great review thanks for taking the time to do this this has been a great line at the risk of abandoning my castleadventurer loyalties ive got to say this is rapidly becoming my favorite line and this set looks to be the best of the lot while it still hurts to shell out 150 i think ill still be happy to do so steve	positive
thank you sooo much for this amazing review dunamis i absolutly adore this set and youve review has prompted me to certainetly start saving i have a bit left over form christmas that will come in handy d  i love the little fridge downstairs the fire escape and the mouse hole alot more good ideas that we can all use in creating our own buildings this line is by far my favorite lego line ever yes even beats starwars but only just   hooray for dunamis xd	positive
ive got something i want to share with you a beautiful dream came true 1 the box top back the alternate model is also very well done the pneumatics dump the bucket and open the flap  open you can see a diagram how the pneumatics work just a happy kid playing the plastic inlays  all 2 the parts as you can see 8854 offers a very large variety of different parts loads of technic bricks gears and even plates also note the threaded axle 10 5 large pulleys a big turntable and the 1x20 rack 3 building the mechanism for the outriggers and the rotation of the turntable the turntable the pneumatics are finished the mechanism for the telescope the finished model 4 random shots you can see how the turntable will be rotated thanks for reading erm viewing the pictures please comment if you want to	positive
really cool set this has convinced me that i really want it	positive
cp5670 on mar 10 2008 0553 am said the old tubes also grip the nozzles much more firmly and if you arent careful when removing them its actually possible to rip off the nozzles completely xo i actually noticed that while taking it apart but didnt really pay any attention i just thought thats because its an old part well thanks for the information	neutral
great pictures especially the perspective from overhead this is one of my favorite technic models because it packs so many features in a relatively small space and im working on documenting this one in technicopedia right now thanks for the photos eric	positive
thanks for another fun review this set is high on my list of things to buy i love cranes built many and bought many including the classic 8460 from 1995 and the more recent 8421 that threaded axle never stopped intriguing me it was use in so few sets i believe 8851 contained one as well and i still dont know why its better than any other axle congratulations with a near mint copy of this set 	positive
simonwillems on mar 10 2008 0132 pm said that threaded axle never stopped intriguing me it was use in so few sets i believe 8851 contained one as well and i still dont know why its better than any other axle the purpose of the threaded axle is to carry tension regular axles are used primarily for carrying torsion for gears sometimes for compression 8855 landing gear helicopter skids and sometimes just for looks roll cages canopies but used in tension connectors will usually just pop off with the threads and the corresponding nuts this part can be used to squeeze parts together like the pen in the plotter of 8094 or to hold heavy assemblies onto turntables like 8862 and 8851 with the power crane 8854 reviewed here that is the complete list of sets which used this part i wrote about it here httpwwwericalbre1984htmlparts eric	neutral
as i bought it i didnt even know i would also get a box it just said all parts with building instructions after opening the parcel i was like woah woooaaahhh and so on  i love legoboxes because as a child i stood in the toy stores starring at the boxes only seeing the front and the back nothing more this brings back some memories 	positive

this was my first technic set aged 7 still a great one in terms of function density and a great bmodel in the uk im certain it was called the salvage hoist	positive
hi this is my third oldschool technic set review i dont want to talk much please enjoy just the pictures 1 the parts 2 building the two axles you can see in the middle are not connected and dont belong to each other the axle on the left side is for the steering on the right side for the engine the darkgray technic gear 16 tooth with clutch allows the connection from the differential gear to the engine trough the axle for the steering the v6engine the winch thats a part you dont see everyday a 1x2 rack it only reappears in 2 sets from 2001 and 2004 the rebel wrecker has been released in 1994 the front double wishbone with antisway barsuspension yeah i got it from technopedia xd  the finished model 3 random shots i really like this picture authoritative isnt it 8 d thanks for viewing the pictures please comment if you want to	neutral
thanks for reviewing all these old sets will you be doing any more	positive
nice pictures i also sort out the pieces the same way if im rebuilding a model y this set packs a lot of functionality into a fairly small size but was rather expensive for its size 70 when it was still available compared to other sets of that time you can also rig up the technic flag sticker that it comes with to the main model ive done that on mine you may want to reinforce it with tape if youre going to leave the model on display though as it will break up over time due to uv exposure like many stickers do i had to do that with mine after it started to crack although it still looks pretty good	positive
the only original stickers are the front headlightpatterns on the 2 red 1x2 bricks the others have been destroyed  must have been the bad decaying sticker quality that breaks when youll remove it  so i printed them i didnt print the flag for only the alternate model needs it although its a neat idea and lordgalewind clickey i keep that in mind one of my 8880 is already dusty enough	negative
hmm seems like the wheels are recycled into the harley truck in the 2008 batman set	neutral
natelite on mar 10 2008 0557 pm said hmm seems like the wheels are recycled into the harley truck in the 2008 batman set nope the harleytruckwheels are thinner and somewhat more modern i do believe theyre the same like in 8274 aaaaaaaand for a long time in my life these wheels have been the best and coolest looking ive ever had so wheres your deference d recycled  xd	positive
ive seen a few cases like this where the box pictures are slightly different from the actual model the airtech claw rig compressor is another one that comes to mind the changes sometimes seem pointless and make you wonder why they bothered p quote the only original stickers are the front headlightpatterns on the 2 red 1x2 bricks the others have been destroyed  must have been the bad decaying sticker quality that breaks when youll remove it  so i printed them i didnt print the flag for only the alternate model needs it although its a neat idea the other stickers on mine have held up pretty well although i didnt try to remove them after i put them on the flag started to break after a year or so and just fell off its axle at one point i taped over it and its holding up well now although its a little frayed along one edge this is actually the earliest set ive seen that uses this crappy sticker material which is unfortunately very common today even other technic sets had good stickers for many years after that	negative
bernddasbrot on mar 10 2008 0556 pm said youve just motivated me to go on a senselesspreliminarydesignerrorshunt man this set is a disaster what were they thinking d p i just remembered one other fun aspect of this set the crane hook can be attached to the underside of the rear bumper to hold it in position while driving along but when things are like this and you try and wind up the cable the winch is strong enough to break the original provided lego rope it worked with my copy d so this set is capable of demolishing itself but still one of the best technicsets i have with all stickers intact im not so sure about that flag though must check on that	positive
wow that first picture is great you must have a very wide angle lens with the capability to focus very close macro the perspective makes the model look huge nice work i think the suspension on this set is my favorite of all technic it has such large travel and is so what word should i use bouncy hey why do you only review sets which are red d eric	positive
blakbird on mar 10 2008 0935 pm said hey why do you only review sets which are red d i exactly thought that today as i made the pics for my signature xd at my school leaving examination i made a model in blender3d and explained to the board of examiners how to build a car and how to animate it it needed a color so i took red because all beautiful and fast cars are red my physics teacher contradicted 	neutral

reread your review today great pictures this is a fabulous model got this model a few months ago for just € 25 it is small and has great working parts i love the way the frontsuspension is made epic i only had the lightstickers replaced with transclear bricks btw the gear rack has been used in this years 8048 buggy	positive
i also happened to receive this set this weekend virtually misb the seals on the side of the box were loose however everything inside was untouched this little beast a joy to build and even more so to play with as indicated by eric on the technicopedia page its crammed with functions for a mediumsized set i think i love it even more than my son does	positive
grepin on mar 24 2010 1237 am said  the only flaw i noticed was weak support of the rear drivetrain which was easily corrected with a few extra plates huh like where dont have that much problems with that rear train at least if i you dont trow the model down the stairs or something like that	neutral
junkstylegio on mar 23 2010 1117 pm said huh like where dont have that much problems with that rear train at least if i you dont trow the model down the stairs or something like that maybe its unusual but this section of the drive train didnt hold that well on my model this is how it looks now the parts made redundant were left in the built model thats why theres that useless 8tooth gear there p	neutral
hello my dear friends heres something new i am actually making a review with pictures yes i got a new camera for christmas now i was testing to see how the camera would reflect so some of the pics are a bit blurry i have based this review from dunamiss reviews he is my inspirationso without further ado i bring you the review set  7693 name etx alien strike price 1999 1299 pieces 246 box okay so as you can see below the box is pretty simple as always european versions wont have the piece count name etc just the number i believe mine having the american version has the info on it as you can see it has the classic mm logo and the red planet as well as the set in a pose itself very nice i linked it because the pic wasnt resizing httpwwwbrickshelkedscn0017jpg below is the back of the box it shows the other sets and some features of this set contents next we have the contents this set includes a medium sized dss xwingyoda a bag labeled one and huge bag labeled two the 1 bag contains a smaller bag and the two bag includes two smaller bags 5 bags in all also pictured are the instructions i have linked it due to the nonresize httpwwwbrickshelkedscn0019jpg figs included in this set are three figs two jellies and 1 astro the jeelies are fine but i pefer the lom ones but they glow those new alien commanders for summer look promising though the astro is nice and includes an extra gold visor moc on astro miner in all mm sets there is a human and alien set the astro par of this set is a miniminer here is a pic of construction and that wonderful space logo sticker not much of a cockpit  finished minerthe set number too overall i like the miner and it is nicely designed i feel the cockpit is lacking though aliens the alien vehical is the main part of the set this pic shows the beginning steps solid and sturdy but those four axlespin partsblue are pointless no support and they dont get used at all nice tlc  now we get cooking this pic shows the tail added on and the more bulk being built we get a little repetitive and build the craft up in this pic and this pic from the instructions shows how the alien craft transforms for battle the completed set and extra bits parts 810 figs 810 price per piece ration 910 playability 910 overall 85 the alien craft is great the attack feature is nice and there are a ton of trans green parts the alien falls out of the cockpit when turned upside down i love this set and its perfect for mm fans or beginnersit has nice parts and read the above part for more details gallery when moderated keep an eye out for future reviews please comment 	positive
thanx for the review i have one question do these aliens have moving arms as far as the set goes i think lego did a bad job on the alien ship i dont think any of the alien ships look good in mars mission the human fanction got a lot better this year and i would have bought this buggy if it came by its self	negative

thank you for your nice review vbbn y but it only confirms this theme is not my cup of tea weird aliens strange colors parts stuck together with no idea  i always hated this big wheels  its even worse in orange x saving money for different sets on and that doesnt mean it was a bad review  	neutral

well as bad a concept aliensvshumans is for a theme i really do like this set the human rover has nice parts for reuse especially those oldschool space wheels and despite those wobbly wings i really like the alien ship goes from a flying saucerish shape to a spread winged almost raven shape very ominous and cool looking now that alien commander is terrible if i dont buy bionicle minifigs already why would i be interested in that thing kinda wish theyd take the drones from the retiring exoforce theme and do them in green theyd make nice alien robot things	positive
a great review for a great set sweet i too own it and its still in one piece  kliq on mar 13 2008 0520 am said the only negative for me is the cockpit of the mining unit not really because it isnt detailed but because mine is top heavy and keeps falling forward its kinda funny if you think about him driving along and then falling forwardbut not funny at all when youre playing  may i suggest this mod httpwwwbrickshelycgii2848762	positive

that looks like a very nice set  in your opinion how does it compare to the current dune buggy toa of justice	positive
i dont own the 8296 but what i can see from the pictures i would say that 8296 is very similar to 8829 the only things that are different ist that 8296 is studless and features a steering wheel for the seat but 8829 has got bigger wheels  it also would have been nice if the wheels from 8296 could have the same tread	neutral
toaofjustice on mar 21 2008 0810 am said that looks like a very nice set  in your opinion how does it compare to the current dune buggy toa of justice imho 8829 is much better than 8296 first 8829 is a lot bigger i really like the huge rear balloon tires they both have rack and pinion steering and they both have trailing arm rear suspension with a v2 engine i think the body on 8829 is a little more well done for 8296 i think the alternate tractor model is much better for more comparisons see technicopedia eric	positive
blakbird on mar 22 2008 0949 pm said one thing i noticed is that a bunch of your pictures are missing the beam that goes over the left hand wheel as a fender oh no i forgot to put it back i wanted to make a photo with this beam alone 8 blakbird said what kind of camera do you use the pictures have very good depth of field meaning that both the foreground and the background are in good focus this is usually hard to do without a very small aperture the camera belongs to my dad its a panasonic lumix dmcfz30eg blakbird said one of them works well mated with an 8 tooth on parallel axles and the other one doesnt the difference is only supposed to be longer teeth so it really should not matter but it does if your set works bad try switching the crown gear to one of the other variety worked for me wow youre right never thought of that thanks i made a scan  of those two gears you can notice the longer teeth first pic edited by bernddasbrot 23 march 2008  0303 pm	neutral

when i went to blue water they have dogs in the pick a brick wall so i have plenty  yes i think i have everything here thats why i havent baught this the fireman or the construction worker they need to bring out something unique	negative
a very neat and useful little set thank you for the nice review sweet	positive
thanks for the review it looks beautiful my father was a backhoe driver so understandably i used to drool over this set in the catalogs i never did get it though as lego was so expensive in australia then i had around 2000 pieces and i thought i had loads d anyway last year i bought 8455 which i love it works great with a compressor i made too sweet i wish mine had a real cab though  do you have 8455 as well id love to see how they compare side by side it looks bigger than 8455 but i dont own any of the big old chuncky tires so i find it so hard to tell by the way i have been reading all of your reviews but i have been a bit busy of late so i havent had time to comment i hope you have more planned any chance of a supercar one	positive
a great review for a great set it even had the old technic tpieces and bevels which i actually prefer to their modern counterparts cp5670 on mar 24 2008 0814 am said the turntable on the back doesnt turn very well though as the weight is all distributed on one side the screw axle prevents it from popping off but there is still a lot of friction in it i got mine for £20 in a second hand shop it said complete but one of the screw knuts was missing xo so its practically impossible to keep the back arm on with only one  and theyre rather rare on bl too 	positive
yesterday while building i accidentaly dropped a axle nut of course im working in a total mess and so it tool some time til i found it again there are 324 axle nuts on bricklink with an avg price of 089 i didnt know of this accessoryset 51102 you can buy it for 4000 8	neutral
bernddasbrot on mar 24 2008 0508 pm said there are 324 axle nuts on bricklink with an avg price of 089 but i wants it cheap sing and i would still call 324 quite rare and i also want to just tack it onto another order sad	negative
yeah i meant theyre rare  but i can imagine that a normal axle with the old half bushes will help sometimes these are really strong if you put 23 in a row edit i just tried it a normal 10l axle with 2 interlocking old half bushes type 1 on each end i chose those who only can be moved very hardly along an axle i slewed the bjst  back arm a few times tried the pneumatics parallel to it and it didnt loose edited by bernddasbrot 24 march 2008  0606 pm	neutral

by the way dont forget to build the alternate model of 8862 it is a combine farm equipment which is just as good as 8274 i liked it so much that i bought two copies of this set so i could display both my favorite alternate model not counting universal sets is the 8480 submarine maybe it is time for a white set review skull white is pretty rare for your blue set i recommend you review 8462 there are only a couple of green sets and 8479 is the best and then of course 8458 is silver i think we all know what the best black set is and according to your photography you have lots of them but dont forget 8868 eric	positive
bernddasbrot on mar 24 2008 0539 pm said could you explain your thoughts please you know my english skills  i was thinking you could somehow attach a 16tooth dark gray gear the one that spins freely around axles to the nut which would make the axle move in and out when the gear turned and convert the gears rotary motion to linear motion in a fairly compact package although there are other ways of doing the same thing that dont use such rare parts and the 2008 technic sets will come with prebuilt linear actuators anyway	neutral
bernddasbrot on mar 25 2008 0346 am said 15 seconds wow thats a long exposure i would think you would get way too much light and overexpose the image the aperture must have been tiny quote i will review it too and post it in this topic cool i am also planning to write about the combine on technicopedia combine quote actually i took it from your site xd i thought that word sounded familiar quote unfortunately i dont own 8480 but i think 8824 is also a very good though small white set 8462 rocks as a blue set i just got it a few weeks ago lets see 8462 also is one of the last technic sets i would call oldschool 8479 okay too but 8458 is imho not 8868 and the totally mysteriously black set will follow you dont own 8480 that is unacceptable it is imperative that you put a mortgage on your house immediately to get it sweet yes 8824 is a good white set i also see from your room photos that you have the 8839 supply ship which has lots of white this is a really nice set 8462 is hard to call old school but at least it uses regular beams the air tanks are the best part of the set i wish lego had used them more often especially on the highly pneumatic sets the tank makes all the difference on 8459 you are right 8458 is certainly not old school but it is a great set with wonderful suspension it is of the same era as the super street sensation with all of the panels for body contouring 8868 is technic at its best there is nothing else like it especially with the compressor quote did you had something like this in mind if the toothed 10l axle rotates the axle nuts want to rotate too but they cant because of that 2x4 technic plate so theyll decide to move along the axle the 1x6 bricks on each end make sure that the axle wont move in or out thanks for your feedback while the assembly you have drawn would work as a linear actuator i would not recommend it the torsional stiffness and strength of an axle are proportional to the polar moment of inertia a section property most of the stiffness comes from the outside of the cross shaped axle but in the threaded axle you lose all the stiffness of the outer area because it is not continuous this means you only get stiffness and strength from the small core i think the threaded axle would bend and break very easily if subjected to much torque eric	neutral

as promised and with only a single day of delay is my review of the 2008 set 4994 creator fierce creatures this small set is the same size and price range as last years 4939 cool cars reviewed by prateek and dillthepill the box general info you get 193 pieces vs 206 for cool cars which is quite a lot but most of them are small there are a lot of hinges and some good slopes and wings the building instructions contains three models but no further ideas for inspiration primary model spider the first model is a big spider which shares some similarities to the secondary model of 4895 power in the design the legs each have 3 joints where the ones in the middle have stud joints to be moved sideways while the rest use hinges for all joints there are 8 of them and it does get a little tedious with all the repetitive building in this relatively small model i like the design of the face with a lot of eyes and a big and ugly mouth but the real gem is the xpattern on the opisthosoma made using doubleinverted slopes it is poseable and i think it looks more fierce when inverted secondary model snake the face of the snake is nicely detailed with a splitting tongue and a mouth than can move a little there is a problem with the construction it uses stacked hinges for some of the joints which are hard to pull apart without stressing the pieces tertiary model fly im not completely sure what this insect is i will say its a fly although the tail and head are too pointy this is a neat little thing conclusion primary model 8 it is a good design but lacks some sturdiness in the legs they fall off a little too easily secondary models 6 they are pretty good when you look at the bricks that are available but they dont wow you in any way and they suffer from the same issues as the primary model regarding sturdiness alternate models 3 it is hard to come up with alternate models with so many small pieces and plates that are only 1 stud wide the colors might make you want to build a spyrius space ship playability 8 the models have many movable joints and you can put quite a scare into your minifigs when their town gets attacked by these creatures unless some en forces are there to protect them price 6 creator sets are known for their great price to bricks ratio but this set doesnt quite measure up to sets like cool cars pieces 7 the pieces arent great by themselves but who doesnt need a fist full of hinges slopes and basic plates in standard colors i dont think this is a musthave set like the big rig was last year the pieces are great and it has a nice primary model but the set lacks a bit when it comes to the usual strong creator qualities like alternate models and price brickshelf gallery edited by whitefang 23 may 2009  0630 pm indexed	positive
thanks for this review its a nice set with some cool pieces and nice techniques i like the way the roof pieces are used to make the spiders back for instance lasse d on mar 26 2008 0948 pm said alternate models 3 it is hard to come up with alternate models with so many small pieces and plates that are only 1 stud wide the colors might make you want to build a spyrius space ship ouch thats not a good thing lets refrain from that 	positive

enchanted island 6278 pictorial review original price 66 pieces 412 figures 7 this 1994 set marked the beginning of a new era for lego pirates  it became a theme more centralised around playability and not so much grand ol ships 6278 enchanted island was the flagship set of the islanders subtheme heavily based around polynesian and native american concepts in fact tlc was successfully sued by a number of tribes for using bastardised maori names such as kahuka it was released as a legend set in 2001 but due to poor sales was discontinued again the largest of the islander sets enchanted island is a portion of an island with a river running through the left hand side features some sturdy buildings built into a treelike structure on a rocky outcrop whilst the left hand side features a tower built out of wooden posts and a large tribal statue the box cover shows all the details it does however differ from the instructions finished product in that it has been more aesthetically arranged  bushes etc have been moved to fill in gaps and to not obscure other things the sides of the box show nothing particularly special although in one scene it depicts the islander canoe chasing the pirate boat with the treasure just one way to play with the set the back of the box however is superb featuring a large number of alternative models a toothy statue a pirate tree think wolfpack with an islander base kahukas throne a firebreathing statue and a soupedup boat for the pirates these and many more can be easily made because of the large diversity of pieces the set has a huge number of minifigures for its size the third highest number in the pirate range the ses and the bsb being first and second respectively  a whopping 7 5 islanders including the alltoocommon king kahuka the elusive islander babe and 3 standard warriors  this set alone will never leave you short of enemies 2 pirates ironhook in his standard attire with a scurvy dog at his side attack the island although they are only moderately armed  2 cutlasses and a pistol between them a musket wouldve been nice the islanders on the other hand have 4 shields a bow and quiver and 6 spears not to mention the big pokey thing with horns on top weapon idol staff a monkey parrot and crocodile provide the obvious creature features with a fair amount of gold to finish off in the instructions the goblet does not have the lid although it does on the box its a nice touch anyway  adding a little more diversity to the monotonous treasure stashes the pirates boat is a nice 2 sail vessel with oars for when the wind stops and a treasure map the sails are similar to those in lagoon lockup but with an extra front sail its an awesome little boat better for raids than a rowing boat but not too big that it cant sail up rivers it can comfortably fit 2 men and at a squeeze 5 the sails are expensive if you buy them seperately normally this wont be a problem but they can cost aroun 5 each the islanders boat is a canoe with a sail and an outrigger to stabilise it the sail is beautifully done with 2 spars taughtening it there is a clip for the rower to leave his weapon when at se and the mast can turn to get as much wind as possible its quite a topheavy boat but it doesnt look hideous and without the mastsail it looks great 3 islanders can fit in it and more if they sit on the outrigger the markings on the canoe are stickers but they look fine and are probably more robust than markings for their job furthermore theyre waterproof sing kahukas throne can be carried by 2 loyal subjects or strapped to his pet crocodile the clips on the side can be used to rest his weaponry or hold spears for battle the throne looks nice although im not too sure about the blue against the red  id have prefered white as it would clash less an overview of the island it is built in 2 halves  left then right and then joined together loosley so it can be seperated for transporting around the back to the left and right there are large open spaces that are great for battles  this set isnt so much about a large solid build but creating a village  smaller structures linked by bridges and the back to the far left is a platform built onto the rock with access from the river via a ladder theres the standard islander drum with the lovely zebraskin part where did they get that ive never understood the white flag  i was under the impression it was used for surrender further along the rocky bank there are some hinged palm leaves that swing upwards to reveal the treasure its an ok hiding place not the best place to hide it right where the pirates sail past but it feels fabulous it fits right in above it on the rocky bank is the main structure it looks very disjointed when you build it bricks all over the place but once its done it looks nice and rural with leaves everywhere and the balcony where kahuka is standing you get a nice roof made from 2 large palm leaves tilting down around the back theres a slight shelter a table for picnics and a ladder to access the upstairs i was rather annoyed that it is so open but the set is designed from just one perspective to the left is the bridge to the other building a nice one piece bridge made of the softer plastic used for muskets and the post1991 cutlasses it looks good but be warned it tilts when you pull a pin sending the pirates flying this contraption is a good idea but it is very stiff and so doesnt swing even when burdened by a minifigure  youll want to modify this bit if you get it the other building looks like it is made out of posts and beams they are all red brown would have been better but it would have added too many colours to the range just like the use of black for trees in some forestmen sets there are 3 clips for spare weapons only 2 of these will ever be used when all the islanders are armed but it gives the pirates scope once theyve been disarmedtheres another nice palm tree roof on top 2 ladders give accesstheres a total of 4 in this set  worth getting eh although theyre 5p on bricklink for a kabob theyre like gold at the top theres another hidey hole the palm leaves lift up on hinges to show the treasure or hiding islander it can be seen from behind but this set is designed from one perspective only nice cattlehorns tooalongside the slats you can see in the floor  5 years later and it wouldve been a solid plate the big statue is one of the main selling point of this set alongside the tilting bridge  theyre the action features shown in every catalogue at the time but it is not really special just original the statue fits in with the theme perfectly  kahukas mask his shield and this statue all depict the same deity which is a nice collectible idea the back is rather plain except the angled 1x1 bricks  a good touch im not sure why theres a black brick in the back of the head but this is easily remedied it could even be done with a brick from this same set just swapping the two over aside from the head turning the back can open to store sacred objects or in my opinion prisoners hence the gaps for breathing either way its a lovely piece of architecture and deservedly a flagship element of the set theres your standard cooking pot floating around although a 1x1 yellow stud as human flesh remember minifigs are yellow no matter what the licensed themes say is a superb finish this set is a stunning set for both kids and afols who are just getting back into legopirates  it is a great army builder and due to its release as a legend is extremely cheap on ebay  you should be able to pick one up for £18 or £15 if youre lucky for that you get a lifetimes supply of islanders 4 ladders some wall panels 2 baseplates one raised and both with rivers and printed vegetation around the edge a ton of weapons a fair quantity of standard bricks but most of all a heap of vegetation this is an easy to buy set with normally around 5 on ebay at any time and is well worth it for the parts the play and the nostalgia it can be easily modified when used in conjunction with any other outpost a much larger fortress can be made especially if more rope bridges are used if you pick 2 of this fine set off ebay itll still be less than the original price a huge complex can be constructed giving you an instantaneous village for around £35 other information lugnet rating

excellent review y getting a better chance to look at this set actually makes me interested in it i was in my dark ages throughout the islander days though i have built up a small force of them 10 from ebay buys but no actual sets if this is really as reasonable as you say there i may just have to pick one up soon oddly i do own the baseplates to this set having also picked them up in a lot on ebay so i might be able to recreate it manually but i think id rather pick one up whole it looks like a great mix of parts and makes a decent looking display piece thanks again for the fine review y	positive
a great and informative review with very fine pictures thanks slyowl sweet a wonderful set this is indeed full of nice details and pretty playable and a cool subtheme that offers a lot of fantasy and charming characters in a marvelous layout i really love that little boat with the outrigger and the neat buildings and sweet landscaping works together very well tlc got sued for using some names of native sounding origin now that sounds really strange to me such names´re widely spread within novels movies and such stuff i didn´t know that there´s some kind of copyright on them 8	positive
good review mr slyowl and good pics too i know it probably deserves better but i only give him a 3 ill be surely the only saying that i dont like this set but i remember i had it for christmas when i was a child and it disappointed me very much because i expected it much larger after seeing it in the lego catalogs well its just a little trauma i had p lol anyway i must admit its an interesant set specially because of the large number of minifigures and accesories it brings with and the two little ships edited by bluebard 31 march 2008  0113 am	positive

its a great set and one i have yet to add to my collection despite my large number of islander extras enchanted island aside from having so alluring a name was good value for money in that you only needed this one set and you had a good representation of the islanders both in the size of the set and the number of minifigs the flipping rope bridge and the river give it a great rainforest retreat sort of feeling and one is inclined to think of this set as more inland than directly coastal for me whilst the islanders were never seen in the same light or popularity as pirates and imperials they were an obvious and colourful addition that to me added a whole new depth to the pirate system and one was now able to play a 3 or 4 way war adding a greater political element to the sets enchanted island is probably the 3rd most appealing of the large land bases for me after port royal and eldorado fortress good review and glad to see the set recognised	positive
slyowl youre a legend thank you for taking the time to do such a comprehensive review youve captured enchanted island in impeccable detail and anyone who doesnt own this set should know it insideout by now i shall write my thoughts on the set itself directly	positive
wow that is one great review you made sly i gave it a four only thing i dont like is the raised baseplate it does get you a lot of figs two ships and some nice assecories great set	positive
great review i think this set looks great i really like the islanders and that statue is really nice it comes with a lot of nice leaves and i like all of the secret compartments and the like thanks for the nice review	positive
i was just going into my dark ages when lego began the islander themes so ive never really cared for them but this review actually made me want this set real bad i guess this is what reviews are for then  good job on the review	positive
everytime i saw this at a toy store i always cried to my parents for one but never got it i got the smaller islander sets but the more i see this now i dont want it i could buy it but naahh i am hoping lego does an updated version of the islanders with this new pirates line one can hope right xd	neutral
hello eldiano although the review is fine and you have memories related to that set please have in mind that the post you were replying to was in fact some 7 years old this is what we call bumping of old topics and it shouldnt be done you might want to take a look at our faq posting tips and etiquette edited by phred 06 april 2015  0347 am by phred read next post please	neutral
eldiano thank you for posting about your desire to have this set i do own the set and i do recommend it to others if they somehow find a used one the bricks are kind of sparse but the the bricks it does come with are really nice i love the figs and the base plates are by far my favorite made by tlg captain braunsfeld i suggest that you read through the link that covers topic bumping more clearly i apologize for the confusion eldiano i do believe that i have found a way to remove the confusion of posting in old topics soon among the pirate staff and to the other members of eb please stay tuned sinner on 18 july 2010  0316 am said 3 lego reviews dont date thus if you have something relevant to say then feel free to post in a topic but if its more than a few months old please make sure its good and if its been a few years it better be really good for example if you liked the review or set and want to say so you probably shouldnt if youve got an answer to a question such as does anyone have pictures of the alternate model then by all means post what you shouldnt do is ask questions to the original poster heshe may not even visit eb any more	positive
i realized that building the chess set from the new pirates theme they are two grey heads that reminded me of the king kahuna throne which goes to say that i am hoping they bring back new sets i just wish they were bigger i would love to build the old ones but i would side more towards the newer model if they ever released them	negative
what an amazing old set i loved pirates in my childhood but that was before the islander and spanish stuff mine were the bsb and soldier fortress with the big baseplate as im now returning to pirates ive tracked down most of the 2009 sets and of course bought the new 2015 sets but knowing i missed this middle period of islanders vs pirates makes me a bit sad those islanders are soooo monkey island those of my age likely feel the same to my eyes oh for a lemonhead minfig  im curious now how much this set sells for given it was apparently one of very few lego actually rereleased i recently bought a misb bsb that was an early 2000s rerelease and it was very pricey but then i suspect the bsb has a lot more of a nostalgic following these days than this set can anyone give me a rough idea what this set goes for in asnew condition these days regardless a fantastic review with some great photos of the whole set and minifigs even though this is an old thread i am glad someone else bumped it recently so i can add my thoughts too  one thing ive noticed comparing the newest pirates sets to the 80s ones i had as a kid and these from the 90s is the move away from baseplates and big panel pieces i actually like that in a lot of ways whilst i miss baseplates being included as they are a great starting point for creating new things and make the sets easier to play with visually i think legodesigned model sets look better without them	positive

sorry to bump such an old thread but i´ve just discovered this set is on sale at amazonde  for a mere 25 euros i am tempted not because i like the set or the models but because of the parts as most of you might know i´m especially into exoforce so would you recommend to get this set just for the parts are they a good choice to combine with efsets would anyone of you be interested in obtaining the fleshieparts of the minifigs from me as i totally don´t need those	neutral
well thanks for your posting but i couldn´t care less about fleshie minifigs or movieaccurate cars  or the cars at all this set would really only go into my parts bin therefore i need to know what parts are in there and if they are cool enough to go into an exoforce collectors parts bin	neutral

hi ive promised a lot lately ill review 8868 8880 space police ii blacktron ii and i will its just the time that is blocking me and my university and the fact that i just picked up 8460 in original box for only eur 3650 sweet the other reviews will follow  please bear with me and this set review is also a gift to this nice fellow who gave me the title thats what im talking about 1 useless information with high numbers this set contains 841 parts and was released in 1995 in the technic  tech build  advanced sub theme the bricklink price guide displays for “used” a qty avg price of 12585 and for “new” a qty avg price of 21282 i got it for 5698 still can’t believe it  this set was rereleased two times 8431 in 2002 and 8438 in 2003 2 the box front back open the box is higher than other technic boxes why i don’t know 8460 doesn’t have any real large parts whatever inlay i wonder why tlg doesn’t make inlays anymore… they’re noisy and brake easily but are great for pre sorting 3 building instructions i will quote myself from the 8862 review quote wow these instructions are used im not used to this after all this sets with unread instruction booklets triplewow ‘nuff said this is the “first” page fortunately peeron offers scans the last step for the alternate model and a few nice photos showing how the pneumatic pump will be erm pumped yeah random page i forgot the overall thoughts to the instructions these are technic instructions as we’re used to them part count easy to understand okay the string part at the end was too much for me and the color distinction is okay too 100 pages long and if i can trust my eyes the pneumatics page can be fold out i don’t have this page but i assume it 4 the parts 5 building an easy and fun build okay this could take some time my longest building review up to date the front steering the rear steering the axle pin between the rear steering is for the axle which rotates the crane the two worm screws in the front are for the outriggers they’re not linked one for each side the small wheel in the back is for the rotation adjusting front and rear steering outriggers are finished you can notice a 8 tooth gear that will rotate the technic turntable a steering wheel has been added could be the same stickers like the alternate 8880 used to have the steering can be operated with both actinic lights  no we’re far from finished i’ve got a lot of parts left at this point wow a 4x4 corner plate pneumatics and a winch if you can’t recognize it on the photo the technic beams are the erm wrongother side up the 1x6 technic beams on the left side are normal the axle that will extend the crane 7 gear racks 1x4 the 1x6 technic plate will keep the two pneumatic cylinders straight sad 8 huh did you blink you missed a special part the whole rotatable thing will be attached to the technic turntable using two long technic pins the pin on the right side should be in the middle of the three “turntable holes” on the right side it’s the first hole asymmetric why because we’ll add a cute cab 6 functionality you can find the features in comparison to other technic cranes here technopedia of course i made one sentence out of it please don’t find any mistakes p “two axle rack and pinion steering pneumatic luffing and gear driven telescoping via crank for the boom which can slew 360° on turntable driven via gear crank driven hoist and gear driven outriggers at four corners which snap over center” 7 random shots comparison to 8854 uuuh… once again a depth of field i tried to make it look authoritarian like 8858 but i failed somehow 8460 looks cute 8 comparison to 8421 mobile crane  crane truck i feel that a question concerning this will be asked so i deal with it right now first of all i don’t own 8421 yet i know a technic freak really should own it anyway 8421 has more than twice as much parts as 8460 is motorized features a v6engine and a very neat mechanism to extend the craneboom twice using a braided string with end studs try to find out how of course 8421 features far more than 8460 imho 8421 should have been a copy of 8460 a set so successful that it has been rereleased two times but the designers overshoot the mark 8421 is a breathtaking monster compared to it 8460 looks cute  not pale 9 final thoughts i got it on ebay in kind of good condition for about 50 dollars i know that it has been worth the money in any point of view wub i didn’t use the word “oldschool” for now i’ll change that 8460 belongs to the favored few of oldschool technic sets thanks for reading and viewing the pictures i hope you enjoyed it please comment if you want to	positive
im in the same situation as you i have this set but missed out on the newer 8421 this was a great set for its time but the 8421 definitely looks better to me ive been trying to find a good deal on it on ebay but its pretty expensive considering that it only went out of production last year quote inlay i wonder why tlg doesn’t make inlays anymore… they’re noisy and brake easily but are great for pre sorting the box designs in general are crappier these days than they used to be 10 years ago you dont see the old featured parts trays anymore and the boxes dont have the different sections either these also acted as internal supports for larger boxes so they were less prone to being crushed the cardboard material is also quite a bit thinner i think its a result of tlcs overall costcutting moves since then most people toss the boxes and probably dont care but i keep all of them there was actually a time when the boxes used to be even stronger i have an old 8859 set and the outer box is made of a hard styrofoam material although they probably stopped using that for environmental reasons edited by cp5670 06 april 2008  1013 pm	neutral

simonwillems on apr 7 2008 1201 am said somehow i competely missed your review when you first made it i saw your pics on brickshelf and wondered about the review you have managed to review my all time favourite technic set yeah somehow i wonderd why only vbbn thanks responded but i learned from yodas sig patience  for a jedi it is time to eat as well  eat eat  hot  good food  d simonwillems said it was the first large technic set i was given by my parents when it first came out in 1995 i played for hours with this set making minifig seats in it it was so huge there was room for four minifigs to sit next to eachother in front i made various applications for it a bungeejump system with a large rubber band and lots of containers to be lifted the first changes i made included the inverting of the wheels and the disabling of one of the flashlightsteering wheels because they obstructed eachother by the way the nob for your winch is yellow instead of black i know this set by heart so watch out p  i always liked those nobs and people think you cant play  moc with technic at all xd about the nob erm yeah i only found 3 black ones in the box and so i took the yellow one that i got as an extra with 8829 simonwillems said the alternate model was great fun too the pump is cleverly hidden and the crane folds up great between the cab and the loading platform you could easily mod it with a pneumatic claw on the crane a motor to turn it and a compressor the only flaw was the loading platform which had no floor only some axles another reason for the 8460 as favorite set its got a real alternate model not just a different erm crane simonwillems said thanks so much for reviving my memorie concerning this great set youre welcome i consider this as my job  cp5670 said but i keep all of them there was actually a time when the boxes used to be even stronger i have an old 8859 set and the outer box is made of a hard styrofoam material although they probably stopped using that for environmental reasons thats the spirit i got more than hundred boxes and my 8848 box came with styrofoam too	positive
great review while i admit i wasnt into technic at the time this came out i was a mere child give me a break d i can see now why it was featured so much from the booklets to display stands at toy stores and at my local lego center when it was still around this thing was everywhere with your review i can now truly appreciate all the details of the set i got to admit i can see the appeal now that comparison shot you took is amazing i love not only just how it included the little details such as the stabilizers but also looks incredibly fun to play around with great set and an even greater review	positive

a very fine review of a really great set thanks alex this set has everything a croc very nice mfs a neat tree trap a cool zodiac and a marvelous and very detailed amphibious car in a beautiful color scheme the only thing i´m not colpletely sure is the design of that jerrycan thanks for the right word and the interesting link kingboy  although the use of the revolver´s pretty clever indeed and fits well too it´s still clearly well a revolver very unusual and interesting for an official tlc design	positive
this set looks good about the jerry cans i like how they give me more pistols this may be the only indy set i get from this batch ill just have to deal with the fleshie heads exchange them for yellow like stealth hunter said this will be good for army building silent help	positive

set ref 7626 name jungle cutter number of minifigs 4 number of pieces unknown price 3999€ a general view of the set we’ve got 5 giant ants two russian soldiers a general indy of course 3 trees a small entrance of a cave and the debroussaillor vehicle i don’t know the english name of it… you can’t enter into the cave because there is a spider web with its spider…unless… unless you know how the mechanism works and the spider web go up… and reveals a case with diamonds and accessories a closer view on the mechanism which is simple but works well and you can also see the difference or maybe the same size of a spider and a giant ant and i’ve always thought that those spiders were very big compared to the minifigs so those ants are really giant poor small frog the three trees with the entrance make a nice jungle layout don’t speak too loud you will wake up the soldier… don’t worry for him he will be waken up by the vehicle before being eaten by those giant ants a front view making the vehicle really menacing a back view push the red part from the back and there are two parts that fall down from the vehicle i don’t know why… the movie will clarify this i think… and here you can see how the two big circular blades turn when you push the vehicle… simple but effective run indy run this set is really nice the playability of the different elements is great the colour scheme is nice too i like those dark green tree parts the vehicle is really impressive without being too big and its very well details in general the designers of the indy sets have made a really nice works with a lot of efforts in all those details everywhere i’ve got some project for this set to integrate it in my city i’m a city mocer and not an indy fan so i don’t have bought the temple the bigger set of the series because it has nothing special for me in term of part selections or in the design in relation with the town theme and because my supermarket doesn’t have it yet so we are waiting for a member to review it and make the part 4…	positive

this one is my favorite from the bunch thanks for the time spent in making a review	positive
thanks for the review alex i agree that this is the best set of kotcs sets although the airplane comes quite close although im not too fond of the trees the cave is good and the jungle cutter is brilliant plenty of great features and very detailed with much of the engine showing and a decent cockpit if thats the right word the general and the two soviets are great too could we have a closeup pic of them please  good to see that neither torso has exposed fleshy skin like the nazis as said though it is quite a pricy set i was expecting it to be just over the price of race for the stolen treasure great set thanks again alex	positive

ahhhhh now this swamp vehicle looks great to me when i first heard lego were making it i was worried that it would be a poor version however im pleased to see that its not even though im not a great fan of those treads the trees dont really add anything to the set which is a shame still the parts are welcome at least the entrance is good though it could do with being bigger but i guess we can moc that i really like the commie general he looks like a real bad megablocks	positive
great review again alex  same question in case you didnt se it in my reply to the other set where did you get those new sets  i really love that set  its called jungle cutter the trees are really cool and make a great adition to it imo that temple entrance or monument is really cool  those bionicle parts do make fantastic vegetation  i totally forgot about that green frog  thats cool  those are so cute  5 more ants is great  the vehicle look really sharp ah ah ah 2 more commies yeay  that officer is really freaky actually  could have been a high rank under pol pots regime in the s21 yeay looks more asian than russian imo now its time for my grips  same bloody rant about indy   i havent read the instructions before but once again there are so many parts in crap colours that need to be changed look at all the crap red and yellow in there  i will need to look for those parts before buying the set like i always do  mod while building on  i am really soimpressed with that indy line  i sincerely hope it will have a long and healthy life 	positive

great classic dragon den i love the old green dragons very much there were my fave i love these theme very much after the black knights era this is a very very good set i wished i can have this too	positive
a very neat set with charming mfs and a great classic dragon a good use of burps and a really nice tree indeed thanks for the review agentrick57	positive
this was the last castle set i got before my dark age really liked it although the big rock parts looked really bad  i am kind of used to them now unfortunately i lost the little wand and i never understood who is good and who is bad does the wizard own the dragon well they dont seem to be enemies but isnt the dragon supposed to be evil	positive
the wizard somehow controls the dragons i think like for example the wizard of the new castle line does with the undead skeletons but i think it isnt sure that the dragon masters wizard is evil as it is still unclear which factions of the older castle series are good or bad	neutral

the 8291 dirt bike comes from a long line of technic bikes and i think its the best ever it looks great and its fun to ride around in the house i hoped to find a figure the right size for it but none of mine would fit unlike a lot of technic models it looks good from all angles considering the size of the model it has a complicated way of connecting the engine to the wheel the rear shocks are just the right stiffness and they have a good amount of travel i thought these shocks were new i need to get out more functions shocks two front one stiffer one in the rear drivetrain 2 piston engine linked to the rear wheel via gears and a chainlink steering yes it does stand retractable for the price size and subject what else could be added 1010 parts considering that it has three shocks and a 40 chainlinks its a great set for parts some hard to use large parts are included but they are not overused the usage of the green does limit part usage somewhat though and ill be struggling to find a use for those wheels for anything other than a motorbike 810 price at 3999 aud for 248 parts it isnt the best value set the us price is 2500 which is somewhat better it does have some more complicated parts however 710 looks lego seems to be moving away from the seethough look for technic sets and this is a good example of it im not a big fan of fairings but i think they work great in this set as a fuel tank 810 fudge this set was great for me as i have never had a technic bike however for those that want this for just parts or have other bikes it could be a hard sell the alternate model a chopper is a complete rebuild which i didnt make and its great that lego have been including these most of the time lately 710 overall recommended 810	positive
thanks for the great review sinner i like the technic bikes i wonder how it would look if you replaced the gear on the back wheel with a smaller one	neutral
i have just finished building this set i was a bit disappointed with the amount of bricks when they were out on my table but the final model is really nice and totally makes up for that i like the small details like on the handles and fuel tank and the only real negative thing i can say is that the cog seems a bit oversized in the rear i dont know if the designer frequents this forum but im sure he will be happy about how much you like it  it took quite some timeprototypes to get to this design sorry about the size of the picture  it isnt mine	positive
hinckley on apr 23 2008 0110 am said it must be cold in that room nice shirt but the vertical hold is broken its a meeting room in billund  the temperature is usually fine there according to my memory i must say thats a nice collection of motocross bikes the employe is displaying building technic is such a specialist dicipline i think it takes a lot of patience to finalize the design of a model even such a relative simpel one as this cute bike front	neutral
how did i manage to miss this review i must have overlooked it somehow thanks for making this one sinner its always nice to see reviews of technic sets im not so sure whether i like this set i am not that much into motorbikes but lego did a good job on this one it looks a lot like an upgraded version of one of the first bikes lego made namely the 8838 shock cycle i also believe the back gearwheel is somewhat oversized it looks better with the smaller one you attached it is good to see that lego is back to making the technic sets the way they were except for the green that is 	neutral

i wasnt very interested in this set at first it seemed to be just a nice looking truck with a small motor but when i found out it had a transmission i changed my mind here is the transmission it allows the single motor to be used for two functions this system has been around for a while and lego seem to be using it more and more the transmission driving ring alone the red circle goes for 515 usd on bricklink and you also need the catch and clutch gear so i have been buying sets that have them instead i now have enough parts to make a supercar gearbox i bet a new supercar comes out next year now this is the gear that rotates the arm note the colour of the 24 tooth gear it seems to be a new gear trend a lot of work has been put into this truck looking real personally i think they went too far as the truck seems to have been designed for a tilting cab but its disabled to prevent breaking the front bottom of the transmission the bottom shaft lifts the arm note that there are more dark grey gears the motor fits in very well also the bottom of the arm i was surprised by the usage of a 12 tooth bevel to link with the 36 tooth double bevel as i had never seen that done before as you can see there is no room for any drive train standard steering for a recent technic truck there is a handofgod at the cab top that links via two knob wheels it looks good from the back you can also see the white clutch that connects the transmission to the motor to avoid burnouts it goes decently high and can go a bit higher if you use the crane arm compared to last years fire truck if i didnt buy the fire truck for half price i would have been annoyed that lego brought out what is almost a motorised version of the same set functions cherry picker arm motorised rotate and lift that links to a motor via a transmission and antiburnout clutch steering rack and pinion controlled via a handofgod linked by knob wheels doors open and close good functionality that works well but i wish they made the cab lift and im a bit sick of the lame fairing door trick 710 parts motor battery box transmission clutch practical wheels only two fairings compact turntable this is a great parts set 1010 price at 9999 aud for 726 parts its ok value when you consider what you are getting the us price is 6000 which is better but still not great i bought mine for 80 aud which was good however and i suspect that the price is designed for easy sale810 looks id buy this for the looks alone 910 fudge the functions work well and i llked it more than i thought i would oddly mine seemed to be missing a axle pin with friction but since it includes extra parts for the alternate model i didnt mind using one of my spares on the subject of the alternate model it is a dump truck which is made out to be a total rebuild but it isnt it could have easily been done like super street sensation was but lego have probably determined that instructions like that confuse people 810 overall recommended 810	positive
thank you for that fine review of a pretty cool and nice set with a very good amount of functionality and um playability for sure	positive
thanks for the review i bought this set when it first came out and it is still in the box it is stuck in my fairly lengthly backlog but after seeing your review ill have to put it to the top of the queue	neutral
thank you for your detailed review sinner i´m not that much into technic building because i´m lacking the inspiration to build something different with all those technic elements so i´ll pass on this one and stay to classic bricks	neutral
thanks for the review i think i am going to get this set for its many technic pieces i could really use those for a rig im going to build	neutral
looks like an interesting set i didnt realize the motor controlled two functions through a transmission switch thats always good to see ill probably pass it up though until the price falls a bit the overall design is a bit too studless for my liking i think the 8275 bulldozer has a much better balance of studded and studless pieces and the wheels somehow look too small to me i also have something of a backlog at the moment i still need to pick up that bulldozer along with the 8421 mobile crane on ebay	neutral
wow its a smarty set with drive shafts we are everybody and technical junk the specs and stuff kind of lose me but the walrus looks really cute in the cherry picker i imagine hes saving a kitten but really this is a great review and has a wealth of detail and knowlege for techniphiles thanks for providing such a cool resource for eb i really did enjoy delving in to the world of technic for a few moments the walrus rides it  oh hes so smart	neutral

set 7627  indiana jones  temple of the crystal skull pieces 929 price aud14999 out of all the indy 4 sets this one seems to cop the most flak  which may account for the fact that the other 3 were reviewed weeks ago and this one has sat unloved and alone waiting for someone to turn their eye upon it or yknow buy it luckily im a sucker for spooky old temples filled with devilish traps and hidden treasures hissing fountains and overgrown foliage creepy skeletons and crumbling stonework so here it is indiana jones 7627 temple of the crystal skull part 1 the figs first off the figs  6 humans and 4 skellies or should that be skullies  indy mutt irina and that sneery russian guy thats in the 2 smaller sets nothing new here aha what have we here  two natives i wonder if hair is a sign of power in this culture since one guy is completely bald and the other one has the most extraordinarily luxurious black mullet somehow i doubt the movie will answer this question back view  as you can see the scalp tattoos are also popular in this tribe fashion conscious note in the background the paws of the fearsome black jungle panther ie my cat curious as to see what the tribe was up to also dont ask me why these guys are carrying axes rather than say spears and what everyones been waiting for the skullies  three of em and a conquistador skellie  very cute note the backs of the crystal head have a plumesized hole  or maybe thats just where they injected the blue brainplastic spooky i love these skulls i wasnt sold from the initial pics but they have a very creepy smile and the head shape is just weird with the large eyes its kind of homer simpsonesque and here we have the token vehicle in the set  a weird little tank thing with treads kind of looks like a cross between the amphibious boat and a minitank im sure theres a military expert around here who can tell us exactly what it is supposed to be the treads are nice but the rest of it is a bit thrown together you can tell they wanted to keep the dark green colour scheme but the budget only allowed them 5 parts to do so  all in all a mixed bag with the figs 4 repeats from the cheaper sets which means we have one new native figure and the crystal skullies there are heaps of the oldskool skele heads scattered around the sets so those that prefer can replace the skullies with ordinary skellies bizarrely the top of the box which has the line of 11 figs pic you know what i mean doesnt have names for any of the characters whereas all the smaller sets do part 2 box parts front of box back of box two instruction books parts this set has come under criticism for being overpriced  myself included  but the official piece count is 900 plus which is pretty good considering it also contains the baseplate 6 big bags and 2 of those 12x12 bricks in dark tan note set does not contain live black jungle panther™ the dss helpfully comes prescrunched thanks to tlc even in a aud150 set they cant get that right sigh the dark tan baseplate say what you like im in love i know some people dont like these but they were such a staple of castle pirates for so many years that i dont consider them a juniorised piece at all this one recycled from the 05 police hq and 06 hospital is much better in design than the king leos castle one as the different heights and asymmetry make it look much more like a natural piece of ground perfect for mocs and its dark tan  how could anyone not love such a huge slab of dark tan note this love doesnt extend to applying the stonework stickers which are frankly crap random instructions page part 3 temple of doom  or just a doomed temple the complete set front view isometricish view back view top view first impressions its very dark tan isnt it and green and bright green and dark green and dark red and normal tan and dark bley and pearl gold in fact its a bit of a mishmash of colours im of two minds about this i kind of prefer the palette to be a bit subtler but i can see that a playset designed for kids isnt going to sell bucketloads all tastefully done in shades of tan with lashings of darkgreen foliage theres a huge amount of dark red in this set which is always a welcome colour but im not convinced it quite works with the 2 shades of tan on offer here on the plus side theres also a huge amount of dark tan in ordinary 2x2 bricks tiles plates and 1x1 and 1x2x3 slopes which is great for anyone wanting to stock up lets take a closer look ill do this roughly in order of the build itself a the big scary face this is a simple fun build and very effective at projecting menace at the temple entrance it actually detaches very easily from the temple as pictured on the box art to allow easier access to the inside the eyes are flickfire missiles with scary faces hair conveniently providing ammo refills should you run out all in all from me b the back spin the skelly head and stone steps appear  we havent seen this feature in a while nice to get these pieces in dark bley a conquistador hides under the stairs  this is a bit useless as the stairs cant fully extend while hes there  moving right a trapdoor  what could possibly be behind it answer not much really a little red stair i really like these 2 stickers though  very intricate the staircase leads to what i like to think of as the crystal skull transmogrification chamber now i know nothing about the movie except that its supposed to be have a kind of 50s bmovie plot rumoured to feature look away spoilerhaters aliens these weird creepy gold chairs look made from the bones of aliens if you ask me with their strange vertebrae and silver claws it wouldnt surprise me if bringing these aliens back to life was part of the plot of the movie hence the crystal skull i guess well find out may 22 in any case transforming aliens clearly like a disco whirl as when you pull the handle the whole of this assembly spins giddily around a very clever and simple trick  its basically just a wheel under the platform but the effect is great also under here is a bottomless pit stickered i would very much expect a villian to be thrown down it at some point so do you come here often i dont know who designed this club these chairs are really uncomfortable nb i am really really over those pearl gold 1x2 roof corner slopes which started popping up in the 2006 castle range infected exoforce and have now spread here can we please have these in a different colour or a different pearl gold piece pretty please  c left tower looking from the front a small tower with a trans clear gem d right tower waterfall with booby trap i like the sticker its very cartoony which fits with the set somehow when you turn the wheel flick fire missiles spray out and hit whoever is on the stairs both towers have a trap where if you move the skull another one pops out from the dragon mouth e central turret thing this thing is kind of annoying and doesnt really sit or work well its kind of like a laser beam sending messages to space i guess as the central dome rises the two plates peel away i find it is a little bit tight to work smoothly and the two plates doesnt really sit well together at the top maybe i just need to rebuild it im sure this will also be explained in the movie f final trap  the stair that isnt there the final trap is at the front  as indy goes down the staircase you can push the red heads and all the 1x8 bley bricks come tumbling down simple and works well g alternate view heres how it looks as pictured on the box with the head removed as you can see this allows better access to the centre of the temple as you can see sadly there is nothing actually interesting there except a staircase to the turret and 2 dark tan slopes which are just stuck there and look a little out of place i mean come on everything else has a splash of dark red and gold your destination nowhere part 4 in conclusion so after all those endless pics what about the set itself consas a playset 7627 doesnt quite make sense admittedly the traps that are there are welldesigned and unobtrusive on the other hand theres a great big whopping entrance at the front  but i wasnt sure if the figs are supposed to sneak in through the backdoor and go up the spiral staircase and past the waterfall as shown in the box art or if they were meant to end up in the golden skull room the middle area doesnt really connect with anything nor does the giant space turret it may be that some of these questions are answered in the film but whereas with 7624 7625 and 7626 i could at least picture a story myself eg with river chase is fairly obvious whats happening  a chase down a river with a croc and a communist staking them out the temple set is a little all over the place the design feels a little off to me  not really bad but not really great either pros on the plus side the natives and crystal skulls themselves are great at 900 pieces this is also a great parts pack for dark tan dark red plant pieces gold oddments etc i especially love the baseplate in that shade i like the overall shape of the temple  a big staircase with secret nooks and crannies the build is reasonably interesting and there are some clever tricks with the traps but upon reflection i shouldnt have to sell this set  it should be able to sell itself as i said before im a huge fan of dark mysterious old temples so for that i have to give it some love it reminds me of the big old adventurers sets and the whiff of nostalgia is itself a powerful intoxicant however for the price lego is selling it in australia europe canada i couldnt recommend it as a mustbuy for full price when the smaller sets in this series are themselves so good review done  woo edited by imperialshadows 01 june 2008  1159 am	positive
the figs look great the natives and the skeleton conquistador are my favorite figures in the set the set itself is very good the interior sort of reminds me of an older style lego set for some reason it could be just me but it has a classic feel this will a great set to add to my list great review so far anyway i only saw the back of the box edited by general zen 01 may 2008  0217 am	positive
tinypiesrus on may 1 2008 1218 pm said i was really hoping that the conquistador helmet would end up being silver in the final set but i suppose its good to know that the helmet is being porduced again anyway and is the armour the skellie is wearing pearl gold hi tinypiesrus  i love that helmet too if only we had plumes again soon hopefully the armour is pearl silver not gold	neutral
looks great i cantt wait until i can get my hands on this and the other new ij sets this is turning out to be a really good theme im really liking the crystal skulls and i also think the baseplate looks very nice those natives look fantastic in my opinion thanks for the great review edited by erdbeereis1 01 may 2008  0253 am	positive

i know that alex54 had already reviewed this set beforehand but i wanted to give my 2 cents it is really more like 150 on this set i bought from toys r us on friday guess what the price had not been increased by a dollar like all other sets  this is my first review of a set ever dont be too mean 1 box it captures the potential i dont know how the scene plays out for now  action of the scene nicely and is very pleasing good job tlc  on the back it shows some of the play features of the set and a net little comic indiana jones seems to be surprisingly calm considering that he is about to be captured under a net and attacked by a snake the thing he fears most 1a comic not much to say on this 1b screw up at the top of the box both russian guards have the same grining face in the set one has the generic bad guy face from 7620 2 contents the box opens up to reveal a quartet of bags an uncrumpled manual yay and a sticker sheet boo 2a dss yoda said every for of rambling imaginable about this accursed item i have nothing to say meh 3 minifigs the only thing that has not really been discussed about the figs that you get in this set is that marion has a slightly new torso 4 parts of interest when i opened up the baggies these were the components that grabbed my attention a dark green alligator a net piece that i know has appeared in sets before hand  i needed it for a moc i am working on some raft part that is probably very old a ladder with two pairs of hindges and a dark brown version of this part 4 build amphibious vehicle this i one of the more enjoyable builds of the new line but that is just my opinion you start of with some thing very simple by the end of the next page it starts to bulk up more detail beginning to look like a car 4a build rear attachment bulk it up and add taillights done slap it on to the main vehicle 4b build front attachment i am running out of things to say bulk it up add some detail add a gun and headlights and attach to the rest to get the completed vehicle add stickers i honestly think that the amphibious vehicle looks much better with the stickers than without 5 build boat this build goes by rather quickly and adds to the playability of the final set base apply clamps add more to engine build more detail and a gun base finished boat plus stickers i love how lego slips in the product number into their stickers 6 build tree fort this is the weakest part of the whole set but i find my self liking it more and more for some odd and inexplicable reason that tan 6x6 will most likely see use in a pirate themed vinigete soon not mine  install netlauncher you spend the next two pages building this and putting it on a tree branch that is an ugly mix of brown dark brown and frown our commie friend seems to like coffee a lot second branch 3rd a wee bit to much on the coffee there dont you think final step the only redeeming value of this section is how well the net launcher works fantastically the rest is just utter fail 7 spare parts very little in terms of what is left over finished set all in all this set is a fine build and an excellent parts pack for dark green components i recommend this set strongly despite its few weaknesses	positive

very good for a first review i bought this set and jungle duel at target the other day i was going to wait and buy them when i go to downtown disney this summer but how could i pass up saving four bucks that i can spend on storeexclusives  and i have to say i absolutely love them the amphibious vehicle dont they call it a duck in the movie is definitely my favorite lego vehicle ive ever built everything about it is wonderful the size the colour scheme and its accurate to the one in the movie and irina spalkos hair is to die for on a side note i dont get why they made marions arms white in the set the shirt underneath her vest in the movie is obviously blue i switched the arms out for light blue ones and it looks a lot better and it makes marions eyes look great ryan	positive

while i truely fell in love one more time with the older lego city sets i thought why not make a review of one of the in my opinion greatest city sets of all time lets not talk too much here we go set nr 6395 name victory lap racetrack number of minifigs 13  number of pieces unknown release year 1988 starting with the beautiful old legoland box front back with some cool alternative models inside we continue with the great minifigs which are not less than 13 i dont think there is any city set with more figures is there civilians race crew  assistant personnel drivers all heres a overview of the whole set the rescue rig dont exactly know how to call it with trailer the score board  traffic lights which would be one of the details i love the most about this set the next sweet detail the camera  cameraman of course we have a doc if there is some kind of accident the pit stop boxes i love the small toolholder with the axle and wheel behind it the control room high above the racetrack ready to go that was it all in allall i can say is if you see this set anywhere on ebay ore somewhere else get it	positive

thanks for this review you have reviewed my most favourite town set of all times i am so happy to own this one i actually is a story to go along with it in the summer of 1998 i went on holiday with my parents to the country of luxembourg in the city of wiltz we encountered a small toystore which still had this set for sale 9 years after the release i did not had the sufficient amount of money to buy the set and had to leave it at the store i was practically in tears four years later we passed through luxembourg and i remembered the city and the store we made a detour and stopped by the same store every other old set was sold the only one remaining was this one i bought it immediately and treasured it ever since i use the baseplates a lot in my cities they serve well as roads with parking spaces next to them this was the first set i owned which had the huge 6x24 plates in them i remember my surprise when seeing plates of such enourmous lenght i recently made an entire racetrack together with this set and to promote myself i will place a link here	positive
metalandi thanks for this wonderful lovely review i enjoyed myself very much when i am looking through at the lovely pictures i must admit this is what i called a real classic race prix i miss those cute sweet little race cars which is able to contain a minifig furthermore this set offers 4 race cars and 13 minifigures in addition if town collectors remember the car number tiles are printed instead of using stickers this is the other set i owned which holds the similarity above 6381 motor speedway overall great review simonwillems on may 9 2008 0220 am said i recently made an entire racetrack together with this set and to promote myself i will place a link here i saw your entire racetrack it looks real exciting and i love your layout real nice edited by whitefang 15 may 2008  0956 am	neutral
nice reveiw i would fork out 100 aud for that set its just so bueatiful if only tlg rereleased this	neutral
ahhhh back in the days when shell was the racing fuel of choice before that octan company came to town bought off the old shell execs and ran them out of town on a rail but i digress i always liked the look of the set but at the time could not work out where i would be able to fit it into my town	neutral
wow simon you got two yummy	neutral
thank you for the nice review metalandi and thank you for the nice story and selfpromotion simon willems the racewaytracks were always nice dioramas in the catalogues of the eighties	neutral
i can remember when i saw this set in lego catalogues looking at it dreamin to have it like so many other sets and this one is still a dream i really like the design of this set it looks really complete with some nice details there are no lost place the strairs withe the foot bridge add a lot to it imo looking at the pics ive got a question  is the rescue rig trailer one piece or is it brick build	positive
hello all i dont believe there has been a review of this set yet so i wanted to take this opportunity up for review today is 8160 cruncher block and racer x as part of batbrick and iamded reviews here is the box i have to say i love the art on it its very colourful and makes the truck look a lot less crap than it does on the box plus you have to love the missile launching action bit right am i right why are you all staring at me and here is the back pretty generic but shows some nice details and so forth oh dear in turning around the box have i killed myself and iamded okey dokey up first is the best part of the entire set the minifigs racer x is wonderful though coming with a boring bruce wayne face but it is cruncher block his lady driver taejo that really shine look at those awesome suits the cool faces taejo has a ripped shirt now up is the first building part of the set with me and iamded looking rather slick in xs car while im not a big fan of yellow it is very nice and slopes in an underused colour is better than no slopes at all front view the new windshields are fantastic while a very cool car it is rather silly of tlc to give us the exact same one we got in the smaller set i didnt get the smaller set with this car so im still happy but it is a bad marketing move sorry iamded i know its your birthday butvroom now for the second part of the build and my favourite the front of the truck annoyingly enough this part opens up to shoot a pointless rubber projectile to do this you open the roof a nice detail btw and pull back the mechanism here thus blowing the front part open and launching itwell not far really the wheels and covers are pretty cool and the front is nicely designed the red looks good and the rear vision mirrors are a great touch and now for the most disappointing part  step three the trailer note  clicky joint piece not part of set just used to hold it up thats right almost the entire thing is open even the filled in side has holes id certainly be cared to be back there one bumpy hill and back you go i didnt put the lame computer stickers on and the control area is pretty lame in general not to mention taejo who is depicted on the boxart as standing at the desk would most likely just be sucked out the back at those speeds there are some pluses too though like the ridiculously awesome minifig paintings ill be using for wayne manor also note the control on crunchers desk that when turned turns the gun at the bottom its an alright feature here is an example ive shot iamded on his birthday what its a love ray havent you seen the care bears and though im not a massive fan of stickers this is just too cool the little aquarium is very simple but very clever using a printed piece between two clear windows to create the illusion of a tank it looks much better in real life trust me and here is a side view to better explain now to connect the two is a good thing i like the way a simple technic piece assumes the job oh and behold my hand the completed truck which while a mixed bag still doesnt look too bad i guess now the completed set which despite its unbelievable large flaws still looks cool warning the kickass iamded and batbrick figures do not come with this set more pics here httpwwwbrickshelycgii3147324 all in all minifigs 55  racer x is beautiful cruncher block and the driver too and taejo has a ripped shirt damn design 25  pretty poor considering the best part is available in a cheaper set and only the front part of the truck looks cool but still not truly awful build 35  despite having a bad trailer it was a fun build and sometimes you need something that doesnt take ages to make price 25  overpriced easily but rogue shadow is worse fun 35  the mere concept of such an open truck kept me playing with this baby for hours total 1525 not as bad as it would seem overall im really glad i bought it as the minifigs are fantastic and the paintings and fish tank are cool its fun stupid and downright ridiculous but while not a great set by any means certainly isnt as bad in the brick as it looks in photos until next time batbrick away edited by batbrick 13 june 2008  1220 pm	negative
awesome review batbrick i dont see any appeal at all really in this set but thats okay as i want to stick to castle anyway the car is the best part imo which you can get in a different set with another cool car and for a cheaper price but the main downfall to this set is the fact that the trucks trailer is half blown up and the survivors are magically staying inside and not being sucked right out of there as you have mentioned i would have thought tlc would at least included some sort of cover that you could take on and off easily kind of like the modular buildings having said all that though the front of the truck does look incredibly cool and those minifigs are sweet too bad they all have flesh tone printed on them so while this may not be my set of choice i can see the appeal well really i cant but its just my opinion im sure there are plenty others who would love to scoop this set up peace	negative
ill be passing on this set thanks for the review anyway is everyone supposed to be bald in the film it looks weird	negative
warning this reply may contain several minor movie spoilers if you havent yet seen the movie and want it to be a complete surprise do not read batbrick on may 10 2008 0605 am said but it is cruncher block his lady driver taejo that really shine look at those awesome suits the cool faces taejo has a ripped shirt i was originally skepitcal about the driver figure—i like the head but i was trying to figure out why they put in a female minifig with no hairpiece after having seen the movie i now understand why crunchers driver is a fairly manly looking woman and most of the lego hairpeices would make the minifig look too girly for the character  now that i know why taejos shirt is ripped up i dont mind the bits of fleshie color that are printed on it but i do wish they would make some of the new torsos a little more headcolour agnostictheres no real reason why cruncher and his driver couldnt have had ties that came all the way up to their necks instead of having those little wedges of flesh showing through loose collars yeah they are lowlevel mafioso type scum but they arent complete slobs batbrick on may 10 2008 0605 am said front view the new windshields are fantastic they are indeed very nice its the main reason i started looking at the speed racer sets in the first place batbrick on may 10 2008 0605 am said while a very cool car it is rather silly of tlc to give us the exact same one we got in the smaller set i didnt get the smaller set with this car so im still happy but it is a bad marketing move i think the error they made was in the smaller set though in the movie the only time we see crunchers semi is when hes being chased by racer x racer x and taejo do end up on the same team for a cross country rally race along with speed of course so i guess thats where they were going by putting those two together in the smaller set but it would have been much more interesting for them to have made up a set with taejo and one of the cars from the very goofy comic bookgimmicky teams they are racing against especially since one of the teams that is chasing taejo specifically is a bunch of armywannabee loonies—im sure more people would have loved some sort of darksand green racer with one of the ij soviets at the wheel than another racer x to summarize two racer xs is bad but it is the smaller set that should have been changed imho batbrick on may 10 2008 0605 am said annoyingly enough this part opens up to shoot a pointless rubber projectile thus blowing the front part open and launching itwell not far really as much as i normally dont like the stupid techic launcher thing and would rather not see it in a set ever again although one of these days i will make a giant multilauncer rig out of them just for fun at least there is a reason for it to be in this set as crunchers semi has a missile launcher in the front end of it in the movie i think youre supposed to lift the panel that hides the missile before launching it similar to the way that panels slide out of the way on the semi cab to allow for firing in the movie batbrick on may 10 2008 0605 am said and now for the most disappointing part  step three the trailer thats right almost the entire thing is open even the filled in side has holes id certainly be cared to be back there one bumpy hill and back you go im gonna chock this up to the standard lego philosophy of playset rather than model design for a lot of things the semi rig and raver xs car are the models the trailer is the playset seeing as how the trailer is crunchers mobile office rather finely appointed with lots of paintings and his pirahna babies in their tank behind his desk and the intent seems more or less to have a playest bit in order for kids to reenact the scene from the movie im not going to give them too much grief over this they tried to capture the basic bits of the movie set which we see mostly from the inside during the movie and translate it into a playset type environment that being said i do wish the back walls were more solid as i see no reason for there to be gaps in the back wall when the front wall or the fourth wall as the case may be here is already conspicously absent batbrick on may 10 2008 0605 am said there are some pluses too though like the ridiculously awesome minifig paintings ill be using for wayne manor also note the control on crunchers desk that when turned turns the gun at the bottom its an alright feature could have been a little better but its such a minor bit of this scene in the movie that i can see why they didnt spend too much time and effort on it it would have been nice to have more paintings though had the back wall been more complete and i like your idea of how to use them   batbrick on may 10 2008 0605 am said and though im not a massive fan of stickers this is just too cool the little aquarium is very simple but very clever using a printed piece between two clear windows to create the illusion of a tank definately a feature which is not showcased nearly well enough on the box art since it is one of the major features of this set in the movie its nice to see it translate rather well into brick batbrick on may 10 2008 0605 am said design 25  pretty poor considering the best part is available in a cheaper set and only the front part of the truck looks cool but still not truly awful that may be a bit harsh but not much given what ive said further up this post but it probably only deserves a 3 at best so im not realy going to quibble the point  i still think that racer x should be exclusive to this set and a different car should be in the smaller set with taejo which would have improved the cachet for this set overall batbrick on may 10 2008 0605 am said price 25  overpriced easily but rogue shadow is worse truethis should have ideally been about a 30 set especially given the general awesomeness of the ij race for the stolen treasure set unless they made the trailer a bit more detailed better back wall perhaps some drop down gun ports like in the movie or at put least one or more of crunchers goons in the set then maybe i could agree more with the msrp on that note if i remember correctly from my visit to my local tru yesterday in search of the new ij sets since local targets seem determined not to get them in stock yet they had this set on sale for around 35 along with an offer for a coupon good for 750 towards the purchase of a ticket to the movie with any speed racer toy purchase over 25 i may be wrong on the sale price but i know the ticket offer was there so if you havent seen the movie yet and are interested in this set tru may be the place to go right now to get both at a slightly cheaper price batbrick on may 10 2008 0605 am said fun 45  the mere concept of such an open truck kept me playing with this baby for hours so you did enjoy the playest aspect of the trailer even though you didnt care for the designlooks like they didnt do too badly then on what they wanted out of that bit  batbrick on may 10 2008 0605 am said overall im really glad i bought it as the minifigs are fantastic and the paintings and fish tank are cool its fun stupid and downright ridiculous but while not a great set by any means certainly isnt as bad in the brick as it looks in photos i was actually thinking about going and getting this set now that ive seen the movie and i understand what the heck is going on here more your review has definately added an additional impetus to that notion my pocketbook does not thank you	neutral
thanks for that fine review batbrick the most interesting part of the set for me are the neat mfs the trailer looks really pretty skeletal however it´s a nice little play set and´ll fit its purpose i guess	neutral
nice review good pictures thanks i think i may get a couple of the smaller sets as i think these will become collectors sets in years too come not sure this range will be that popular love the minifigs though	neutral
batbrick thanks for the sweet review you give me great insights into this set hehe i agreed that racer x is nice but i believe we can get it in the other set for a much lower price for me the trailer which does not have a cover is bugging me alot thats why i holding my reservations against this set at most i will consider the other 2 smaller sets for collection purpose nevertheless batbrick great job	negative
thanks for the review my wife wanted me to buy this for the fishtank and i came close untimately this set didnt offer many good part to me so i bought the smaller set with the same car the trailer is just too insubstantial	negative
thank you for the nice review	neutral
thanks for the great review it seems like the most awesome part of the set is the sticker sheet which is a reversal of the usual situation	positive
i really like this set my favorite parts are the minifigs and xs car vrooom	positive
i enjoyed the review some cool fleshie heads and parts but it does seem a bit lamer even than i imagined from the box the airy truck is rather slyly disguised on the box art i would like to get it if it is ever on sale 50 off would be nice  speed racer lego doesnt seem to be selling too well in local shops here	neutral
hi all newly arrived today dont you just love shop at home thought id give it a quick review see more details over at my site the tumbler jokers ice cream suprise	neutral

that is a very nice and quick review thanks for giving us a quick summary not much comments on this set as i do not really go into batman theme yet however the ice cream truck in the set interest me apart from that nothing much yet who knows maybe i will change my mind in the future	neutral
mustget	positive
nice review brickbitz i actually think this kit is really very nice for the size true you only get three figures but it seems thats a norm in most batman sets besides everything else is great the tumbler looks like an amazing build  they really nailed this tank of a ride and the ice cream truck plus this set does seem to have some neat pieces in it trans green popsicles and lime hubcaps anyone i think this far beats the rest of the batman lineup this year which seems quite disapointing overall edited by grevious 16 may 2008  0812 pm	positive
oh wait is that torso dark grey or light grey	neutral
ronan nissen on may 16 2008 1005 pm said oh wait is that torso dark grey or light grey its definitely dark grey	neutral
great review as always although i know you dont take many pictures in your reviewsimho  but can we see a little more about the tumbler is that little windshield down near the bottom front a third seat what is in the framework of the back behind the cockpit i know theres a blunt shooter and flick fire missiles but is it all framework	neutral
trooperdavinfelth on may 16 2008 1111 pm said although i know you dont take many pictures in your reviewsimho  but can we see a little more about the tumbler ill get some set up tomorrow in better light to be honest there isnt a lot to see most of it is just basic technic blocks underneath with all the slopes built up on top	neutral
thanks a lot for the review brickbitz i really love this set sure the figs are annoyingly not new but the ice cream truck is fantastic and the tumbler is a marvel of black slopes i see now that it is far too huge though i reckon i will either keep it that way as a mega tumbler mod it to become another battank keep it as a model tumbler or pull it apart and use the bits to make a tumbler like wetwires awesome one love those popsicles though and those wheels are very nice so overall as a loyal batfan i love the set even though it couldve been better batbrick away	positive
nice review i really cant believe that it is out already i love that new batman suit and the tumbler have they made the posicles before this is sure a must have	positive
a nice review of an interesting set thanks brickbitz a great new batman a funny ice cream truck and a pretty detailed tumbler and although i wish that vehicle would be just a bit smaller i almost wonder that it´s not even bigger compared to tlc´s other batvehicles and well the interior could be better too	positive
brickbitz on may 16 2008 1141 pm said ill get some set up tomorrow in better light to be honest there isnt a lot to see most of it is just basic technic blocks underneath with all the slopes built up on top some more pics of the tumbler	neutral
the tumbler is massive ill struggle to fit it into the cave but never mind the figs are nice the tumbler is pretty accurate or at least it will be after ive moded it and jokers tainted ice cream van is so very joker thanks for the review btw	positive
hey brickbitz i love how your review is not biased 10 ups in the end you said overall slightly disappointing most people post reviews only with praise but im glad you take both sides  enjoyed the review just like others have thanks so much	neutral
thanks so much dunamis for your awesome review  yeah i think tlc miss the cape it would be cool to own one but when we were talking of the 2008 sets around july of last year i can remember someone said it would come with cape finally is a little dissapoint tlc miss it  edited by darkrebellion 16 may 2008  0720 pm	negative
excellent review dunamis this set looks great the designers really though the kit out it seems the internal organs have got to be my favorite part but everything is good now all we need is a ucs obiwan with a laser pistol to finish off grievous in a totally anticlimatic way	positive
hey dunamis think you can get a straighton shot of the face the red pieces inside the eye sockets are topped with transgreenishyellow studs which make his face look eerily alive and very close to his screen appearance its a nice little detail that seems to not show through on pictures ive seen of the set the legs are a little wobbly im scared that hell be leaning too far forward in about 5 years	neutral

hi all again another one of todays special deliveries i think personally this set is great mars mission is really finding its feet 7646 etx alien infiltrator	positive
the walker reminds me of the old kenner cap2 captivator which is good	positive
thanks very much for the review brickbitz i love this years mars mission line and though this is the weakest set it is still a major improvement the mech is very cool and well made and the commander is one of my favourite alien figs ever the alien ship is pretty good better than last years ones but not extremely good either but i still like the set batbrick away	positive
thanks for the sweet review brickbitz that really is a neat little set that walker is fantastic most likely the best part of the set though the alien craft does also look neat and its cool how it can fold down into aa walker or rather a sentry turret seeing as it cant really move while in that mode still its nice my favourite part is the mini mining robot though so cute peace	positive
thanks for that interesting review brickbitz the alien fighter looks pretty nice nothing special but streamlined and fast nevertheless that transforming feature´s a nice addition for sure and these new flicker missile with its launch apparatus hmm i hope i won´t spend quite some time in search of that little rocket piece however there´s still something i miss with these alien crafts i don´t know i like some more organic looking design and they even come in some nice and different shapes but still perhaps a real space fighter just needs a solid cockpit cool windscreens and controls to satisfy my odd likings that exo suit looks really good and i wonder why it´s a little underrepresented on the box art the jet packspace scooter´s a really good idea and the only thing i hate´re those darned studless technic beams it could look so much better with a studded version of these parts but of course that´s only due to my personal preferences	positive
thanks for the review that makes me wanting this set even more	neutral
thanks for the review brickbitz i dont normally come into the space forum but this set it tempting me on the basis of you review i think i might aquire one at some point	neutral

thanks for the review nice little set and its around 2000	positive
my first impression upon seeing this set was no thanks but now im warming up to it still ill skip it if it interferes with my hypersonic operations aircraft fund p	neutral
thanks for the excellent review oky judging by this set the line is going to be promising i really like the figs and im glad to see that robot arm is actually a new arm mold awesome can a minifig hand fit in the end or just the chainsaw attachment could it fit an exoforce robot claw theres a lot of detail in the torsos and i like that the agents suit is like a motocross uniform i love that the snowmobile has a working tread copmike ras and i tried to build a snowmobile with working treads but we ended up using chainsaw blades in the end great work oky	positive
this is much much much more promising than the 2008 batman set for 1000 the vehicle looks like someone took time to design it but the batman one looks like  lego dear lego where is the quality for batman i really like the new cyborg arm and the propellers on that thing   it is a really promising line although i would get rid of all those bionicle pieces	positive
thanks for the review im looking forward to some of the new parts and ideas in this line the figures look great the actual sets themselves dont really appeal though	neutral
this set looks wicked thanks very much for the sweet review oky wan the pics are perfect great quality and the perfect size well done this sets got everything a new hairpiece tank treads a gem well i could go on but you can all see everything from the great pics thanks again oky this is one set ill definately be getting peace	neutral
huhm  i like the idea of the agentid  but offcourse all they want with that is that you buy all six sets  but it can be a good idea for children they wouldnt think of hey they get all money only because i have a little card with stars or something well not to rant i think its good also can you make that name yourself maybe set 5 comes with a extra stickersheed with all letters that would be nice agent rupee a very nice review oky wan kenobi rupee	neutral
oky wan thanks for this wonderful review i really have mixed feelings towards agents set haha but i love the agent minifigure the doublesided face is great and i love the sunglass look its nice that they made use of mutts hairpiece which is personally my fave hairpiece at the moment the jetpack is neat making use of the additional secure backing onto the minifig is really very smart	positive
nice first review oky wan  i´d say this is better than we first thought the minifigs looks cool and the overall look is ok and the excaustpipe is a new peace also i think agents on copmike	positive
i kind of like the set as said it has a very cartoonish style to it so im guessing the kids are going to love it and as a parent ill love it if the construction isnt to fragile  ill probably be getting a few for myself but only as parts pack copmike on may 18 2008 1129 am said and the excaustpipe is a new peace also i think yeah and its all over this years releases from what ive seen so far its found in racers speed racers mars mission and exoforce sets i just wish that instead of a 2x1 plate with an exhaustpipe in each end they would have made it an 1x1 plate with a single exhaust that would have been a lot more useful	positive
is there any chance u could post pics of the comic and the box i love legos box art and instruction art	neutral

ive copied another thing because i dont know how i must do a review and i cant do long reviews set ref 7884 name the buggy the escape of mr freeze number of minifigs 2 number of pieces 76 price 1395€ front of the box back of the box the comic very close whats in the box without the set the set with the box the time wow this is a funny set but its a little expensive and a little to small but i like some pieces like the fire and the mr freeze gun and the best of all here it comes no stickers thats one of the greatest things but i understand why lego has made this set some people want batman lego and they are most of the time expensive and the mr freeze set is also expensive but this set not if you want more pics you msut ask for exaple for the minifigs or the mr freeze and the blaster ask it and this is my first review and sorry for the great and blurry pics the final verdict 7510 figures 810 playability 610 build 710 pieces 7510	positive
very nice review riddler	neutral
thanks for an interesting review theriddler the set´s cheap and very useful to get two fantastic mfs a great mr freeze and a very cool new batman but i have to say that these two small vehicles just look plain ugly imho without any inspiration nor orginality sorry tlc but you can for sure do better than that and even with less pieces	neutral
nice review thanks i really like those little gokart thingies theyve got a fantastic mario kart look to them	positive
thanks for the review ill probably get one copy of this set mr freeze and his cart look neat i dont like the huge wing on the back of batmans buggy so ill probably mod that out	neutral
quote but i have to say that these two small vehicles just look plain ugly imho without any inspiration nor orginality indead the only reason to get this set is if you couldnt afford the batcave back in 2006 and want a mr freeze fig for a cheap price and anyone who did get that kit really have no reason whatsoever to get this wait did i forget something oh yeah  thanks for the review riddler edited by grevious 22 may 2008  1154 pm	neutral
thanks for the review for such a high price that we need to fork out compared to a total pieces of 76 its is very expensive to pay for such poor design but then i will still considered to get them as what sinner had said this is a very good way to get mr freeze without getting the batcave and it so happened that i do not have the batcave too i believed that is the cheapest set among the four so for the minifigs only this set is recommended other than that i am sorry	neutral
like many others ill buy this just for mr f quickly recycle the parts and pretend this set never existed the flame detail is indeed terrible the bat is back  and hes flatulent this third batwave isnt really doing anything for me ill get the penguin set as well for pretty much the same reason  although the sub on that is pretty cool  but skip the others maybe batbrick can make us all nice altmocs to improve these sets thanks for the review though	negative
thanks for the review theriddler this is a neat little set a bit overpriced in my opinion but for a new suited batman and a mr freeze fig in a set other than one of the most expensive batsets released its worth my money peace	positive
wowie im glad you like it maby il do the tumbler also but soon the batcycle and the scuba also come	neutral
neat little set i do like the parts a number of hard to find bits all in one pack depending on how much it costs in usd ill have to consider it and while the buggy designs kinda suck im a little happy to see them its been years since tlc made any small go kart style vehicles i guess tiny turbos have been overshadowing that market	positive
hollisbrick on may 23 2008 0239 pm said thanks for the reveiw the figs are bloody great but those cars are a bit well ill put it blantly retarded although they shall be good after some modding and whats with that grapple hook does it even have a rope so i guess batman will hokk it to mr freeze so his ride looks more ugle anyway can you pleese take some pics of the figs ill do and do someone also another review of the 7888 the tumbler	neutral
thank you the riddler  for this highly informative review despite the fact that i still consider it to be one of the weakest sets in all batman line i guess that now i may even get more than one of these for the same reasons as batbrick  good day gentlemen 	neutral
thanks for the review this set was poorly design when i first heard of it i think it was like a car with a much better design than this one i think i will get it for the minifigs	negative
the pics as promised extra part	neutral
thanks for the extra pics i dont think you could have gone into much more detail than that nice pics of the joker van too will you do a review of that one batbrick away	positive
in actuality i think that this may be my favorite batman set of all time i know i know  its a small set with crappy tiny vehicles so it probably sucks for the fan who likes to display sets but look at the mocing side and you see this set has a ton of potential new batman fig well mainly the torso but it looks nice sleek and armored a definite plus whether youre a mocist or batfan mr freeze because nobody bought the batcave when they should haveand by nobody i mean me plus i love that head cheapest way to amass the lightning piece the other sets that have it are lolhueg well not really but i dont have 50 to toss around on a little skeleton tower and its a great piece two little blue gems i may be alone on this but those are my favorite parts the gems and thats my favorite color for them 3 3 3 several other useful parts including a o piece in black some lightmedium blue bits from mr freezes kart the oddly placed grappling hook and some cheap wheels now i dont know about you guys but this is as close to a batman battlepack as were going to get lol  im buying at least three maybe more once i get my summer job  oh and the fact that the us price is only 10 helps a little but this year you guys cant complain  you got practically every set first especially the new castle tt trexxen	positive
coming in at around 50 us turbo car chase is one of the bigger of the new agents sets a big box with a helicopter car and gate in it seems like a winner but how good is it really and is it worth the cash lets start with the minifigs this set comes with a standard inferno henchman spy clops and agent chase the henchman is you basic lego criminal type with a gun and a jumpsuit nothing real groundbreaking here spy clops on the other hand is very cool for technically half of a minifig his head has a neat electronic goggle print and the rest of him is a torso mounted onto a set of six legs made from exoforce robot arms the whole thing is really well done and neat as hell agent chase turbo car chase  seems to have a standard agent body and a doubleprinted face with one side a sunglasses and headset print the other face is a determined agent look the set also includes a laptop with doctor inferno wallpaper the laptop is a new piece and works like the lego books that are in a lot of harry potter sets molding on the keyboard is really well done and the thing can be held by a minifig along either corner but not in the middle and not while closed the gate in the set is nothing revolutionary by itself and i sort of get the feeling that it was included to drive up the piece count and the set price point that being said there are some things to like here for instance the gate has four wheels of barbed wire attached to it the barbed wire is new and makes me want to start building some world war i trench mocs the rest of the gate is fairly big and it has a handy ramp attached so that vehicles can roll through it easily the main feature of the gate is a sound brick its much better then lego sound and light units of the past when the gate is opened it depresses a button and an alert klaxon blares that sounds every bit like a prisonbeak in progress the triggering action works surprisingly well and its pretty much for this feature alone that im not going to immediately break the gate back down and add it to my parts bin the designers did make an effort to create more then just a fence though a nice control panel connected to a big spotlight crowns the piece and a pair of cameras watch the opening its really hard to mess up a lego helicopter and this set is no exception the inferno chopper is a nicely proportioned and well built machine it looks properly menacing and has the uniform orange and black of other inferno property its armed with a set of four technic pegs cleverly used as guns on outriding mounts as well as a pair of the newerstyle flickfire missiles i personally dont care for flickfiring missiles but these look decent enough and seem to stay put so i really cant complain about them along the fuselage are a pair of intake pieces that ive never seen before and im guessing are new theyre pretty well designed and will come in handy for mocing down the road the action feature of the aircraft is the wench system this is very different then other lego wenches in that you build the entire mechanism and housing you can then use it to raise spy clops up and down from the bottom of the chopper using the rotor now this also keeps you from sitting there and just giving the rotor repeated spins to simulate flight im not too thrilled with that but there are a hundred other lego helicopters out there with fully rotating rotors so i guess i can let it by just this once as youd suspect the bottom of the cockpit is completely open which makes this a vehicle pretty much solely for spy clops sorry henchman but there is plenty of room beneath the body to attach a plate with some seats on it to accommodate another pilot without drastically altering the design or even removing existing pieces the turbo car is a slick little honey of a lego car and the silver pieces that make up the body work contribute a lot to that fact the front license plate appears to be an exofore code brick but it also hides the activation lever for the passenger ejector seat the seat works about as well as the spruce goose which is to say not well at all but here its the thought that counts the interior of the car is really well done theres even a radar screen for keeping track of pesky helicopters but the bondlike features dont end there a lever in the compartment raises pair of guns in the hood and a knob on the rear deploys a quad rocket system with more flickfire missiles this is a car that wont be stopped easily the rear has two cones sticking out id like to think theyre smoke nozzles or oilslick sprayers allinall this is a really good set the car is pure lego vehicle love and looks fantastic the silver pieces are very nice and its a shame lego doesnt use metallic colors in system sets more often there are however a lot of sticker for this set and i know how much that bugs a lot of people i personally like how much detail the stickers add to these sets and dont mind them so much the set also comes with an agents id card for chase which you can put little star stickers on from other sets as you get them its printed on a real nice piece of sturdy plastiboard and would be cooler if you could put your own picture and name on it instead of pretending to be chase sold by themselves the car and chopper would be musthaves all tossed together with the gate sort of makes the set a little less then the sum of its parts and with 498 parts most of them small thats not so hot its only slightly overpriced in my opinion but if you do shell out the money you wont regret it im very comfortable recommending this set to anyone close to perfect but the price and some minor flaws bring it back just a little id say 433 but out of 5 is close enough	positive
looks cool one of the best in this line cant wait for review	positive
chrome cant wait for the review deino	positive
deinonychus on may 23 2008 1012 pm said pics and thoughts tomorrow i picked up this set earlier in the week and was quite pleased with it in fact i have missions 15 and am happy with all of them  this series is much better than the old alpha team ever was i look forward to reading your thoughts on it i will say 2 things about it now though 1my set came with defective instructions in 2 places pages are missing and duplicates of other pages repeated for instance the car instructions are missing steps 1621 fortunately i was able to make out what pieces went where in the missing steps by studying the illustration in step 22 i hope you have better luck with your instructions 2this set contains the best lego sound brick ever its just begging to be incorporated into my arkham asylum	positive
mr mandalorian on may 24 2008 1158 am said what is a sound brick ditto maybe its like the exoforce lightup brick only with sound instead of light that would kick innapropriate word deleted	neutral
wow thanks deino for this great review i cant wait to get this myself but right now i gotta save for the cw sets the car is with no doubt one of the most mind blowing things tlg has come up with and we can only hope that there will be more models made out of almost only metalic colors the spider cyborg while not as innovative as some of the other cyborgs is a very nice fig and his head will be very usefull for splinter cell mocs and those intake pieces are only relatively new btw they are in almost all of the current 10 racers sets any chance of you taking a pic of a lineup of all the silver parts in this set edited by oky wan kenobi 24 may 2008  1132 pm	positive
great review deino man that car is just so beautiful and the helicopter is nice too unfortunately this seems pretty pricy and i hardly think ill be getting it any time soon what with my limited budget and all still its great to see how well agents is shaping up	positive
i love it  fun playable cool looking and killer minifigs sweet	positive
thanks for the review deino i love going back through the old agents thread just to see how wrong we were about these awesome sets i actually really like the gate those portcullis pieces people may know i always find nice uses for and i really really really want that awesome sound brick the figs are a bit disappointing in numbers but agent chase is very cool generic henchman are great and spy clops is one of my favourite minifigs ever the helicopter is wonderful too i love that it is customised for spy clops to winch him down the colours as usual for these sets are fantastic the dark blue orange and chrome silver the car is the best though i love all the functions how does the ejector seat work though batbrick away	positive
wow thanks for the great review deino this set is really a must have for me the sound brick seems great the helicopter looks very nice and the car is superb all of the james bond features are really cool though im very interested in how the ejector seat works or doesnt work the car itself is very sleek and full of beautiful silver and the inclusion of the new rims and windshield mean that i wont have to buy many speed racer sets as for the minifigs they all look great especially spyclops though it looks rather easy for him to fall off of his spider legs can you confirm this a great review of a great set thanks deinonychus	positive
thanks for the awesome review deinonychus this really is a sweet set a bit expensive a set for me as i only get the cheaper noncastle sets which is a shame because i love that head it would be great for some more cyborg troops the car is awesome i didnt expect it to have that many silver parts thats fantastic heaps of play features too that ejector seat mechanism sounds interesting thanks again for the sweet review peace	positive
deinonychus on may 23 2008 0912 pm said the rear has two cones sticking out id like to think theyre smoke nozzles or oilslick sprayers according to page 14 of my brickmaster magazine the left cone is for smoke screen and the right cone is for oil slick	neutral
wow great review thanks this set looks absolutely great but im afraid of the price oh weel ill just get the 2 smaller ones im really liking this theme well done tlg	positive
esjpg 4794k 110 downloads the ejector seat a long technic axle runs the length of the front of the car it comes in to the seat area here and nests into the gray joint which is attached to the small gray technic beam the beam is attached to the ejector seat bottom white 3x2 plate with a technic pin the seat in turn is attached to the side of the car with a technic pin the result is when the axle is pushed forward the gray joint and beam tilt the seat and eject a minifig after about 20 shots the minifig only went outside of the car 3 timesthe rest of the time he just bounced around the inside of the car so they get an a for effort but an f for execution	neutral
looking closely at the red cones on the missles and grey cones on the cars rear these appear to be a new piece note how there is a slight stopper ridge at the base of their top stud interestingly the trans green cones on the helicopter seem to be of the older mould style	neutral
thanks for your great review it looks very nice indeed the gate have very interesting mechanism the car looks very slick and cool it looks like those typical kind of james bond car this review gives me very good insights	positive
great review and fantastic pics deinonychus and a big thank you to whoever pointed out that you could use the sound brick for arkham asylum my addled brain didnt make the connection the car is just beautiful and with a good use for the most expensive part of the gate this is on my wish list for sure just have to see how much cash is left over after buying the new death star in a month or two agents has to be the biggest surprise from lego for ages without any pics it sounded soso but theyve done a brilliant job with it love those metallic coloured pieces	positive
great review thanks for sharing	positive
hello all eurobricks members i will present to you a very short review on the recent castle battlepacks this time i will be reviewing skeleton battlepack and i hope everyone of you do enjoy viewing it this was a request that put up by hollisbrick in the castle thread initally i thought it was a very simple set to do a review however for the love of castle i decided to whip this up for every castle fan out there this is an image of how the skeleton battlepacks look like i have bought 12 last packs of these in total so far but none of the crown battlepacks yet there were snapped much faster that i imagined do pardon me for the poor lightning today is a bad weather its hard to get natural light the skeleton gang for a single battlepack like this with an attractive reasonable price you obtained a series of 5 skeleton minifigs with tons and tons of useful castle accessories to me its a very very great buy and its a must to stock up for my army building some addons however i was not very satisfied with my skeleton armies standards therefore i decided to make some slight modifications with some additional castle accessories that is stocked in my castle warehouse after the makeover ok this is what i called a real skeleton army this is mainly my opnion and it have to be aligned with my standards i felt this improved battlepack gives a punch to the exisitng battlepack the two soliders on the right is able to align with the rest of my castle chess sets armies while the one on the left it gives me a great archer back up with the quiver and helmet attached to him the ones on the center especially the armored guard which equipped with the black nose cone helmet is my fave it is able to illustrate the elite among the rest of the guards with its armor and helmet which was featured in my castle deep forest expansion moc promotion on in addition the one which was hastly done with a modify mace it looks rather simple in time to come i will change it and gives a better equipment and look these are the remains i can use the axe for my dwarf in my dwarf mine defender in that set there is no weapon for my dwarf and i have to get it from other sets the rest of the accessories makes a very good stock up for future upgrading overall 910 this is not a playset it is mainly bought for its abilty to mass recurit any armies and is a main love for all castle army builders such as me this set mainly have no major faults and i love it so much although i have done some slight modifciations but this set is a must for me to buy more and more meanwhile i will need to wait for the next shipment hope everyone have enjoying viewing this simple review of mine edited by whitefang 25 may 2008  1252 pm	positive

whitefang on may 25 2008 0614 am said for a single battlepack like this with an attractive reasonable price you obtained a series of 5 skeleton minifigs with tons and tons of useful castle accessories to me its a very very great buy and its a must to stock up for my army building i wish these battlepacks had a reasonable price click here to see the canadian price of these battlepacks 18 dollars thats 6 dollars more than the starwars battlepack yet you get the same amount of lego or less then a starwars battlepack how the megablok does lego price its items  im gonna have to skip this set and a few others that i wanted because of this bloody outrageous back on topic thanks for the detailed review whitefang i also like your little changes to the set they really make this set look better	negative

sdpirate on may 26 2008 1040 am said no offence make this 799 can too expensive to be coming with only a few figures 20 earns you the same amount of figs plus a catapult barricade two horses and a jousting divider are you refering to these following sets both these sets adds up to 1800 cad and the skeleton pack have the same price of 1800 cad prices quoted from sh i understand that 7009 and 7090 offers more pieces horses and same amount of minifigs compared to a typical battlepack imo i feel that all 3 sets are all army building sets 7009 offer small catapult 3 minifigs a skeleton white horse 7090 offer a joust divider weapon rack good accessories 2 minifigs a horse with barding and a skeleton black horse these sets have different purpose for me buying multiples of 7009 is to build its catapult white skeleton calvaries while 7090 is to build on crown calvaries and black skeleton calvaries however battlepacks have a different agenda it offered some castle accessories that is not available commonly for a castle army builder like myself castle accessories are always in demand the black robe silver armor silver shortaxe are not very common castle accessories it can be used as a good stock up too i am not saying this battlepack is an one way solution to solve everything thats why different sets are released to target on different purposes	neutral
whitefang although i realize that the battle packs are great specifically for building armies and castle accessories which is why its such a shame that i wont be able to buy these things  while sdpirates sets are more for a catapult calvary whatever the fact to the matter is with the battle pack you get 5 minifigs with lots of accessories while with the sets that sdpirate showed us you get 5 minifigs with an okay amount of accessories 3 horses including two skeleton ones a ballista a weapons rack and a jousting barricade you cannot say that the battle pack contains the same amount of stuff that the other two sets have and therefore should be priced the same it just seems that lego is ripping off canadian army builders to me if the battle pack contained a small catapult or wall so that it contained about the same amount of stuff that the other sets had it would be fair it seems stupid that you will only get minifigs from one set while you can get about the same amount of minifigs plus a bunch of other stuff from two other equally priced sets that’s why to me these battle packs are a rip off because of what they contain imho the battle packs seem to be only worth about 10 dollars	neutral
thanks for the review whitefang your additions look great i like your mace much better than the use of a small technic cog your looks much sturdier and that helmet looks really great on skellie soldiers i never thought to use that before very cool indeed peace	positive
thanks for sharing these closeup images of this battlepack whitefang i actually had this set in my hand at legoland cal and could not decide if i wanted it im currently out of castlemode with my large indy jungle set up on the table and creating ghost train mocs that are starting to line up on the bookshelves once i buy the troll ship ill want to start collecting these great fig sets thanks again for sharing	neutral
thanks for the nice review whitefang i got the knights bp just for the scared face	neutral
sorry to be going a little off topic here but personally i have just bought 40 crowny battle packs for the only reason that i am running out of space to store the left over blocks about 500 of my crownies came from sets mentioned above on sale which would have been cheaper than the battle packs thanks for the review whitefang but i dont think i will be buy any skeleton battle packs that army is large enough	neutral
thebrickster on may 28 2008 0121 pm said for those of you who buy so many of this and the other battle pack with crownies what do you do with all of them is this simply to create a largescale army or do you plan to build large castle scenes with all the figs id love to see some pictures on the share your castle army thread i am a army builder and hope one day to make large scale castle battle scenes time is a huge factor at the moment i have to work so hard to pay for all thislol there is a queens birthday holiday coming up on the 9th of june here in australia thats the deadline i have given myself you will definately see my army in the share your castle army thread thats the beauty of the battle packs the figures come armed	positive

ive always wanted to see this set closeup voltio thanks for sharing the image review this is the only jungle adventurers set i dont have and its got some great unique pieces esp those leaf brick pieces whats great is theyre not stickers this is a really a nice review of a neat set with the extra little humor you shared thanks again for taking the time to photograph and share over eb	positive
great review for a great set man i loved the adventurers although the new indy sets are good they will never match up to johnny thunder most of all no stickers great review	positive
thanks for this great review voltio i never knew of this set till now and it really looks great i never paid much attention to those aztecincan style sets which i now regret i love the bright colours used here and all the great traps theres so many of them which is exactly what we can expect from an old incan temple like this one im surprised theres no catapult anyway the minifigs included are also great and am i right in guessing those bricks are printed that would be fantastic as they look amazing that boat hull is new to me too although i guess the fact that its mainly in belville sets explains that pretty well thanks again for the sweet review do you have any other jungle adventurers sets you plan to review peace	positive
im gonna start searching ebay	positive
thanks for reviewing this rare set since it came out in 1999 i have only seen this set in a toystore one single time one single copy as well it was in the summer of 1999 in belgium arlon in a store called maxi toys belgiums tru i think they had the three biggest junglesets for sale there these ancient ruins the set with the beautiful black boat and the zeppelin being into adventurers at that time i had never seen the entire jungle theme not even in a leaflet or catalog and surprised as i was i bought all three sets that was one happy dutch boy in belgium surprisingly the two smallest sets made it in very small quantities to my local stores in holland except for the pontoon plane and small raft which was my very first shop at home order the spiders secret i bought off bl which makes me the proud owner of the entire jungle serie back to the set this was the first time in a long history of collecting lego that i had a deformed piece an 2x8 red plate was twisted i twisted it back and it still serves its purpose i loved the whole steamidea in this jungle serie the two boats both including the one in this set had nice steamengines and a very cool mechanic yours has the wrong hathair btw to come along with them the skeleton falling down on the end of a chain was the most intriguing part of this set for me it worked really well and when you were done scaring minifigures you could winch it up again ready for the next go the only thing i did not really like about this set was the difference in wheelsize on the car front small back large and the way the palmtree consisted out of just three parts all in all a great set that is becoming more rare and expensive as we speakpost get it edited by simonwillems 26 may 2008  0759 pm	positive
great review i just barly missed the jungle series growing up with half a year of jungle and mainly orient expedition and dino island i like egypt more but this set despite the 4x4 palm tree is practically perfect i love the detail and vibrant colours gotta say ive got a thing for pippin reed myself by the way what does vhtf mean edited by sdpirate 28 may 2008  0106 am	positive
vhtf very hard to find to answer some earlier replies no there are no stickers in this set while some adventurers sets of the era had stickers the 5956 zeppelin had tons all of the interesting mesoamerican designs from this set are printed also simonwillems was correct my mechanic is missing his hat which should be a black kepi theyre extremely expensive on bl though proving once again that this set has some awesome parts so i ordered a replacement from lego its in the mail and should come soon	positive
the printed pieces are the real gems of this set beyond them there isnt much to this set though the boat hull is nice the model itself isnt all that great the new akator temple is definately a superior model at least in piece count but those printed pieces are hard to resist steve	negative

i just rebuilt this entire set today and the nostalgia was totally worth taking bits and pieces from a few of my own mocs only now did i realize how rare some of those pieces are and im rather thankful that i have all of the printed pieces and achu the only pieces i am missing is a transparent orange headlight 3 out of 4 black minifigure hammer light gray chainreplaced it with a dark gray chain and one whole minifigure which is the mechanic guy i still have both the instructions and the box and both are in appalling conditions kudos to the pre2000s lego sets like this one love em	positive
wow good review i used to love this old sets as i was greatly fascinated by inca and aztec cultures and the mayans technological marvels astounded me i was thrilled to death when lego released little aztec figures so of course i jsut had to buy some your narration with the sig fig was hilarious and the review was all around wonderful keep up the good work mate	positive

this has gotta be the coolest chopper ever i love it its so accurate plus your review is great because it shows all the inner details	positive
great review this does look like an excellent set great chopper	positive
great review 5150 although you might want to resize your pictures before posting them so they dont take forever to load quote wow i was skeptical of this coast guard line i was actually the complete opposite ever since i saw the first pictures i fell in love with the whole line the helicopter looks to be one of the two best in the line right up with the 4wd and jetski great job tlc and i do hope you have something equally as great planned for next year	neutral
very nice job on the review 5150 i definitly like this set much better now that i have seen good pics of it i am definitly picking this up as soon as i can again great review  model on	positive

thank you for that fine review of a really excellent set 5150 lego i never saw a little juniorization done that good before	positive
thanks everyone for the nice coments its nice to finaly have a camera that can take some decent photos makes doing reviews much more enjoyable klausdieter on may 28 2008 0917 pm said thank you very much for the nice review 5150 lego the helicopter is  apart from that it is very very big and that it does not include any interior  a very nice set  the most i like the life raft becuase it is simply  nevertheless i dont know if i buy it probably not  but its very nice two questions  where can you fasten the stretcher on to haul it up and down is the motor working with batteries klausdieter there is no real way to lift up the stretcher due to the crane arm being in the way there really isnt any room for any kind oflifting straps the set does include a 1x2 plate with a hinge for the diver to stand on so at least he can hold on to someone the crane lifts them up and then he can put them in the strechter thats my guess at least as far as the motor i dont believe it uses bateries since you pull out the motor and all the button does is recoil the winch line back in i have to say it does a very good job of that and is very smooth as long as you dont have anything to heavy one detail i forgot to meation is the shark its nothing new just the basic shark lego has had around for nealy 2 decades but it was a detail nothing less	neutral
nice review the helicopter reminds a sikorsky chopperisnt it	positive
all stickers im afraid though imnot a fan of stickers myself some sets like ferrari for example take longer to put on than building the actual set this one is not as sticker heavy as it seams though and the ones that areon there really give the set that extra touch printed would have been preffered of course but in this case i didnt mind it	negative
thats a very nice set im having my doubts about getting it though still the overall shape and size of the helicopter remind me of the reallife ch53 military cargo helicopter a very nice review youve got the photography down very well i feel perhaps a bit of nitpicking but at the end where you assign a rating if you do a rating with faces which is fine by me you may want to seperate the faces by a line otherwise it may become too crowded to the eye	neutral
oky wan kenobi on may 30 2008 0919 pm said but i have some questions about the grey new parts in the life raft are they 1x1 like their counterparts with the clips or 1x2 and can they be held by a minifig by the handle  btw which jedi has an orange eta 2 i guess it should work with mfs hmm i think it´s count citrus	neutral
im rather fond of helicopters and have built many different types this doesnt really remind me of any particular model other than perhaps an eh 101 merlin and even that resemblance is very superficial just for the record this is a sikorsky sea king and this is a sikorsky mh53 a derivation of the ch53 the only resemblance i see with the former is the colour scheme and with the latter the fact that its got a fat rearend sponsons and six blades it doesnt matter though because i really like it the colour scheme is great the shape is nice its got quite a bit of detail and i just have to get my hands on the cockpit window and those new rotor blades when i first saw the large aircraft pieces a few years ago i figured they were very much singleuse parts but the tail end doesnt look too bad pretty clever i like the raft too it really does look like the real deal that the helicopter cant lift it really isnt an issue because in real life they wouldnt lift the raft either theyd use the rescue hoist to lift the occupants of the raft into the helicopter one by one or perhaps in pairs imagine a storm with a helicopter hovering over tall waves with a big fat raft strung from a cable underneath it the raft would catch a lot of wind and flop around quite a bit causing it to loose all its occupants and also yanking the helicopter around possibly causing the pilot to loose control and crash bad idea cheers ralph edited by ralphs 30 may 2008  1109 pm	negative

great looking set loved the review pictures were good sometimes blury but i think i will pick this up after i get the rest of the kotcs sets riddler a tip i learned in photoclass is to take a breath in and hold it while pushing the shutter so you dont accidentally move while breathing i thought it was silly but it does work again great review looking forward to more	positive

great find and thanks for the review inertia on may 28 2008 1108 pm said undoubtably better than its newer counterpart the mt101 armored drilling unit care to explain why personally i think that aside from the colour scheme the new one is far better why suspension more enclosed cockpits buglike appearence i suppose its a matter of personal opinion though	neutral
great review of a great set i always figured the hoses were welding torches attached to jetpacks yeah as the whole thing had the vibe of a mobile repair center much like many of my favorite sets this one has a base of simple bricks and plates and then from that solid foundation the rest is built out to be decorative or have the action features this gives sets a very solid feel as demonstrated in this set the first snowspeeder and galaxy explorer the mm armored drilling unit has a more technic base giving it a less solid appearance and though i like the set that jet that luanches from the back is horrible partially because of the useless orange containment things the mega core has a nifty crane instead of a big useless jet tohst	positive
sinner on may 28 2008 0235 pm said care to explain why the mcm has a pure weight of parts that i find hard to quantify but love it is just so dense when you build it full of nice surprises no technique required and a wonderful stearing mechanism that i rank as more important than the suspension of the mars version this thing was meant to crush anyway who needs suspension i also like the way you never felt that the mtrons deserved a base after building this it was that good the colour scheme was perfect its space and i like it enough said great review btw god bless nathan naturally youre entitled to your inferior opinion	positive

fun review thanks kinda sad to think that with tlcs recent ban on magnets in their products well never see an mtron revival 	neutral
i love the design of the front canopy of this set but i always felt that they could have done more with the rest of the model this set is good candidate for customization though there is quite a bit on unused space inside especially in the middle section i want to try putting a technicstyle engine into mine at some point along with the necessary gearing i got my mcm brand new off ebay some years ago for a pretty good price but the box was very worn out and the big transneon panel which floats freely inside the box was a bit damaged as for the hosejetpack things i always assumed that they were either welding torches or flamethrowers take your pick quote kinda sad to think that with tlcs recent ban on magnets in their products first time ive heard of that what are they going to do for the train couplings	neutral
fluyt on may 28 2008 0156 pm said since when is that the new train couplings have magnets only with a special casing youre right i should have clarified  its the old loose magnets that apparently are being discontinued not all magnets altogether as you noted the new train couplings still have magnets but they appear to be permanently attached to a fairly large housing which i guess will prevent kids from eating them but the old mtron round magnet pieces are presumably discontinued	neutral
thanks for the review maybe i can pick one off ebay	neutral
it looks like youre right about the old magnets i got a few off pab two months ago but they no longer have them i guess i should grab some while theyre still widely available on bricklink as they can be useful in a number of situations on a side note one interesting thing about this set is that it seemingly had two uscanada names mega core magnetizer and multi core magnetizer brickset lugnet and all the other sites ive seen call it mega but i have some north american catalogs from that time period that call it multi and the box also says multi on it i actually didnt know the mega name at all until many years after the mtron line	neutral

thanks for that fine review of a really classic and impressive mtron set inertia tohst on may 28 2008 0455 pm said the mm armored drilling unit has a more technic base giving it a less solid appearance  yeah it´s pretty sad some of these new sets just look very cool at the outside but appear to be hollow and blank at the inside especially with the annoying use of studless technic beams to mod these sets often means to change the whole inner frame leaving us with a bunch of imho not really very useful parts it´s not a very honorable marketing strategy to produce set designs that´re aimed to look impressive and cool on the box art but´re pretty useless in their inner structures of course i don´t want to offend some technic lovers and although i always was more the system kind of guy why can´t they just use some technic beams with studs at least i grew up with just imagine with pictures of alternative models on the box and i don´t think it´s that easy especially for younger kids to mod some of these terrific blownup sets like it once was with sets like this one here implosion off	positive

this super set contains many of the city sets you can get for your mini city hospital the smallest set is the 7902 car with a doctor i thought it looked a bit too slow here is a car you can build with the same bricks the instruction manual for the ambulance does contain a picture of an alternate model but it is actually quite hard to build something significantly different this sets lacks some snotbricks so i had to be a little more creative and came up with this ambulance it is more a hearse than an ambulance the helicopter has a lot of slopes so i built a speed boat for those special emergencies unlike the first two sets i used far from all the bricks in this this set does really have some great parts the brickshelf gallery with some more pictures is anyone up to the challenge and build some alternate models of the last set in the super pack  the hospital	positive
these are great i especially love the speed boat and your ambulance reminds me of ecto 1 i would take you up on your challenge but i dont own the hospital it seemed overpriced to me	positive

brickadier general on may 29 2008 0727 pm said hi all so i was at the walmart yesterday and had the munchies and was looking for something to eat somewhere along the line i stopped caring about food and decided to browse the toy department to see what they had legowise thank you very much for that neat review brickadier general  i´m glad that you changed your mind a review of a burger wouldn´t be half that interesting for sure it´s just a mediocre set to me but of course it´s always cool to get important mfs in less pricy sets i like the penguin´s sub from the batcave more just because they did a fine job on resembling a penguin without using a sticker robins craft looks fairly nice but the most useful parts of the whole set for me personally would be those indeed very neat green engines	positive

set 8635  agents  mobile command center pieces 1154 price us8999 those dedicated agents theyve fought chainsawarmed villains battled radiocontrolled cyborg crocs chased pallets of badlystored golden loot and wrestled killer sharks with vicious toothy grins finally theyve caught the notorious dr inferno and imprisoned him in their cavernous mobile command center but dr inferno wont go down without a fight can the agents stop the evil dr disco inferno fleeing will spy clops laser gun burn through the door in time or will dr inferno simply use the lovely agent traces enormous ponytail as an escape ladder to freedom more importantly will there be a riot in the streets of lego city as afols go apopletic at the thought of a 12 wide truck roaring through their ordered town layouts stay tuned part 1 the box instructions parts as the largest of the agents sets so far the box is easily the biggest trainee agents examine the following three pics and see if you notice anything odd box front box back box middle spot it thats right the printed cardboard which has supposed to be the bottom half of the fold out middle section is on the back slicing the ultralarge set image which would form the foldout in half  the way the cardboard is printed as one piece before its folded i think this would be very hard to do accidentally so suspect a major stuffup somewhere along the production line i bought this set off bricklink so would be very interested if anyone in the states who has seen these boxes actually on the shelves can tell me if this is common or rare basically i want to know if i should be annoyed that the bricklink seller didnt list this in the set description or are they all like this the instructions come in 4 booklets the parts list comes in at 5 pages which is a lot even at halfsize pages  large images of the parts inventory are in this folderwhen moderated for anyone interested heres also some cute agentstype artwork at the end of one of the books instructions show piece callouts and are divided into sections according to numbered bags as youd expect for a set with 1100 parts this baby comes with a lot of bags its a treasure trove of dark blue as well as the obvious large slopes and wall panels which make up the body and the roof there is a wealth of smaller navy blue pieces as well  small 1x1 bricks 2x2 bricks 1x1 plates 2x2 tiles heaps of 2x plates some slopes 22x cheese pieces basically anyone wanting a lot of dark blue should think about this set the roof panels alone for example could provide a dark blue sea for a modernised pirate moc 2 dsss dreaded sticker sheets quelle surprise  stickers the grey parts of the stickers here are metallic silver ink which is a nice touch actually as sticker sheets go theyre not too bad fairly subtle for the most part and the navy blue actually matches the bricks themselves however after looking at the sticker sheets i thought i was missing something what about the pieces used for the projection screens showing dr inferno and the sharks  why werent they on the sticker sheets there must be another one frantically i checked and rechecked the box and flipped through all the instruction manuals to find the elusive 3rd sheet where was it ten minutes later i noticed something which had honestly never occured to me  there were actual printed pieces in this set so obvious and yet so unthinkable its horrifying how years and years of exoforce and speed racer set releases can mentally condition peoples thought processes tut tut lego what have you reduced us to here they are folks  actual printed pieces yes i do believe this news deserves the caps i also noticed this nifty modification of the usual 2x3 cupboard  you can now fit drawers in it very clever this may have been around in belville sets for years for all i know but its new to me the drawers slide in and out very well and the top one sits on slight indentations in the middle of the cupboard part 2 the figs our trusty agents  charge chase trace and fuse high powered agents dont have time for names of more than one syllable  thats why the bad guys always lose  chase and fuse have the mutt hair in black and dark orange the lovely agent trace has an exquisite new hairpiece in dark brown perfect for rapunzel themed mocs as you can see her ponytail is loooong makes it hard to sit down the poor girl i feel sorry for all these female figs with such intricate hairstyles that they can never relax in an ordinary lego chair however at least she has two breasts unlike the recent harley quinn fig compensation indeed seriously though its great that theres a separate torso print for the female character and this attention to detail is typical of the set as a whole three of the agents have reversable heads  nice touch with the headsets and i like the id cards on their pants obviously the agents security system is based on some kind of crotch measuring device this would make sense considering the conspicuous bulges in the pants of dr infernos men see the other agents set reviews the villains  spy clops dr inferno gold tooth dr infernos hair in all its glory this is a great piece although the orange colouring is a little rough on the front its so 3d it deserves a back and side view and indeed eb thread all of its own as mentioned elsewhere this is different plastic to the normal minifig hair but it doesnt quite feel as soft as the exoforce hair it doesnt fall off as much anyway the figs get 1010 from me awesome hairpieces in great colours for the agents and a sleek navy blue neon green uniform the villains faces are great and they are all very distinctive the attention to detail is outstanding and its great to see a lego inhouse theme with characters as memorable and cool as figs from the licensed themes  part 3 the build the build is divided into three stages  the small vehicles the front of the truck and the massive command center section a small vehicles first up all the small vehicles we have a small flyer 2 buggies jet ski and a speed boat  all in glorious navy blue with little bits of silver detailing top view these vehicles are all simple small and welldesigned probably the weakest is the flyer only because the cockpit looks a little large in fact the small flyer is probably the weakest element of 8365 overall which tells you how good the set itself is in various threads here this set has been heavily criticised for being way out of proportion theres a reason for that as we shall come to however the existence of these small sets should appease some people with the new coast guard sets for example all of these save the flyer wouldnt look out of place on a city beach with a little modding heres an example  agents beach party spongebob couldnt help but crash the villains only have one small vehicle but theyve been wellserved in the smaller sets and this one is a unique and clever design i love the triangular shape and the simple but clever technique of making the arch slopes meet up around the propellers its sort of insectile in black and orange and looks very different from the usual assortment of helicopters etc b truck front this thing is a beast seriously look at it its chunky and mean looking you dont want to mess with this baby the build is really nice like a lot of star wars vehicles its all based on technic beams pinned together unlike a lot of mars mission sets underneath isnt all technic beams with some plates slapped on like a facade the majority is a lot of plates and bricks which all fit together solidly you can see from the detailing of cheese grater slopes and silver pieces on the front how effort has been made to give this vehicle a distinct feel different to other lego sets sure the silver slope mirrors might be a bit too much for some but this baby is all about attitude you can imagine it roaring down the road en route to dr infernos diabolical lair after all these sets are agents sets  nobody said they were secret agents c  command center  whole assembly heres a view of the whole thing assembled  inside and cool details to follow at the end its kind of hard to show here as it is extreeeeemely long this is indeed a big set the build for the trailer part of the command center is fun and very satisfying yes there are large pieces but there is also a huge amount of detail it is also solid as a rock i remember being annoyed building the big ferrari truck a few years ago  everytime you looked at it an 8 x 16 plate fell off the mobile command center is solid  even with the hinged roof and special features it is not delicate at all kudos to the designers again as it is mainly a brick build rather than a technic one i also like how the command center part connects to the cabin  its not a special piece at all just a technic axle going through two circle plates but it works and its solid please note ive been selective about which stickers ive applied during the build top view the rear heres an example of why i like the build a the designers have enough sense to put a ladder so a minifig can climb up to the interior when the command center is open b notice that although the ladder clips at the top there is an extra clip there in the middle purely to hold it in place so it doesnt flap around and holds firm i dont know if most designers would even think to put a ladder there let alone go the extra mile and put a mechanism to hold it in place pure class oh and notice the greebly detail stuff to the right there too the other side this is probably the other weak part of the build  the bricky gaps at the top where the hinge to open the roof sits its a little gappy but the set is so big you dont really notice d and now for the fun stuff  inside and neat details ok so weve built the thing its big its blue the top of the trailer itself would make a good warehouse moc for a harbour layout but what about inside is it any good what about all those small vehicles from the start of the review where do they go well im glad you asked because the solution is superb the small flyer folds slightly and slides into place here lift off the roof and youre away the large buggy and the speedboat go under here the jetski slides out of the rear here attached to its own little platform and the small buggy goes inside the main cabin theres even a crane so you can lift it down so now we know why this set is so large to fit everything in its amazing that this functionality doesnt affect the aesthetics of the set as a whole but we still havent finished on the details the front section has a very easytoswingopen roof section and missiles theres also a command section underneath the bit where the flyer lifts out and now for the interior i have to say i really like this space not only is it packed with great stuff theres also enough room for minifigs to move around i hate bases where the figs only have about 2 studs to actually stand and walk aquabase invasion is a nice set for example but the actual functional space inside the base is teensy claustrophobia you know within a week theyd be fighting to toss each other out of the airlock no such problems for these suave agents who have plenty of legroom and the ability to launch missiles from their ceiling the whole of the interior zooming in moving from left to right first off the medicine cabinet looks like someones been leaving secret mission dossiers lying around the projector area for mission briefings dr inferno recently changed his hair colour from purple to orange it seems why are all these minifigs so obsessed with their hair the projector folds down when the trailer is open push the button and the light glows on now dr infernos hair is orange again this is one of my favourite parts of the set it works a charm the batteries for these lightbricks can also be replaced  instructions are in the manual agent charge considers sharkfin soup for dinner did i mention these projection panels are printed the detail is very fine too the tool section laptops sit in the middle compartment you get some flippers yellow scuba tank and various implements im so impressed that the helmet is pearl silver with a different coloured visor too  theres so much variation in the parts in this set you dont get the sense the designers are using the same thing over and over to save money it all feels luxe and topoftheline just like the command center itself two laptops  yay the aforementioned rooftop missiles the dr inferno cage nasty electric shocks bzzt you can see my reviewing skills are burning out now  sentences truncated another example of detail  nowhere else in the set is a 1x1 transgreen tile used  they could have used a 1x1 trans green cheese wedge piece as there are others in the set but they didnt how does dr i get out flick that lever on the right hand exterior and the door pops open spy clops the loyal minion awaits his master on the other side and there we have it take a bow guys theres a lot of spare parts a suspicious amount of dark blue small slopes but i checked the instructions and didnt see anything missing i have to say i do like the new policy since speed racer i think of including these small slopes as extras part 4 overall rating if youve made it this far youve got more stamina than dr infernos army of cyborg animals themselves as i said earlier this set has drawn criticism for the size of the truck however large vehicles do exist  i grew up in a wheat farming area and as a kid the size of the lorries that thundered past carrying grain was probably intimidating to me as this monstrous espionage machine is to the good citizens of lego city on top of that it does contain a plethora of 4wide vehicles inside  criticism of this set on the basis of size to me also seems misguided as this is basically a playset  and it is a very good one to boot as you can probably tell i love it to pieces and wouldnt hesitate to recommend it to anyone whether for parts or for play value check out the parts list in this folderwhen moderated and you can see just how many excellent pieces it contains a lightup brick a flood of navy blue metallic silver bricks  were spoiled 8635 is also an enjoyable build with fantastic figs and topoftheline detailing in a year when ive found city a bit disappointing after the run of great sets in 20062007 the agents line has been one of the surprise hits for me and i cant wait to see what the designers come up with next edited by sveltecorps 02 june 2008  1246 am	positive
yay i was waiting for this to be reviewed cant wait to see how it is i love the look of this set edit wow fast going on the review there sveltecorps i love the look of the instructions batbrick away edited by batbrick 31 may 2008  0610 am	positive

me want this set	positive
you know i like many had doubts about these sets when they were first mentioned but ive decided i want the whole line now this set is the créme de la créme just beautifully stunning that is a great review sveltecorps you have gone into fantastic detail and description of all the elements really it is this review that has persuaded me to buy this set i blame you the minifigs are great the vehicles are better and the truck and interior is awesome the few minor draw backs are far outweighed by the attention to detail and the many unique and cool elements used in this set and printed pieces that is even better great job you have obviously put a tremendous effort in making this review and i for one definitely appreciate it i am looking forward to these sets being available in new zealand	positive
wow like others have said i was unsure about these when i first heard about them but then looked at the first leaked pics and thought they actually look pretty neat now i have seen all the reviews i have to have all these sets at first i was thinking they would be great as parts packs but the more reviews i see the less i want to use them as part packs and just keep them as built or buy 2 so i can do both  cant wait till they hit the shelves in the uk thanks for the review	positive
thats an awesome review and a great set it seems with all of this years star wars i still havent got rogue shadow i cant afford agents too which is a shame looking at this	positive
wow great review of what seems to be a great set i love that ponytail this looks to be a must have set it probably wont stay together for long though thanks very much i fixed the header for you thats two you owe me the other is for making me think that this set was in australia 	positive
sveltecorps a fanastic review of this biggest agents set at first i was not very keen to have this set however after reading your review you have make me swing up and down its simply fabulous thanks for your hard work i am sure its not easy to do this review i love that female minifig she looks awfully sweet especially with her new hair great job	positive
omg thank you thank you thank you you made my day so that means dr infernos hair isnt rubber but one question is it like that weird funny soft plastic like the ants from indy 4 please answer	positive
thanks for another wonderful review sveltecorps a very fine set indeed i absolutely love the way all of the vehicles fit into the command centre very clever the projector is really cool it looks very nice its great to see these light and sound bricks in the agents sets all of the little nooks and crannies in the centre are great too i really love the amount of detail featured mixed with all of the playability of this set the minifigs  as usual  are brilliant the uniforms look fantastic dr inferno looks especially great i love his white suit with hints of orange and who can forget his hair im really tempted to buy this beast now though im not sure my wallet will forgive me for it i suppose ill have to cut back on indy and castle multiples for now thanks for the truly great review sveltecorps nice work	positive
wow this set looks so amazing amazing genius davinci art i say youve done an excellent job reviewing and really this is the review ive been waiting for so cool so classy i love the mission briefing feature to think that lego could go so high as to put something ingenious like that in there too bad lego figures dont have fingers to make shadow shows eh genius the jet lauching feature is pretty slick and they even put a control center in there too thats beast loving that the bottomi dont see how that big buggy can get out or in there but awesome too the back of the truck could use more detailing i think but the jail popopen feature is pretty cool as is the speed boat storage rack cabin its great that roof opening feature is a great part of this set also i think you can have multiple figures up theremaybe you can mod it to put a bed in there it certainly looks big enough inferno plane wow that think is smooth baby i love how the wings contain rotors inside of them thats awesome detail right there that is a sweet ship thingy so slick the rest of the command center is pretty awesome too we get a 4x4 wheeler and a crane and lots of room wow just wow great review great set you are well worthy of your custom title im gonna go buy this for only 90 woot	positive
splendid review i love everything on this set no question bout it somehow i knew i should have saved up and buy that when come to trubut the sight of turbocar chase and jetpack pursuit was to tempting to pass up	positive
wonderful review  one of the best ive ever seen on this site man we thought this might be the weakest set in the line but it turns out it may be the strongest everything about this set  from the color scheme to all the details to the minifigures to the piece selection  is just wonderful i think this set has finally confirmed it agents is everything alpha team wasnt and is how they should have done a spy theme from the start kudos to tlc for finally getting it right  and i sure hope theres a second year	positive
wow excellent review thanks that set sure looks fantastic its incredible how much features theyve managed to pack in while keeping it roomy im really impressed by the quality of the design tlc is sure getting back on track with great design ow 2008 is going to be expensive	positive
wowi cant believe i thought this line was falseoh crapsweet i need to get this	positive
i first i thought the whole agents line would not be very good but boy have i changed my mind this set looks amazing as do all of the other sets in the line i really like how the small vehicles all fit into the truck i dont like it when sets come with smaller vehicles and dont have anywhere to store them so they just float on the side that light projector is fantastic i cant believe they are actually printed this is definitly on my tobuy list thanks for the amazing review	positive
7645  mt61 crystal reaper piece count 600 price aud7995 4995 euros in most countries 3999 gbp usd 4999 its happened in the wider world and it had to happen to lego  yes the 80s are back space invaders holograms compulsory seatbelt wearing legislation and the return of classic space ok we dont have a fully fledged classic space theme back yet but if 7645 is the way of the future i think lego is ready to do it properly i wasnt a huge fan of last years mars mission sets and only picked up a few on clearance but this set is light years excuse the pun ahead of 2007s offerings this mining vehicle is solid compact and welldesigned it looks impressive and even better it has fantastic power functions operability behold 7645  mt61 crystal reaper ps i wasnt joking about the holograms or seat belts part 1 box instructions dsss dreaded sticker sheets parts front of box back of box 2 x instruction booklets dss numero uno  for the reaper dss number two  apologies for the blurry pic but i wanted to capture the sweet shimmy of the metallic holographic background on this sheet the way it catches the light really makes a difference to the small alien craft and makes it look much more interesting from the plain stickers of last year theres heaps of spare silvery stuff once the stickers are applied for those who use the leftover sticker material for customising parts bags  4 numbered with one extra with larger pieces parts everywhere  woo i know the lego instruction books scold me if i mix bags but im a devilmaycare kind of guy in your face tlc i love mixing all the parts together before i build it reminds me of my youth when the days were long anything was possible and i didnt need strict instructions not to build on grass or poke my eye out with a technic shooter interesting parts  these may or may not be new my technic knowledge is not that detailed the little scoop parts are so cute and have a heap of potential uses i love em theyre like smurf hats at miniland scale these technic wheel things in orange are also cute they kind of remind me of marigolds giant fabuland marigolds the track pieces  you get 70 of these  heres the section of track for one side  as you can see its about 52 studs long these hold together better than the small ones on the hailfire droid jungle cutter part 2 minifigs small mining transport alien ship i have to confess  i forgot to take an individual snap of the astronauts  its the usual bunch though  scaredy face guy sunglasses in space man and a third one i cant remember you dont really care though youre only interested in the alien commander and his matching arms legs combo deal as brickbitz noted in his review of the smaller set the glowy eye is just a 1x1 cylinder the set also comes with 2 normal jellies  one pictured here for size youll see what happened to the other one soon enough the alien craft is nothing exciting apart from the gorgeous glinting stickers heres the road safety angle the commander actually clips onto a 1x2 plate with handle so he cant fall out then the lime tentacle thing descends on top of him to keep him firmly there like a baby seat not very brave for an alien commander is he i mean did darth vader ever use a seatbelt tssk with cradle up this part of the build also includes the small astronaut mining buggy  small and effective please note in this build ive applied stickers to everything bar cockpit pieces this comes with radio and saw piece part 3 the reaper the first part of the build is the detachable shuttle i really like the retro aesthetic of this with the angled wings and the side hoverpod things it is much better than the comparable vehicle from 7699 the new flickfire piece is a waste of space  its fairly limp i prefer the simple flickfire technic pin to be honest theres also a very nice little side workshop as you can see i really like how the control unit is plugged into the wall via 5 1x1 round plates third pic its a bit dark great detail the technic pins on the back are there to connect the power functions battery box its odd theyre included at this stage of the instructions  maybe the intention was to release it originally with all the necessary motors etc but the price point was too high and they scaled it back the base the shuttle sits on that bley technic axle in the middle when the reaper is fully assembled the little vehicle scoots down the ramp at the rear which folds up to hold it in place when the reaper is in motion you can see theres a crystal container here as well  another nice small detail which i found the 2007 sets lacked theres also an alien here  thankfully not in those horrendous transorange tubes so prevalent last year the complete assembly isnt it snug its just the right size too  not massive but large enough to be a serious mining vehicle the ominous black treads contrast nicely with the white orange colour scheme of the vehicle itself the trans detailing  blue for weapons neon green for energy  is carried nicely through the whole set the blades and the scoops whirl nicely as the machine trundles along top down view tread detail whirling blades of death the buggy descends probably the most disturbing aspect of the whole set is this pic the jelly has an orange pump plugged into its heart which is connected to an energy supply on the left hand side this vehicle runs on alien jelly juice either that or its milking the jelly in some equally disturbing fashion how amoral is that i know theres been debate about this  the jellys arent innocent theyre evil energy crystal thieving maniacs etc  but i find it a bit odd that the humans respond by chaining the jelly up to the bowels of their mining vehcile and suck energy from its heart people debate about violence in lego as represented by realistic minifig weapons but i think the moral lesson here is even worse  its ok to exploit foreign life forms for our own gain if they treat us badly first whofans i think the ood should have a word with the jelly commander  that aside this set is welldesigned and fairly good value at aud7995 its definitely a notch above last years mars mission sets overall with improved detailing and more useful functions the holostickers are fab and its nice to have an alien commander even if he is a bit bulky and his fingers are identical to his toes however if all these reasons by themselves werent reason to recomend this set the following is part 4 power functions the best part of this set  and the reason i bought it really  is the integration of power functions bizarrely this isnt mentioned at all on the box and i only found out about it from the instructions when they were posted on eurobricks instructions for book 2 which has the power function stuff available here this is a great idea and hopefully we will see more new sets take this kind of approach especially with the new train sets luckily i got monster dino 4958 on sale for half price earlier this year so already had most of the necessary motors etc  the only one needed was an extra small one what you need is listed in the instructions below with redirections to shop  home to buy the motors note theres actually a mistake on this page the 2 small motors you need are both 8883 not 8882 which is the large xl motor way to confuse the kids there lego attaching them was a dream and only took a few minutes in contrast to 4958 where it was almost impossible to remove motor elements without dismantling the model basically the back platform and some plates and orange slopes come off you attach the motors and then the smaller plates go back on these parts are now left loose overall the look of the reaper isnt badly effected as youre mainly viewing from the front anyway sadly i cant show you how it moves youll just have to trust me that it does  the way it is steered is demonsrated in the instruction pages above basically each motor is controlled by a corresponding switch on the remote move them both forward to move forward move one right to turn right move both back to move back etc it zips along its a speedy little thing personally i wouldnt want to be in its path as it comes roaring down the martian canyon my cat was scared as it was it is oodles of fun and definitely worth trying if you have the motors or can get them cheaply and adds a whole new dimension to the play aspect of playset it is also as i said very quick to switch between modded and nonmodded reaper in contrast to the more fiddly dino creations the only problem i had is that if it moves too fast the weight of the battery box at the back tends to pull the whole thing back and it rears up it does correct itself though i only trialled this on carpet last night so it may behave differently on other surfaces  i will need to experiment part 5 summation this is a great set made even better with the addition of power functions at aud7995 its wellpriced buy it buy the motors as well kmart still has stock of 4958 at 89 wait for a 15 off sale you wont regret it buy 2 and make competing battle machines the only thing is just dont torture that poor jelly edited by sinner 24 june 2008  0325 am	positive
wonder full job but now my wallet aches in misery	positive
im not that into mars mission but this set reminds me of the jungle cutter	positive
great review i just got 7644 mx81 hypersonic operations aircraft its a great ship i started to review it but then it started to rain i was outside so the review is coming tommorow technicolor stickers very pretty	positive
you really are an awesome set reviewer sveltecorps thanks very much for this sweet review so indepth and detailed that is one sweet vehicle its got three of my favourite things treads orange and big slicey blades thanks again peace	positive
another great review im looking forward to getting this set sometime soon i wasnt aware of the power function aspect similar i suppose to the old technic sets which had an additional instructions for those with the relevant motors i knew those dinos i got at clearance would come in useful nice to see the recent bulldozer treads appearing in black grey seemed a slightly unusual colour choice	positive
these new sets are just totally offthewall radical d its the little details like the scoops on the blades and the alternate alien energy source lego didnt even have to include those but they did that show lego are really getting back into their groove this year the ability to add power functions is just so cool as well im going to pickup the creator monster dino set for the electronics when the sales hit as svelte has suggested a very entertaining review just like the agents mobile command center one d	positive
this set looks 10 times sweeter with the power functions too bad ill have to buy some extra	negative
wow this thing is very cool definately no lack of details and is quite cheap for the bang of the set that you get for some reason i really love the bay in the back of the detachable ship quite an improvement from last years line thank you for the review	positive
i was going to buy this set anyway but now im even more excited d my favorite part of this set is the bay that holds the little cart vehicles	positive
thank you for that fine review sveltecorps that´s a pretty cool set much more solid than the armoured drilling unit with a nice little transporter and some for sure pretty interesting additional power functions a very smart idea indeed did i miss something or is there really only one and probably improved shooting device and there´re even some levers to control the vehicles wow a matured marsmission on indeed now let´s get rid of these poor utilized jellies and we´re right on the way	positive
asuka on jun 4 2008 0926 am said did i miss something or is there really only one and probably improved shooting device no you didnt miss anything theres only one and its the less obtrusive new piece the range is pretty poor though 	neutral
iron moose on jun 4 2008 1128 am said so is there some way to get all those motor bits at once or do you have to buy them on their own i dont think ive ever seen them in a store here only from sh so far or if you buy sets which they come in all the ones you need apart from one additional small motor are available in the 4958 monster dino set which i got half price i ordered the extra from sh at the same time i bought the set  but only because i had already looked at the instructions and knew what i needed if people have the ferris wheel set as well i think the small motor comes in that	neutral
this should be reported to the news 	neutral
well i guess its nice that theyre making the story background a little more clear with that jelly plugged into the power cable hmmh both jellies and crystals can be used as power sources think theres a connection both of them are transparent and greenish maybe jellies hatch from crystals like eggs or need them as food or something important like that yay for evil humans	positive
excellent review loving this set i mean come on its a flipping tank awesomeness is written all over this  from all those blades and scoops at the front to the mini rover and yes you can even turn it into a motorized battle tank reminds me of the old technic days when they advertised in the manuals how to hook up the kits with separately sold motors another day another review of an awesome set yes this is sure tlcs year	positive
sveltecorps on jun 3 2008 1209 pm said the only thing is just dont torture that poor jelly i smell another dont hurt the dragonsjellies or something group nice reveiw i dont realy like the mm sets we want more starjusticespace skulls but this one looks ok i guess suprised they dont say that it has power functions on the box	positive

algernon on jun 5 2008 0203 pm said why is it that agents and star wars get their own news articles but this fantastic set is totally ignored i think maybe theres a bit of star wars excitement on the front page which has probably got a few members frothing with excitement not every review needs to be frontpaged anyway 	neutral
no but this is one of the most anticipated sets of 08	neutral
thanks for the review i really like all the mars mission sets this year the usage of the big wing is a bit annoying but you cant blame lego for reusing the mold ive been considering doing the same with mine mr mandalorian on jun 4 2008 0219 pm said so thats all folks shall i include one last bar joke i wouldnt have a bar of it	neutral
thanks for the great and very detailed review i love the new holostickers im still not sold on this set though im not sure why i think its the big wing piece and the tootechnicy build from looking at the instructions the platform seems kind of out of place and for the size of the set the functionality doesnt seem as good as it could be it reminds me of 7699 armored drilling unit  looks impressive but doesnt seem to do that much i do think mars mission has improved this year though bar none this is the weakest of the new mm sets i think	negative
mr mandalorian on jun 4 2008 0119 am said and then we have this thing what is it defense laser communications array satellite tv that certainly feels like an homage to the deep freeze defender which itself feels like an homage to the galaxy commander is there some way to centre one of the cockpit units without massive de and re construction	neutral
thanks for the review mr mandalorian the alien craft is a bit small in my opinion could have done with being just a little bit larger the main craft however despite its few minor flaws looks very good while space isn’t my normal theme i’m certainly being tempted this year	positive
iron moose on jun 4 2008 0234 am said that certainly feels like an homage to the deep freeze defender which itself feels like an homage to the galaxy commander thats the observation i had when i saw the first pictures of this set online a few months ago i am a proud owner of the 6973 deep freeze defender and 6980 galaxy commander so im looking forward to see how the 7644 stacks up next to them there is a definite lineage here and these sets clearly demonstrate the evolution of lego set design over the years the mx81 may not have the most playability out of all the new mm sets although it has alot from what i can tell but its hard to beat the look of a large sleek space cruiser sitting on your shelf or dresser at least for myself anyhow this is my first post to the forum and hope my welcome wont wear out here anytime soon edited by spacefan 04 june 2008  0643 pm	positive
spacefan on jun 4 2008 0556 pm said anyhow this is my first post to the forum and hope my welcome wont wear out here anytime soon having a name like that is a good start	positive
i dont understand why theres so much negativity this is actually my favorite of the new mm sets the finished look is very sleek and not very gappy at all the deployable landing pad is great and itll make it easy to put on a shelf without taking too much room lots of greebles although i will concede that its just begging to be modded still though im definitely buying this one  it has a really great look to it	positive
sinner on jun 4 2008 0344 am said having a name like that is a good start my screen name largely sums up my interest in lego but is not soley limited to space thanks for the warm welcome	neutral
two more questions 1  how stable is the entire craft when balanced on the platform is there a chance that it will just collapse 2  what are the total wingspan height and depth measurements of the model	neutral

great review mr boba fett i really like this set a lot some of the features may not be as good as i hoped they would but overall this looks to be a really nice set im so happy that the giant spacecrafts are finally back quote ive noticed a trend that the larger sets have plenty of parts potential but when assembled the model is not more than the sum of the parts eagle base certainly didnt seem worth the asking price at least this is one large model on a positive note the lame aero tubes darts and martian carrier pods have disappeared hm actually i dont see the comparison eagle base looked terible to me right from the start so it was no suprise when it ended up being the weakest kit in the first year this big ship on the other hand looked great as soon as i saw it and still looks good	positive
thanks for the review i actually quite like this i cant afford it so im not getting too attached to it but in its own way its great its certainly reminiscent of space sets of the past as others have said and the dropdown ramp section is just really cool as an idea you understand sure the lab is a little crap but at least the effort was made sort of  the sheer fact that its so big though really makes me like this theres just something appealing about large spaceships not capital ships just big space ships with lots of guns spacefan on jun 4 2008 1034 pm said anyway i hope were not breaking forum protocol by not discussing the 7644 review of the original poster or that particular set in general hey its no worse than batbrick and i no really it isnt even in the same league	positive
thank you for that nice review mr mandalorian wow somehow it´s almost like classic space´s back indeed it´s a great star ship it looks stream lined original and impressive and even the huge plane wing part looks rather cool and smooth on it it´s equipped at least with some kind of engines on top of the wings and although they´re made with only two a little juniorized parts it´s better than nothing there´s a lab or some sort of engine room with enough space inside to allow one or two mfs to play scotty yeah the two cockpits´re nicely detailed with a cool use of these orange 1x1 round plates and to detach one or all two of them reminds a lot of the playability of the good old space sets it seems even like it´s easy to attach them to some kind of cloud city twinpod car thanks these hinged wings looks like some solid fun to me of course the cockpits aren´t airtight and even this reminds unfortunately of the post blue grey and trans yellow era of cs anyway there´s no real fun without some moding i guess another great advantage of the set´s that it´s not overpacked with shooting things one technic shooter cool in grey and only one trans orange prison pod too well i can surely live with that especially since it´s nicely asymmetrical the drill rover´s very charming a little like a rebuilt oldsmobile convertibe stranded on mars sweet and that platform feature´s plain nifty and well done too very playable and useable for a lot of things hmm recently i complained a lot about the dense use of studless technic beams for the inner structure of vehicles like these exoforce tanks par exemple which makes moding in an economical way pretty frustrating but the beams here´re used in a very proper way it should be fairly easy to mod let´s say the back of that lab section up to perhaps even the cockpits to create a larger airtight area that could be boarded from the platform just to fit this certain spacers need for um realism there´re many more nice details too like that satelite tv thingy and that cylinder with trans blue 2x2 dish for the knob or these cylinders with cones on that handle and that alien craft´s pretty nice and detailed as well like i said before i really feel like classic space´s back	positive
hey thanks guys so you tolerated the bar jokes and faded lighting radiant7 on jun 3 2008 0901 pm said i appreciate your review mr mandalorian but why the negativity id try to find more positives about the set instead of kinda criticizing it after each picture i personally think it looks freakin awesome the size is very impresive and i nearly fell of my chair when i saw the first pics earlier this year its quite unlike anything ive ever seen from lego algernon on jun 4 2008 0634 am said i dont understand why theres so much negativity this is actually my favorite of the new mm sets the finished look is very sleek and not very gappy at all the deployable landing pad is great and itll make it easy to put on a shelf without taking too much room lots of greebles although i will concede that its just begging to be modded still though im definitely buying this one  it has a really great look to it spacefan on jun 4 2008 1038 am said i dont understand the negativity either one mans treasure is another mans trash i suppose that said having grown up with lego during the 80s this set has a certain nostalgia factor in its overall look and feel that harkens back to that earlier period in my life which i fondly remember aside from the factory star justice set elements of which i loathe i expect the 7644 to be the closest thing to a classic space revival that well ever see again from the lego group but i hope to be pleasantly suprised someday though im not living in the past and do appreciate everything lego is doing now and will do and has done since and like you im one whos definitely buying this set no matter how few of us there may be im sorry you guys thought i was being negative i actually love the set it brings a real feel of classic space to mm no im not talking in the third person  however it does have its own small issues which are nothing really i said that theres not much of a lab but thats the beauty of lego theres a lot of room in the ship so it should be a piece of cake to mod to a bigger lab too many bars ill take them off i really like the set i just want to change it to suit my tastes it looks beautiful it will find a home among my other mm sets as a favorite iron moose good question its about 17 inches wide 11 inches tall with ramp down and 16 inches wide as for the platform its pretty stable it tilts back a small degree so it doesnt collapse when tapped on the nose but i wouldnt leave it on the edge of a table while in that position	neutral
nice review just one little point since there is no sound transmission through space but there is an atmosphere on mars through which this this thing supposedly flies hypersonic airplane makes far more sense than hypersonic spacecraft 	positive
sorry mr mandalorian i guess i was just getting a bit defensive because when this set first appeared here there were literally 2 pages of people just bagging out the new mm sets but then the thread took a turn and people started to warm to them much like the agents i do agree that it definitely needs some mocing but with that work i think it has the potential to be a really amazing set in terms of what you could cram into it the lab is a little disappointing ive always wanted an enclosed cabin space in a vehicle this size because then all the little space guys can have a true meeting place the dropdown landing ramp is my favourite part it has lots of potential uses maybe its even possible to integrate pneumatics d	positive
hello shefols and afols as well as tfols welcome to eb news reviews i am your hostfor tonight anyway shadows will take over after this episode if we make more today we are reviewing mars impulse sets 5616 and 5617 starting with 5617 alien jet i must say it is a small and quick build the jellie is made of hard plastic which surprised me as i had expected jellies to be a soft plastic the jet is mainly 2x4 plates some swingy hinges the seatbelt and a thing which i cannot seem to name my one gripe about it is that the jelly cant see where he is flying it looks better with a mf in it there was a red 1x1 as a spare part we move on to the 5616 mini robot which is basically a safe brick with binoculars soem cheese slopes little arms and legs the best part i must say was the metal detector and safe brick as these seem to be quite rare in sets by my knowlage anyway the austronaut has a face shown in dr sinsters review the set also comes with a pickaxe and lime green gem extra peices where a cheese slope a green 1x1 and a white droid arm that concludes these minireviews i also will use this opportunity to show my photo setup both sets are reccomended if you either need a army or are just trying to get a variaty of figs like myself next weecamera fades edited by sinner 24 june 2008  0417 am	neutral

hello all eurobricks members i will be presenting my first review on one of the harry potters set firstly i must emphasize that i am not a very big harry potter fan or owned many harry potter sets for this review i will be highlighting what is the beauty of this small little set and the reasons to own multiple sets of it comments and critics are strongly welcomed this set is featured in the harry potter movie prisoner of azkaban this set is orignally released in 2004 align with the harry potters movie this was actually one of the movie scene where buckbeak the griffin is appeared in the movie the group of students are supposed to be having up close and personal with him however draco decided to disturb our lovely buckbeak enough of this movie synopsis i am sure fans of harry potter will know this better box art featured minifigcreature background scene the scene is a simple garden which had a very good mixture of spare parts for your mocs building on its own there is nothing outstanding about this set except for the griffin you can buy multiple sets for the griffin alone and for draco minifig well you dont need lots of draco but for castle lovers black cap are exceptionally useful at least from my view now i will point out the following why this sets is so great for other reasons hidden cover note that this is the only mechanism which you can find in this set it looks rather simple but quite useful there are some little things hide in it too greens foilage and brown parts needless to say much it offer 3 foilage a green plant 3 brown slopes 2 ideal bricks and 1x1 brown brick for building a tree great for jungle building forest building and etc i am sure there are many builders will look out for these interesting parts it comes with a wizard book owl 2 printed tiles with a spider and stone prints on it the far right seriously i dont find any good use for it can any eb members enlighten me on that gray thing on the right grey parts it comes with a good 10 x 4 green plate useful for adding as a platform some more grey slopes for your mocs there you have it draco encounter with buckbeak comparing with deep forest ambush as you may remembered recently there was an impulse set competition one of my entries which is under the history theme the deep forest ambush was firstly inspired by this set and made an improvement out of it look at the improved tree compared with the orignal summary review playability 410 not much to play with except swooshing around the griffin design 510 too simple and its defintely not related with the movie scene parts 1010 great for parts explained by the review a great deal of green and brown parts price 910 an inexpensive set based on the 2004 pricing overall 710 a must have for all harry potter fans and collectors whom needs a great use of green and brown parts hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine more pictures can be found in my brickshelf when moderated let the potter magic begans edited by whitefang 09 june 2008  0245 pm	neutral

mr spielbrick on jun 11 2008 0428 pm said ohhh great idea to review the old potter sets especially the line from prisoner of azkaban i was in my dark ages then luckily i was able to catch up on the missed figs with one internet order this draco is the best tlc has made if you ask me the new one also doubling for belloq and guards in the indy line doesnt look quite as hautain as this one buckbeak looks cool looks like his neckhead can be moved right rather similar to lego horses well designed the orange brick doesnt have a pumpkin face on it right unlike the one from philosophers stone in the set with the troll im looking forward to more reviews by you sir whitefang good work no printed face on the pumpkin since the event didnt happen on or near halloween unlike the whole troll situation i also agree that this draco is the best one the new one looks too much like a draco from the oldr films when he smirked a lot more but since very character got a redesignthey had to tune him up even if it meant changigng him for the worse	neutral
i bought about 5 or 6 of these sets when they were on sale in mid 2006 i still have a few of them laying around unopened i think i payed like under 5 for each and thats a great deal for all the variety of neat parts you get with this set	positive

hello eb yes im cranking out the reviews the other day i picked up this gem for an okay sales price at devonport tas while searching for the new batsets i informed iamded of this as he is a spideysuckup   and he informed me this was the only set he didnt have of the wave 2 of this theme so i ask you great eb members to please remind him of this when commenting here we go with the review of doctopus lair anyway unlike other reviews this stars more people the batbrickiamdeddragonatordaisy review daisy is the mouse that came in the set first up re the figs and i must say they are great i love fleshies and these are excellent to expand my batman world plus having a spiderman to beat up is good too doctopus is great though his tentacles are annoying to keep in order peter parker is a nice addition i love that torso eve though harry osborn was totally absent from this scene i welcome him as he is a good fig also best of all is mary jane fleshie females are hard to come by and i love that hair my very first one oh and even better is bley daisy on the far right another fantastic thing is that by mixing mj with doctopus you get a far more deadly and real villain than anyone couldve forseen  the hippy oh cmon tell me that aint cool anyhoo here is a pic of doctopus showing his might random fact did you know i influence both dragonator and iamded in their sigfigs dragonator adapts his from my ia series while iamded added mutt hair when i had him like that in a pic i posted now onto the box sorry about the lighting the art is good and the cartoon spidey in the corner may have beenthe inspiration for a similar style in the new batsets back of the box again sorry about the lighting and blur it was gtting late and these were the last pics finally we get to the first part of the set the catapult is that movie accurate or what i love the part in sm2 when he uses his homemade genetic spider powered catapult to launch himself to the scene oh well it does comes with a cool spider web an trans blue spider so it gets some points and it is really fun i launched spidey several metres once i dont think he ever recovered infact he almost certainly webbed himself slightly cooler extras are these two this awesome little boat is great for city as is the simple but nice bouy daisy approves naturally dragonator ruins everything when he found out the dragon that would be riding with him was our nickname for daisy now finally the main attraction  coctopus dock iamded and i threw dragonator in the water to see if he could swim he er couldnt one sweeney todd later we continue the overall construction of the building is very good i know a lot of people hated stickers and i hated applying these but they do look spectacular and perfect for any city setting like a bank a gotham bank as iamded has already noted below me the black lifesavers a very cool as are the web piece and log pieces the inside contains the neutron copperplate triple bypass humdrum holy hum 5000 which does does see movie anyhoo it is very cool and includes a little control thingy on the yellow brick next to it unfortunately the inside is plain but for that the other side has no wall too which is a bit of a letdown really but atleast it allows daisy easy access one gripe is those yellow 1x1 bricks they serve no purpose and break up the colour scheme better shot of the thingy thing i quite like it the use of technic parts actually works and the whole set is worth it for those purple flames and dishes alone it closes up pretty well too unable to hit the dish which is a nice feature me and iamded liked it so much we threw a revived dragonator into it unfortunately it disagreed with him but it was fun another shot of the dock i like how they have gaps in the jetty i know the movie version was pretty wack and although the set isnt very faithful to it looks more like a seaside library to be frank it still is very nice this is my first large blue baseplate too which is wonderful though funny how the set only uses about half of it the roof is a well designed and fun feature it uses some technic connections to render it flexible of any degree as you can see here by my opening of it better shot of the roof design it can lie flat or at any angle i might use the design myself in the future as much as i love the building this feature bugs me for in order for it to work this wall has to stick out which not only looks ugly but makes you be able to see through the corners still easily modded and log pieces are fantastic for mocing it also means that there are 7 windows all up for a good sizeable building by pulling out the piece in the center the walls both collapss sideways outwards which is actually pretty fun and works everytime overall view of the set including characters now for the story that makes no senseat all spiderman is dead after falling down the wall mechanism see above only daisy can save the day for dragonator is being held by the evil doctopus and iamded and dragonator are too busy not caring and brainbox is too busy complaining that this goes against all marvel continuity unfortunately daisy is on a lunchbreak so tough luck dragonator and daisy goes on a search for fortune and glory okay this is what i think of the set build 35  fun but those stickers ruin the experience somewhat and if you dont apply them the instructions are a bit hard to follow playability 45  great little gizmos and bits not the kind that keep you going like with the 2007 aquabase but good fun still design 45  not very movie faithful no but still a great little building and a smart design for certain aspects minifigs 55  great figs with all different faces and very useful bits price 25 far far overpriced even on sale sadly total 1825  a good set that couldve been better with a few minor changes nothing wrong with it but it doesnt really cross the line to greatness that said it has a lot going for it and definitely worth buying or atleast a look

great review batbrick i was curious as to what the interior of the building looked like i still think that there should have been a few random chains or something lying around as they may add to the abandoned feeling that the ware house had though i have to admit that i really like the roof dock and minifigs as some of them make good average civilians that are somewhat hard to come by in todays sets  great comic as well it seemed to add a lot to your review hope you can review another spider man set soon  btw as adam mentioned i believe you owe me a bar of soap for reading your review  edited by mack 14 june 2008  1259 am	neutral

brainbox on jun 14 2008 0714 am said thanks for the review even if it is a number of years late i picked this up whn it came out and thought it was a rather cool set besides the catapult plenty of cool pieces and the baseplate has found a use in the batcave although i think my dad managed to spill some beer on it at one point that was awful to clean off not late just delayed beer and i though playdoh was bad brainbox on jun 14 2008 0714 am said i wasnt expecting that there i was casually scrolling down when i stumbled onto a picture of me had to be done and it fitted your character didnt it adam on jun 14 2008 0740 am said where is my soap over there mack on jun 14 2008 1055 am said btw as adam mentioned i believe you owe me a bar of soap for reading your review  see above grevious on jun 15 2008 0330 am said great review the hippy and the story at the end were hilarious i think this was easily the best of the spiderman 2 sets youre right though  it wasnt movie acurate as the actual movie dock was far shabbier and more trashed than this ah well i guess tlc couldnt do everything thanks grevious it is a great set the hippy is awesome it was hard to take him apart iamded on jun 15 2008 0846 am said wait dragonators not caring that hes being held by doc ock what are you doing a very nice finish to the interview now i really want this set the story at the end was neat except for spidey dieing  but my favourite part was the exploding dragonator nothing personal mate it just looks cool when people are thrown into fusion reactors yes i agree exploding dragonators are always hilarious maybe i should pm him that pic as for dragonator not caring it was late and i was getting careless batbrick away	positive

hi everyone please note that this review was done back in 2006 so do forgive me if you happened to notice any dated comments product 6205 vwing theme star wars no of pieces 118 release date feburary 2006 rrp sgd2990usd990 availability lego shophome target toys r us us  europe bricksworld sg legocom said rule the spaceways the sleek vwing fighter can adapt to any situation position the wings and flaps in attack mode to protect palpatines shuttle from enemies or position the wings in flight mode to survey the area for intruders either way the vwing is ready to strike for the republic includes clone pilot and r4 droid position wings in attack or flight mode sorry to all for the delay since this was supposed to be done 3 days ago anyway to get on with it quite a minimal amount of baggies for this set as noticed and the best thing is no sticker sheet yippee bounce the completed vwing though not really a complaint it would be nice if the entire astromech body was provided instead of only the head dome p of course then it wouldnt be movieaccurate since the q7 series astromech is integrated with the starfighter lol hes definitely wellpainted for a simple minifig since even the back is painted too i have to assumed this is the same minifig provided for 7259 arc170 starfighter too since i dont have that set anyway this minifig is much more accurate for this vwing since his suit is rated against vacuum while those in the arc170 arent  p one thing thats lacking is the instruments panel in the cockpit its totally nonexistent here i wonder what went wrong during the design stage personally this is the second most anticipated set for 2006 the first being the tie interceptor for me one thing is that theres no known release of the vwing starfighter by hasbro nor the other wellknown brands the other thing is that being a star wars vehicle collector i would really loved to see a replica toy of the vwing and the vwing by the lego group does not disappoint its nearly movieaccurate except for the cockpit transparisteel cover which could used some paint like the xwings also theres a permanent landing gear that quite neat since it allows you to land the craft on uniform surfaces the sfoils on the other hand can be quite a pain to pose into flight position very difficult for the sfoils to remain symmetrical during play the swooshable or play factor of this product is quite good just check out the pics for yourself d crackle general skywalker we have incoming to conclude the vwing starfighter would make a much better companion to the eta2 actis interceptor jedi starfighter than the arc170 coz the arc170 seems more like a longrange bomber to me than a snubfighter p and a final pic to show it at rest comments for 2008 just an updated pic to show my latest display on the clone wars hmm off the record i do understand that sometimes reviews by most tend to a certain set of guidelines like naming the set and showing the boxed and out of boxed pics and of course the grading portion regarding my review i prefer not to grade any of the lego sets at all as far as possible because to each hisher own my reasons to put up a review is not to belittle the efforts of tlg in coming out with these products nor to help them market them but to show my appreciation and enjoyment of these products i hope noone is offended by this and would like to apologise for any misunderstanding that this may caused for those who do not understand the above paragraph care not for it and play on like me	positive

i picked up this set mainly because of the many 5spare glow in the dark parts and the promise of 2 racers and one helicopter for the price of a little more than two racers 90kr vs 2x40kr the box the back of the box shows the two alternate models you can build if the polybags rip there are 3 cheese slopes and two 1x2 tiles that glow in the dark where the tiles are exclusive for this set the total parts count is high at 142 but there are no really big pieces among them inside the box you will find the building instructions a sheet with some odd sticky labels thrown away and 3 polybags marked by the bag building difficulty the models the lime colored car doesnt bring out anything new we have seen racers built like that before but it does contain some nice bricks for the collection the police cruiser surprises with an interesting design along the sides as seen here it is harder to build because of the greater level of details the helicopter is without doubt the hardest vehicle to build in a bag i cant finish it because its larger than the bag you cant put on the top blades nor the tail of the thing so it beats the forklift from 7733 where the top bar is the new kind that doesnt completely fit there is also instructions for the alternate models but it requires the bags to be opened the vehicles are pretty standard for the racers theme with the police car being the highlight of the set conclusion i like the difficulty curve between bag 1 and 2 but the last bag should be labeled 1000000 instead of 3 it requires some inhuman skills to build that helicopter in the bag  lime colored car 3  we have seen it before but it has some nice pieces and lime police cruiser 9  it has a massive diffusers rare parts and a high level of details it is a shame lego relies so much on stickers helicopter 6  if you see it as a set for one fourth of the price of the cars it is quite amazing but you cant bag build it and i would personally prefer some more detail instead of the big size overall it is a nice little set but the police car is the main attraction i wouldnt get the other vehicles if they were sold separately brickshelf gallery edited by whitefang 23 may 2009  0703 pm indexed	negative

nice review but i think bag building is a boring way to build	neutral
seeming as there were no reviews of this set in the index i have uploaded mine from jabbas hutt  here is my review for lego set 10178 motorized walking atat because i live in the uk i got this set with 6 free duracell batteries which was great its just twice as expensive as the us heres the basic set that is from the instructions this is the cockpit but please note after i took this photo i realised it was slightly built wrong heres one of the feet in proportion to a minifig to give you a general size this is luke skywalker swinging on a wire trying to destroy the atat i really wish lego didnt make so many lukes because i want differnt minifigs it would also be nice for a thermal detonator piece underneath the atat you can see the shaft that moves the back legs the motor and squeezed in on the righ t the massive battery box a load of cogs that move the legs these are the included figures snowtrooper general maximilian veers atat driverpilot or whatever you want to call him and luke all whithout there wepons please note veers should have a dark stone snowtroooper torso with 4 red and blue badge things not 3 these are the figures with weapons i gave them and the included ones snowtrooper has new style blaster veers has standard light grey pistol like the ones from the old adventure sets atat driver has old style blaster which i call heavy blaster and luke has shiny handle blue light sabre  the shiny blue light sabre was included with the set which is a bonus because i really dont like the grey ones httpwwwbrickshelsc00521jpgjpg this is the switch which is attached to the battery box on either side of the atat underneath the lift up side panels you push the forward to walk forward and backward to walk backwards simple eh  a front veiw with the the panels open here are the drivers controls which are simply a cotrol panel and 2 exoforce robot hands which are joystick things seen in the film if you look closley the almost useless carry handle this is the weird back piece looking down the atat from the back where you can see the the battery box and switch troops decending from ropes and cables and vader leading the assult for this i hadnt got any more imps so i used clones pilots i now have a whole load more snowtroopers solo and chewie sabotaging more troops to squash rebel scum huzahh a very bad picture of everyone packed up inside the size incomparison to its predecessor overall i would give this set 910 because it should come with more snowtroopers or it could be and endor version with loads of strormies and scout troopers aswell as this you can really sit any one down because of the battery box but i stilll find space to put all the shown figures on this review in the interior as you can see on the above image the chains and ropes are hanging down a bit tjis set is now limited to 5 per customer in the uk and now no longer comes with free batteries the walking on this is a bit wonky and dosent really walk like they do in the film as it moves two legs at a time i am currently attaching a motor to the head to make it move independently	negative
nice review i have the original atat and i like it a lot considered buying this one but it being motorized made me not also i think a set this size could really come with some more snowies benny	negative
kimt on jun 19 2008 0342 pm said great review indexing it as i write this how come you think the ctt is the atats predecessor do you mean the motorized atat or atats in general i think this is a great set and i am very fond of mine its one of the few sw sets of mine that is on parade at all times most are packed away in the attic kimt btw its not alone the older version of the atat is keeping it company the body looks exactly like it	neutral
i mean by the clone turbo tank turned into the atat i think in the films when they changed all there technology and vehicles when they became the empire	neutral
as far as i know the atat was a invention by general veers himself benny	neutral
nice job with this review skipper	neutral
nice review i echo the sentiment that more snowies would have been better	negative
vadersson on jun 19 2008 0157 pm said as far as i know the atat was a invention by general veers himself benny i doubt that the atat was used in the clone wars	neutral
smithboy on jun 20 2008 0601 pm said i doubt that the atat was used in the clone wars well you never know maby veers was around then just because it was used in the clone wars dosent mean that veers didnt design it to wookiepedia	neutral
vader had a red pole because i think it makes him look bigger and in the films i doubt it is but i think his saber might be bigger	neutral
i never got the set it looked way to skinny i came close to buying it for the figs but then decided not to if you compared this one to the later one there is a big difference this one just didnt seem proporshined with the legs and its body	negative
thank you for the review skipper i never got this set because it was too expensive and motorized it completley reminded me of the old robotic toys called zoids or maybe even gundum at least the figs are great a chrome lightsabe hilt for luke ecxellent and the pilot is cool too and another snowie doesnt hurt and i didnt even know about the commander guy whatever you call him so people could have made a custom ds this whole time thanks again	positive
this is one of those sets that you just have to have i mean a motorised atat is a dream set for original trilogy fans and has an awesome set of minifigures	positive
thanks for the review kimt  it comes at a confusing time you can take off the top disk and lift it like the millennium falcon from the top now i actually dont like this set that much it takes about 5 hours and 15 minutes to build if you do it in one go but the repeating sections makes this built the most tedious i have experienced it has way too many holes from which you can see the colorful skeleton and is overpriced compared to the older 10030 isd i remember thinking it was too expensive when it was 50 off at sh even the snowspeeder was kewler to less than half the price	negative
thanks for the review eh honestly i though this was awful ever since i first saw the pictures to me an incomplete grey ball doesnt really work as a special ucs kit for the sole reason that its boring extremely so now the new death star playset is a whole different story they should have done that in the first place edited by grevious 24 june 2008  0912 pm	negative
even though i never liked ucs i absolutley hate this one sure its great on display but the build looks extremley boring to me just stacking plate after plate and as you said its going to break a little if you touch it the only intersting part for me is the firing laser although i do have to say the proce isnt too bad i still wouldt buy it and no minifigs so thanks for the review but ill pass on this one the new minifig scale ds looks awesome though and this might have hyped some up who are buying the new ds	negative
great review kimt  i like this set even if i don´t own it because it looks simple fantastic to display i just have one question the mini executor can be moved around the death star ii or its attached to that place thanks for the review 	positive
good job kimt it´s a really nice set it will be interesting to see the size of ds2 ucs compared with the new death star playset keep up the great regulator job you are doing morten	positive
darkrebellion on jun 25 2008 1239 am said great review kimt  i like this set even if i don´t own it because it looks simple fantastic to display i just have one question the mini executor can be moved around the death star ii or its attached to that place thanks for the review  its attached to the ds and cannot move as such though there is 4 spots where it can be attached to the ds reading your comments on this set i can see why tlg has been forced to put it on sale on the us sh i dont agree that the isd is better  imho theyre exactly them same  big and grey this is a question of personal liking  which is the coolest ds or isd not comparative id still call this an ok ucs when looking at it individually but there sure is a lot other ucs sets that would get a better score than 510 kimt	positive
mortensonne on jun 25 2008 0336 am said it will be interesting to see the size of ds2 ucs compared with the new death star playset i was thinking about the same as for the review  thanks	positive
great concise review kimt though its not for me you held my interest all the way through thanks isc	positive
i also dont feel this is a very good set but is that old grey in which case it would be a nice part pack dr brick	negative
thanks for the review kimt honestly like the others have said i dont find any appeal in ucs sets especially this one its just a big incomplete grey ball	negative
the build was a bit boring and i suppose a big grey ball isnt all that interesting but since the death star ii in the movie is a big grey ball too i dont see the problem i didnt think it was particularly fragile i dont care about minifigs or playability either a few plusses in my opinion it looked pretty damn impressive sitting in my lego room and the construction is really clever all in all i actually liked this one but perhaps i have a different expectation of sets than most of you sets are mainly parts packs and would you look at the quantity of grey plate in this thing its new grey btw i paid half price for it at shophome uk which is still a lot more than half price from the us and i didnt regret it for a second cheers ralph	negative
lasse d on jun 25 2008 0604 pm said here are some advantages that makes isd win for me  a lot more fun to build with less repetitions  it is easier to build alternate models from it how many alternate models of the ds2 have you seen  the bricks are more varied  you get magnets  it is a larger set if you look at the size  its more intresting to look at  its got more variety of nooks and crannys	positive
wow what a letdown i recently picked up this set and i looked up this review to see what i was getting into not good news the silver lining is that it was a damaged box deal at brickworld so it only cost me 100 half off the already lowered price so it was definatley worth it as a parts pack if nothing else its the last unopenedunbuilt large kit in my collection so even if it is repetetive i am going to build it anyway it is likely however that i may substitute pieces to do away with the colored interior ive already determined that after it sits on display for a while i want to do a zepplin as an alternate build looking at the parts list it looks like its the perfect set for such an undertaking	negative
kimt on jun 24 2008 0322 pm said 4 zero swooshability i think its very swooshable assuming you swoosh it at the same speed it moves in the movie d while i would never do something like this i bet if you packed this sucker with a bunch of m80 firecrackers it would make for a fantastic end to a stop motion movie with it being as delicate as you say it is i bet you wouldnt destroy any parts edited by gotoandlego 03 april 2010  0257 pm	positive
dang so much negativity on a such spectacular set this baby provides an amazing backdrop to any lego inspired star wars diorama and lets face it lego tends to be a rectangular brick and somehow we now have a sphere guys its a ucs it accurately depicts the on screen icon and put plain and simple is a wonderful sculptural piece of work in its own right i agree with kimt in that the removal of the laser and super star destroyer gives it more authenticity but to call it a gray golf ball or ignore its inherent accuracy is simply to miss the point it proved to be the best build to share with someone be it family or friend due to its repeated sections and impressive finish its a clever build and to criticize it for lack of playability or i suspect for many its absence of minifigs is just absurd and possibly why lego has not released a proper ucs in nearly two years i reckon many out there would love a ucs tyderium imperial walker or slave 1 with a spectacular piece count be it minifig scale or just darn impressive in its own right sadly for those who love these sculptural masterpieces were stuck with simple toys with play features and cute minifigs clever in their own right but lacking the clout and purity of the old ucs line lets hope some diversity of product is just around the corner else 10179 was the last of the truly brave financial gambles of the star wars line	positive
i decided to reread this review because i just got this set today i dont really have a concern over the design or repeating build process because owning this set was never an option for me as i collect ucs sets but i am surprised to see an almost total lack of positive posts i really hope that i enjoy this build	neutral

i bricklinked it too back in the day it was an interesting build  just thought building the unfinished hemisphere was kind of tedious	negative
ive just ordered the bits for this from bricklink im awaiting the final order now so im interested in these comments i can see that since ill be building it with the kids ill have to plan in plenty of breaks and do lots of parallel building to keep us all from getting bored	positive
very nice review jim i havent bought this set yet but am planning to just to get a gg fig as i dont have one already bought an imperial landing craft instead this week as it was on sale but after this review ggs fighter is sure to follow soon benny	neutral
hey thanks for all the feedback guys ill try to do the sith infiltrator this weekend	neutral
does the sliding cockpit come off easily my friends brothers breaks everytime you touch it but he may have built it wrong it put me off the set	negative
nice review i bought a couple of these for parts the only thing i dont like about the ship itself not the lego version it does fine is why is the grand droid general flying around in in a small fighter like this i prefer the battlefront interpretation witch uses it as a bomber anyway great review york	neutral
thanks again you guys dont worry the sith infiltrator review will be up this week my computer has viruses but now i got firefox complete with spell check so i should be able to go on the internet ok from now on	neutral
great review i would get the set but im saving for the clone wars sets	positive
great set great review i have it too and i am very glad to own it it will probably be the cheapest and best way to get a grievous fig for a while even though it doesnt come with a cape  you guys know that you can use the new robotskeleton arms from the castle sets to make him hold his lightsabers horizontically right i always have him with two of each kind of arm	positive
hello all eurobricks members i will be doing the second wave of the 2008 impulse set series which had released recently i bought this set earlier ago and will like to share this comprehensive review with everyone of you name troll warrior theme lego system  castle year 2008 pieces 19 minifigs 1 an image of a 5618 troll warrior let the march begin the mighty brave troll warrior carrying a dangerous cart equipped with a flick fire missile marching into the lands of the crown kingdom crown knights must be ready for this new troll addition from what i see this set has a very minimum piece count since its an impulse set there is no unique parts found in this set however this set has a couple of useful accessories such as 2 spears and 2 wooden wheels and a grey mouse running around this set is another alternative for castle army builders to buy multiple sets to build a massive troll armies in addition the flick missile really works use a little bit of force from your finger and flick it the missile will fly well it certainly does not impress me at all with such playing feature base of the cart different angles there is one thing i dislike about this set the wooden wheels are too big and it is the same as the ones in the crossbow attack i prefer the smaller wheels that exist in old castle sets that produced smaller cart since this cart size is similar to the old cart size the old wizards cart is a very good example of the proposed wheel bits and pieces closeup on the warrior and the mouse summary review playability 5510 the playability feature is not fanastic design 6510 design is adequate if the wheels is much smaller and the flicking thing disappear the score will be much higher price 810 an inexpensive set to get a troll warrior and a mouse overall 610 to conclude this set is good only for army builders a new range of millitary vehicle to be added thats all hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine comments and critics are strongly welcomed pictures can be found in my brickshelf when moderated edited by kimt 10 august 2008  0129 pm	positive
its all good buti know you expected a but  its a rat	positive
thanks for the review bearing in mind that the whole point of this set is to get a cheap troll warrior i actually quite like it the cart isnt brilliant but for 13 pieces its not that bad the troll fig is great as always and i guess the rats are always nice to get not so much in real life though the sets that contain the trolls have a fairly solid number each i mean tower raid has three but nevertheless i think i may have to pick up a few of these whitefang on jul 2 2008 0249 pm said in addition the flick missile really works use a little bit of force from your finger and flick it the missile will fly well it certainly does not impress me at all with such playing feature the trolls hands are going to get quite sore then arent they	positive
trooperdavinfelth on jul 2 2008 0315 pm said its all good buti know you expected a but  its a rat or maybe a very large mouse	neutral
its a good review but you forgot another thing the troll needs a shiled like they used to in the 2007 castle line the sets always had shields for the minifigs and it could be better if it was 300 instead of 350 but yes it is a good impulse great army builder	positive
a more affordable troll warrior for those of us avoiding the large sets me is always nice thanks for the review god bless nathan	positive
very good nice to see how its all played out nice review	positive
ah sweet thanks for the review whitefang i hope this set shows up in nz soon i cant wait to get my hands on it troll warrior on peace	positive
quote in addition the flick missile really works use a little bit of force from your finger and flick it the missile will fly well it certainly does not impress me at all with such playing feature something to toughen up kids fingers thanks for the review cant wait til i get this comes to oz	positive
whitefang on jul 3 2008 0406 am said now will there will be a dwarf impulse set in the future i supposed that will be much interesting i certainly hope so i only have one hollisbrick on jul 3 2008 1025 am said thanks for the review cant wait til i get this comes to oz hey im still waiting for somewhere in the uk other than tlc itself to get the first wave of impulse sets	neutral
whitefang on jul 3 2008 0406 am said i thought by calling it as a mouse it will be a little much friendly unlike calling it a rat why is mouse friendlier than rat	neutral
guys thanks for your kind comments it seemed most of us here love this impulse set mainly to build army guess i am a little bit too critic in my review i was expecting a little bit more nevertheless i intend to buy multiple sets of this and build on my orc armies and split them into different battalions this is indeed one of the better ways to acquire orcs wilhelm screamer on jul 3 2008 1130 am said i got two of these in the mail today and was so eager to do a review of it thanks for saving me the work opps i was eager to do a review as well when i bought these sets i hope you enjoyed reading this comprehensive review nikola bathory on jul 3 2008 0408 pm said hey your review is great as usual as for the set itself  well its an impulse set after all  small and cheap nothing special well the rat is special hehe for me the rat is the most interesting in the set cause i dont have a rat i dont have a troll warrior either but im not very interested give the new theme a chance i feel tlg have made an effort to revive certain elements that are present in past castle themes although it is not as good as the past but it is certainly better than the recent castle themes shoc on jul 4 2008 0100 am said why is mouse friendlier than rat well mouse sounded more friendly because it can associate with tom and jerry but calling it a rat equal calling it a pest its just a matter of putting it in different terms thats all edit instead of posting another post to explain why i used mouse i will write it here tom and jerry is reflected as a cartoon children associate jerry as a mouse since its supposed to be heartwarming and make us laugh in real life there are many different pets we raised one of the possible pets we considered is a mouse mouse are supposed to be shy and friendly creatures that live in harmony while rats lived in packs hunt food in the dark and is widely regarded as a pest in this review i am trying to illustrate rat and associate it with mouse by presenting it in a much friendly approach there is no right or wrong answer its just making use of different words to represent how i feel towards a particular thing edited by whitefang 04 july 2008  0808 am	positive
this is a nice way of building up orc armies but i do wish it was designed like the knight impulse set there you have a minifig enough weapons and armor for two figs and a weapons rack made out of basic pieces add a generic fig from your collection and you have two knights and the pieces from the rack can be easily used in mocs the pieces that make up the siege weapon in the orc impulse are not as easy to use in other creations id rather have seen a orcish weapons rack different from the knights rack but like it using basic elements with a second helmet another weapon the orc armor and a shield to put on it still although not as good as the knight impulse its a nice little set whitefang on jul 4 2008 0343 am said tom and jerry is reflected as a cartoon children associate jerry as a mouse since its supposed to be heartwarming and make us laugh in real life there are many different pets we raised one of the possible pets we considered is a mouse mouse are supposed to be shy and friendly creatures that live in harmony while rats lived in packs hunt food in the dark and is widely regarded as a pest where i come from people keep both as pets however if either are found in the house uninvited they are considered pests and if you look at the chinese zodiac rats are very well thought of and are symbols of prosperity the brick mouse rat	positive
thank you for the review the set is nice i didnt need the flickfire missiles and would have rather a orctrol shield instead but i think i will pick one up	positive
glad you guys like the review brainbox on jul 3 2008 0619 pm said looking at this is making me want to build one of the favourite sets of my childhood 6649 street sweeper might do that today actually cheap good pieces despite the lack of a bin lid thats just inviting disaster isnt it nice fig and one of those blue brushes which ive always loved but never managed to use the 6649 looks lovely and i hope you managed to restore it indeed a bin without a lid is inviting trouble	positive
thank you for the nice review this set looks good i have too many of the blue sweepthings but the fig is nice and i didnt have this face so i will pick up one some day	positive
thanks for the review poor little minifig this guy has to haul the heavy machine all the way from the depot onto the littered streets to locate some trash but when he has finally found some and switches on the machine everything will be launched towards his pants no wonder hes looking sad a nice set though and inventive too when it comes to streetsweepers i remember getting the first of its kind on my birthday in 1991	positive
thanks for doing these impulse sets whitefang this set looks like it has a good number of useful parts i dont have the minifig torso or head nor the oar or the life jacket	positive
whitefang on jul 3 2008 0318 am said this set is simply wonderful you know thats exactly what i thought i love it its simple well designed and cute there are some nice pieces in there as well and i really do quite like the fig the new coastguard torso looks great thanks	positive
excellent review i like how the new coast guard sets blare out new when you see them	positive
thank you for the nice review the set is nice the pieces are nice and the grey helmet is great for an additional star wars rebel technician	positive
i really enjoyed your review of the kayak so many little things in one set that arent currently in my collection i didnt even realise it came with a buoy cool helmet lifejacket face and oar i will definitely need one of these cheers isc	positive
hello all eurobricks members this will be my last impulse set review for the second wave hope everyone of you will find my reviews useful and helpful in your purchase name crystal hawk theme lego system  mars mission year 2008 pieces 26 minifigs 1 an image of a 5619 crystal hawk alpha 3 in sector 5 reporting to base alpha 3 crystal hawk reporting for duty sir may i present mars mission latest scout craft code named crystal hawk this spacecraft looks very sleek and cool with its usual white and orange color combination i am not a fan of mars mission but these white minifigs simply attracted me for it in fact i only owned its impulse sets and none of its main sets nevertheless this set has the swoosh factor i was swooshing around in my home last night well i am not swooshing it like kimt though am i seeing double haha the answer is no it has double sided face i combined the pictures to illustrate the two facial expressions bits and pieces different angles love the way how the wings bend upwards and downwards the only thing i find it a little bit wierd for spacecraft normally i thought joystick is the typical navigation controls for a spacecraft instead of a steering wheel i am not complaining about a steering wheel in a spacecraft to me its quite an uncommon sight anyway the white steering wheel is an useful part for making vehicles mocs summary review playability 810 fun to play with when you bend the wings up and down design 8510 design is simple but creates a sleek and cool look price 810 an inexpensive set to get more scout craft and mars mission minifigs overall 8510 a very good set to have for any mars mission fans and for collectors like me whom cant afford all mars mission sets this set is a very great alternative hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine comments and critics are strongly welcomed pictures can be found in my brickshelf when moderated	positive
one of the better impulse sets imo	positive
glad you enjoyed viewing the review xenologer on jul 3 2008 0112 pm said the hawk it seems to me lacks a cockpit theres not even a seat to keep the pilot from falling off perhaps it theyd redesigned it to be a backpack jetpack sort of unit using similar pieces itd at least make some sense these are some of the improvements which we can do it ourselves to mod it better i think these are great suggestions otherwise we can add in a white air tank to be included onto the minifig xenologer on jul 3 2008 0112 pm said based on the other mm impluses can we assume this goes for 35usd at that price it seems to me that the astro fighter at 5usd was already a superior impluse set guess id buy one on clearance for the minifig in sh crystal hawk is priced at usd 350 i bought mine at a much expensive price when you compared it with usd i never bought the astro fighter i am supposed that it comes with a little bit more parts and an additional alien fig with it	neutral
thanks for another review whitefang this is quite a nice set actually it evokes some of the design elements of the mx11 while looking different enough to justify me buying it the head on the astronaut is one i like so even better i hadnt realised it was that one actually does 26 pieces make it one of the bigger impulses sets i think i may have to get one if not two plus its called crystal hawk how can that not be considered cool	positive
nice review good little set probable one of the only impusle sets i will be geting untillif they make agents theme impulse sets and i like the neat doublesided face edited by darthlegois619 03 july 2008  1035 am	positive
i really like the look of this impulse set even though i sold off my mm sets to buy sw i kept my astro fighter and this impulse set really appealed from the moment i laid eyes on it i feel the swooshability and cool extras like the double sided face far outweigh the lack of cockpit thanks for another great review whitefang	positive
i like this one aswell it has a couple of parts i need for an moc train locomotive and i dont have any of those space guys yet and a double faced guy is always a winner in my book	positive
once again another outstanding review by sveltecorps i am not a very big fan of agents but this theme defintely offer plenty of useful parts this volcano base is simply fanastic for parts usage especially in doing up landscaping with mountains by making use of the brown burps i must admit that the exterior looks real cool but the interior looks rather empty these orange slopes certainly make a great illustration of the larva which gives the agents a hard time to infiltrate within its compound to save his comrade i am quite sure this set will defintely attracts lots of kids to coax their parents to buy it since the bright colors will defintely caught their attention with all those hitech sleek weaponary i am sure this is the next big thing for kids out there well i am not sure if this theme works for me as well but this set defintely works well for landscaping project	positive
thanks for another great review i definitely like this set sure the interior might be a bit bare but i think that the outside of the base with all of the great lava and rocks more than makes up for it it is a bit weird that on the one side there is nothing on the inside but thats easy to fix anyone know when this will be out in the us thanks again for the fantastic review	positive
droool must buy to sveltecorps how on this wonderful planet did you get that i thought it was coming in september	positive

ah great review i have always wanted this set since it came out but with the price i think i will get the mobile command center first this will need serious interior mods like i did with my dino attack chopperpics soon	neutral

this will be a wonderful set for a mustafar moc	positive
cool set i got that firearm thing straight away lol i might get a few of these sets and combine into mustafar great review	positive
i didnt exactly know where this belongs the best but i think it fits the best in here cause its somewhat space related i got this nifty little set yesterday from an auction ebay new and sealed i think the rock raiders theme was a great theme and i wish they would have continues id back then but anyway lets see what we got here set nr 4910 name hover scout number of minifigs 1 number of pieces 39 release year 1999 first a picture of the little box  instructions a general overview of the set and here we have the lovely  miss jet yes the minifigures had odfficial names in this theme  the little vehicle and finally the crystal analysis station i like that very much even if its simple but it does a good job and the amount of equipment also is cool thats it little set little review but big fun i can recommend that to everybody its great for the parts and the minifig is lovely gets a 1010 from me	positive
omg iamdeds torso  spoiler oh my god spoiler	positive
excuse me butwhat	neutral
when i got this set my first rock raiders set i thought it was the best set i ever had maybe that was a little bit of an overstatement but i like a lot the pieces mainly and this is a nice little review are92 rowar on jul 10 2008 0822 pm said omg iamdeds torso  spoiler oh my god spoiler what would be more appropriate is commenting on iamdeds torso saying omg jets torso	positive
woo rock raiders only the best theme ever thats right possibly even better than castle 07 cheers for the review metalandi hopefully you can inspire others to see the greatness of rock raiders too i love how everything was so simple yet so effective it was loads of fun to play with and build the alternate models when i was younger as well and probably still is  do you plan of doing any other reviews or do you have any other sets rapid rider is another great small one adding a bit of diversity with a waterbased vehicle and you get the bandit minifig or you could get the rock raiders set and get all of our spelunking friends dont make me name them all  or if you want a slightly bigger set loader dozer could be the way to go axles a pretty cool minifig too and you get a rock monster sorry if the last comments were detracting from your review dont think i didnt like it becuase it was great i really hope you can do more oh and yes my torso does come from a female fig peace	positive
unfortunately i dont have any other sets yet i think i got one of the bigger vehicles back in the time but i dont have any sets from this time anymore but i certainly plan to get the loader dozer andor the chrome crusher soon i found an ebay auction where somebody is selling the sets 4940 4950 and 4970 new  sealed hopefully i have luck with that its only at 4 euros right now but its still running 6 days httpcgiebaydewtaitih005	neutral
great review  man this brings me back i still have like 5 of those rock monsters in response to your statement rock raiders does belong in this forum being everything space related 1 its on an alien planet 2 in the computer games start and in the story yes there was a computer gamemy cousin has it they are in a space ship 3 there are huge alien rock monsters trying to kill them	positive
rock raiders was one of my favorite lego themes ever	positive
sinner on jul 20 2008 0456 pm said i consider rock raiders space too i also consider many of the diver themes space as well me too the rock raiders are very scifi with the best lego space storyline the aquazonies would be inner space rather than outer space though but they look very spacey edited by shoc 20 july 2008  0745 pm	neutral
this set looks like a dandy is the darth maul fig any different in respect to the torso or head design to the original	neutral
ill be honest  i dont like this ship at all its one of my least favourite ships in the pt and i have to yet buy either one of those sets i also found it funny that this set was meant to be a walmart exclusive yet never appeared on the shelves at my walmart anyhow thanks for the review	negative
nice review jim i think i would only buy this for darth maul though you definitely showcased all the cool features really well	neutral
i got this set last year and i think you made a mistake when you have remove a piece to access the probe droids and equipment you just have to slide the entire main part and i have a question is this equipped with the new flickfire missiles that dont fall off	neutral

nice review rezourceman i wanted to see one of this set it seems there isnt much to it other than what it looks like in the official pictures but i may well get it i like slime face	neutral
great review rezourceman your pics really show off the sub well and its good to see the build in progress i also have this set but i didnt apply stickers to the sub as i was planning to reuse the nice dark blue pieces however as shown in your review they do brighten it up a fair bit i cant say this is my favourite agents set the boat is a little oddly proportioned and the sub although retro looking has practically no interior and would be difficult to customise to put more in unlike say the clever job batbrick did with the penguin sub in his review the sub kind of looks like some jules verneish sea creature  i would have liked it if theyd gone all the way and made it some kind of giant robot jellyfish or squid i do agree with you about slime face  he has a fantastic torso with all the slime dripping down which is a bit obscured by the air tank its really encouraging that in the last 2 missions weve had great extra villains added in the only thing i would add about the octopus is that the glow in the dark plastic is mixed in unevenly with the aqua blue so it doesnt glow in the dark evenly  its kind of like the mars mission jellies in that respect though much cooler thanks again for the great review	negative
darthlegois on jul 11 2008 1028 am said color0000ff coughalphateamcough id forgotten about ogels mutant vehicles i guess i meant a bigger cross between the 8636 sub and the big squid from 7775 aquabase invasion  that is such a great design sort of keep the retro feel but make it bigger with the 8636 sub theres really only room for one agent to sit and despite its size theres just a few not amazingly great functions such as the hidden chest and missiles	positive

nice review thanks tlc is really going allout with the agents theme i wonder if it will last longer than one year unlike other recent oneanddone themes my only real criticism of the theme is those freaking stickers my god look at the size of that dss in this set	positive
great review this set totally owns alpha team deep sea the sub design actually looks like a sub the figures are way better the acessories are better  everything is better agents may have my vote for the best theme of the year quote i wonder if it will last longer than one year unlike other recent oneanddone themes oh dont worry  a second wave will be coming next year this was confirmed by both legomilk and in an interview with an agents designer	positive
aside from the price i love this set when i saw the prelim pics of agetns i did not like the theme but all the sets are starting to look more attractive now i can see the cool features and details as for this set i really like the badguy boat for some reason and the submarine looks good  i love the dark blue colour	positive
i forgot to comment on this review great job rezourceman like sveltecorps said your pics really show off the set and what there is to it i just ordered this and the volcano base off sh and i cant wait for them to come so ill comment on these reviews i forgot about i love the inferno boat as you say in your review it looks very heavy duty and ready to take on the agents the sub i quite like from the look of it though there is the problem of too little space i will try and correct that the dark blue is especially good and i love slime face his torso is very cool sveltecorps on jul 11 2008 0914 am said i cant say this is my favourite agents set the boat is a little oddly proportioned and the sub although retro looking has practically no interior and would be difficult to customise to put more in unlike say the clever job batbrick did with the penguin sub in his review wow thanks for that little mention is it impossible or just very hard to mod sveltecorps on jul 11 2008 0914 am said i do agree with you about slime face  he has a fantastic torso with all the slime dripping down which is a bit obscured by the air tank its really encouraging that in the last 2 missions weve had great extra villains added in the only thing i would add about the octopus is that the glow in the dark plastic is mixed in unevenly with the aqua blue so it doesnt glow in the dark evenly  its kind of like the mars mission jellies in that respect though much cooler the octopus sounds great thanks for that is he meant to be on any side im guessing hes a mutant inferno creature about slime face is his head much different to the joker bombs i know he has slime marks on his head are they very apparent thanks again for the review batbrick away	positive
sveltecorps on jul 19 2008 1020 am said nothing is impossible to mod probably the easiest part to change would be the front where the missiles are and the treasure chest slides out  you could make a sizeable compartment there however the middle section is so narrow and the end fins are just that  fins  that it might be harder to expand without changing the shape of the sub youll find out soon when yours arrives thanks for that info i will definitely try anyway when i get the set see if i cant loosen up a few dark blue bricks at the same time sveltecorps on jul 19 2008 1020 am said its not really clear but since all the other mutants are evil or at least controlled by dr inferno its probably a safe bet the squid is too slime faces head is different to the joker bombs  different eyes and teeth although the smile is similar i guess and the slime marks are much more apparent in the flesh or abs although they dont photograph that way joker bomb face below for contrast ah thanks for that info i see that they are more different than i thought now i hope the slime looks good when i get him batbrick away	neutral
inertia on jul 21 2008 1229 pm said wow thanks for the review that is one awesome set i think we need some new agents theres so many inferno minifigures now maybe next year theres only 2 infernos out of 8 sets which is pretty good theres way more agent chases and break jaws i agree though next year hopefully well have some new figs	positive
great looking set and that glowy blue octopus is really cute i might just get it for that be great in a space moc wondering from the pdf instructions i saw it wasnt clear what the agent in the sub is sitting on hows his seat work and it looks like theres a compartment below him	positive

6927 all terrain vehicle year released 1981 piece count 167 minifigs 2 list price 1450 a very unique vehicle in the classic space collection was this allterrain vehicle which i always considered more along the line of a mobile lab the set introducedinfused white and black bricks with classic blue space pieces the result was this great classic vehicle the set includes two figs still red and white heres a view of the vehicle which is really two components the vehicle itself and the lab section i absolutely loved the the blue windshield slopes 2 included and the unique upsidedown large blue slope in the back of the vehicle is the blue lab the back section of the vehicle has hinges that allow the jets sections to open the brick design fits perfectly into the lab and when opened the lab falls to the ground note the little round trans red 1x1s allow the lab to slide up and forward when the jet sections are closed i tried taking off the red 1x1s and the lab does not lift as easily with them the design is very clever esp for a classic set heres a shot of the standalone lab unlike earlier classic space windows this set has train window frames with yellow windows the top of the lab lifts up for playability inside the lab are several computers and a swivel chair back to the vehicle heres a shot of the cockpit with white steering wheel the left side has an upsidedown wrench and black antenna the right side a walkietalkie and another antenna the antennas can be used as breaks to keep the middle wheels from moving heres ashot of the under carriage and a final shot of the complete set for those of you following my classic space reviews this is review number 9 of 10 my final review of anall time favorite will be coming soon hope you enjoyed this review comments are always welcome	positive
thanks for the review this is one of my favorite space sets of all time i even had 2 of them back in the days my only complain about this set was that i found that the wheels where too small  i had some trouble passing the rover over the little cratersmountains of the space plates	positive
thanks for another informative review of the best lego theme ever and not in attempt to hijack your thread but to add to it heres a pic of my blacktron 1 version of this beautiful set the 6927 has to rate as one of the best 5 classic space sets ever along with 918 6970 and 928	positive

oh man this review takes me back i got this set when i was 8 years old and loved it i remember modding it to remove the lab in the back and i put in a giant laser cannon instead cause when youre 8 years old everything needs a giant laser cannon cp5670 on jul 11 2008 1243 am said the only bad thing about this set is the name it cant even roll over a single plates height not very all terrain at all ha very true the vehicle is built so low to the ground that the front end catches on everything	positive

my fish doctor has the torso from 7902 doctors car which is unfortunate because the other torso is more stylized and cartoonish i think however i did have that mad scientist lab set so a bit of digging through my old collection will hopefully yield the better torso	neutral
i recently bought this set for my daughters birthday its the first belville set that ive bought for her so its a bit of an experiment the house is 5 rooms and its made up of mostly large pieces there still is a decent amount of normal lego in it though the doorways in the house align when it is opened out starting with the bathroom included is a shower toilet sink with vanity and a baby potty the mirror sticker is one of the few that i put on the open plan loungekitchendining room is well appointed as well and it has a nice glass table and coffee machine the kitchen chairs are fabuland parts and dont work really well it seems they are having jellyfish for dinner the clock is the only printed part in the set upstairs is a baby room and the master bedroom the radio and the tv not shown were stickers to my disappointment up top is an extra room suitable for reading those antenna things were made from spare parts by my daughter i have no idea what they are supposed to be  there are some stickers that go on the back but i didnt put them on as it is the set looks ok this way but since it is a dolls house it doesnt really matter i do think though that the fireplace should have been given a back the bbq is made from normal parts and is quite effective i think it uses the same light brick thats in the 4998 stegosaurus set my kids were using it as a torch before my grumbling ruined their fun like all belville sets the highlight is arguably the accessories ill be borrowing a few of these from time to time here is the controversial baby catapult as you can see it works ok but lego probably should have tried a bit harder we also bought for her 7583 playful puppy it also comes with some nice accessories but not enough to justify buying unless you want the rest of the parts poor puppy where does he sleep here is my daughter assembling it she made me make the house though as she wanted to play a game we bought her note the lego drink bottles  i didnt take any photos of the figures as they dont seem to be anything new but i can if people want me to at the time i was in bit of a hurry as i took these before bed so i wouldnt be stressed if the kids broke it the next day overall these sets seem overpriced to me and hard to justify unless you actually want a buildable dolls house which we did its still too early to tell if my daughter likes it or not but at this stage it seems she lost interest in a few days she does tend to go back to toys though edited by whitefang 23 may 2009  0703 pm indexed	negative

yay its good to see your kids get to build some stuff too sinner  all through the review i was thinking this was a present  but who actually put it together so im glad the last pic cleared things up as for the set  it looks much bigger than i expected  i think it does make a good sized dollhouse there are a stack of nice pieces in there  cupboards oven transblue 2x5 bricks all the accessories plants flowers food the lightup brick the pink roof slopes  but not enough to justify the aud129 retail price maybe on sale id pick it up and resell the belville figs but david jones hasnt even had a regular 20 off lego sale for the whole of this year that ive seen i think the playful puppy set is a horrendous ripoff for aud20 though i agree with the baby catapult  the range is terrible lego just isnt trying any more is it at least theyve moved on from throwing cats off three storey buildings 2 questions though 1 was it a fun build 2 are those large figs anatomically correct under their froufrou finery if not what the hell are they doing in the second pic whilst baby sylvia explores the oven	neutral

great review and i note something like a bucket in the dog set shame its not blue as for the fire place piece i love it and i want one ever since finding it on mlcad i love the bbq it looks so good you know i might even buy this it it was not so pink now as for the kiddies in ovens make sure they are not over cooked they can be stringy  and as for the couple up stairs now we at least know what you do with your mini figs when no one is looking lego sets in public places  just following your name sake i guess and i must say lego shame shame that catapult needs reviwing hardly even make a dent in a castle wall regards cpt pb	positive
i was sort of hoping for a flickfire baby still this looks decent for what it is i guess obviously it really is all about the accessories and its got em but not enough to make me spend that kind of cash and i dont even mind having a pile of pink parts around if you throw in a complete turkey or some birthday cakes its a slam dunk but as it is eh thanks for the review though its very nicely presented and leaves no doubt in my mind as to just how easy this set would be to misuse for other purposes	neutral
nice review good to see your almost letting your kids play with your lego i like the functionality of the baby catapult its good that they include some working features in a build this big are you not showing the figures because its really hugh hefners playboybelville mansion i dont see the grotto though must be an add on set like the poor puppy its just so darn pink	positive

i bought this today mainly because it was 25 off but id been eyeing it for a long time the accessories truly are brilliant theres so much here to be pillaged for other uses as people have said i picked up heaps of new parts ive never had or rare ones in even rarer colours to be honest i was surprised and impressed by the range and versatility of the regular bricks as well when you look at the box art what jumps out at you are the giant pink walls and curved pieces but theres a nice amount of white arches and lime green bricks not to mention all the windows and the trans blue 1x2x5 bricks and plants its a good thing the target audience likes stickers though theres more here than ive seen on any set except the 7709 sentai fortress i think they were aiming for one sticker per page of instructions i hope belville returns in 2010 thanks for the review sieggy did your daughter ever go back to it	positive

7655 clone battle pack year 2007 number of pieces 58 number of minifigs 4 price 999 usd brickset welcome to my third review on eurobricks i hope you enjoy while at any store that sells lego target walmart tru etc you will notice that the clone battle packs on the shelf are way fewer in number than the droids battle pack as you might guess the clones are way more popular and finding them gets harder and harder as the release date of this set goes farther into the past so stock up alright heres a pic of the box a small box as expected for inexpensive sets like these note the build your army button on the front tlg obviously is encouraging customers to buy multiples and with good reason which will be explained later in this review well lets get straight to it the contents of this set you will notice a speeder bike a gun turret and some clones looking good so far lets have a look at the turret an excellent star wars element to have around especially for mocing it is very cleverly built using a tire guard from city sets for the general shape of the turret mount all you have to do is attach the new mold explained later gun to the 2x1 plate with the center stud and presto i wonder how the clones build these turrets to fast in the middle of battle a rear view with a clone mounted my only gripe about the turret is that you have to take off the gun in order for every clone to have a gun now we move on to the vehicle of the set the speeder bike a rather sleek and good looking bike with some useful pieces on it as well such as the blue cones the megaphones and the engines some say it looks bare without the figs mounted on it but i think it looks just fine the commander drives while a trooper shoots on the back a side view and a rear view my only gripe is the same as the turret you have to remove the back gun for all the clones to have weapons while on foot the back pistol attaches to a 2x2 round studded plate with a technic hole in the middle finnaly here are the new guns this set comes with 1 new blaster rifle and three new pistols it could have included one more rifle for the turret and of course the figs includes 1 yellow commander lovely fig 1 shocktrooper comes with a pair of elctrobinouculars and two regular troopers so clean and white the figs are excellent all that any sw or lego fan should want it could have maybe included one more regular trooper but that might be pushing it thats all for now folks here is the final verdict build 810 extremely easy should take the seasoned builder about 5 minutes to complete a fun build though playability 510 i guess you can get this with the droid battle pack and make them battle but this set has no real play features of its own but it is good for collecting troops and using them for mocs swooshability 910 i guess you can zoom the speeder bike around minifigs 1010 four great figs that should be bought in multiples a great army builder design 1010 a clever turret an awesome speeder and four great clones what more do you need in a 10 dollar set price 810 not bad i suppose but if you calculate a dime for each piece this set should come out to 56 dollars but still billions of these are being sold worldwide and tlg is making a ton of money off of them overall score 9510 a truly memorable set one that will be a favorite for ages to come and very popular a great army builder for a small price plus vehicle and turret with only a few very minor flaws this set is one of the best of star wars and this concludes my review and as always comments are most welcome	positive

hello all eurobricks members and town lovers this is my first classic town review for today i will be featuring the 6641 4wheelin truck which is produced in 1987 for some younger members in eb you might not have encounter such a baby roaming down the streets horning at others with its big massive truck considering this is a 1987 set such a vehicle size is considered big in those days name 4wheelin truck theme lego system  town year 1987 pieces 80 minifigs 1 price usd650 an image of a 6641 4wheelin truck hello everyone why the name 4wheelin truck it is because this truck is equipped with 4 heavy duty wheels which is considered big among other small vehicles in classic town please take note most of the vehicles that are produced in classic town era are 4studs wide this truck is no exception meet the driver and his truck this truck has a very good combinations of different colors that are common for most town vehicles it made used of blue white and red as its primary combinations i find that this combinations is quite soothing to its eyes especially the blue bricks in addition the minifig torso is superb the driver must be a great fan of this vehicle i realised most truck drivers in the classic town era wear this most of the time i wonder if its some kind of an organization front view there is 2 red doors coupled with the truck to enable the driver to get in properly this vehicle is considered big in the 1980s however if you compared it with the current city vehicles this truck certainly will not outsize the current designs please take note of the wheels the wheels are pretty different i dont remember seeing these wheels in many other vehicles maybe some members can help me on this most of the classic town vehicles have a window frame on top which is known as a sunroof in this set this feature is also included furthermore the vehicle frame has a simple mechanism which all town lovers love it is to lift it up and place their driver in and out the seat most importantly you do not have to take off the entire window frame just to put in the driver different angles of the 4wheelin truck snot technique back 20 years ago lego had been experimenting with snot technique you can see that the back looks very neat without the studs in addition it can be quite useful to place a minifig on top of it or throw some baggage for some quick getaway summary review playability 810 great addition to your town collection design 8510 very good design i love 4studs truck at least it is able to occupy one side of the lane price 910 an inexpensive set based on the 1987 pricing overall 8510 a must have for all classic town lovers we have been complaining for more wider range of vehicle i gave it a 4 based on my review score card what about yours hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine pictures can be found in my brickshelf when moderated edited by whitefang 13 july 2008  1208 pm	positive

whitefang on jul 13 2008 1125 am said the wheels are pretty different i dont remember seeing these wheels in many other vehicles maybe some members can help me on this first of all another great review thanks for doing these as for the wheels these were primarily technic wheels but did find their way into some other models in white i can only find a handful of minifig sets that they are included with theres half a dozen space sets but apart from the 4wheelin truck the only other town set appears to be the 6524 blizzard blazer tractor with snow plough the wheels were also in a train set called 4549 road  rail hauler where they were the wheels on a big forklift cheers rog	neutral
love this set nice review also i had the set in my hands a few times but never bought it though i drooled at it i remember i guess i didnt get pocket money at that time it was not that common around europe in the 80s i guess so better to say that no one bought it for me a few years later i got the safari truck which is also really sweet i like the colors of this model and the detail of it the minifig is really classic made only for this set appears in some later train sets as well and shows the exact image of the truck on the shirt including the motor piece one of the most detailed and loveliest little sets from a sweet era of legoland city ps voted o for outstanding edited by zzz 14 july 2008  0950 am	positive
hmmm i probably would not have bought this as a kid in 1987 unless i had money to spare or the shop had no other set from space or castle the two other big lines in 1987 and no better set in the town section i think its a great parts pack but the model itself does not look very attractive i never really liked those wheels honestly theyre from the basic sets mostly and they work pretty well in those but im just not a fan the roof on the other hand was very popular and the blue modified bricks at the front were quite rare in those days but generally speaking this was not the star of 1987 gave it a 3	negative

i now found pics too thats absolutely  after 10188 town plan this is the best city set ever i really like the neat landscape with the little hill there are a bench and some flowers on it too  and this brilliant cottage  great idea with that power function that the wind mill turns and then enable the lights of the cottage  concerning the city theme i must say in the last time tlg comes up with one great surprise after the other does anyone know where and when itll be available this year i think  otherwise there wouldnt be already pics would they and how much itll cost i think about 70 euros what do you think i only hope that itll be available in germany too otherwise i would be really if i am not able to get it since it is a must for every city and environment fan klausdieter edited by klausdieter 14 july 2008  0649 pm	neutral

the figs theyre possibly the best part of the entire set all in all nice new head although the glasses limit its usability i am in love with the head on that fig its perfect for any number of figures  a good scarred hero face has always been on my want list im turning him into my viking warlord after i post this review again a new head great stubbly beard thing going on my secondfavorite head of the lot great for warriors especially with helms the torsos are fantastic for special forces figures if anyones planning to do something like that not too fond of the lime green on there but its still extremely usable this is actually a really cool machine gun i like it i think this would be a good point to note that all designs you see  outside the figures and dinos  are stickers that means a crapload of stickers if you cant stand stickers at all in a set dont buy this	positive
the base of the propeller it wobbles a bit but doesnt fall off very sturdy right side of the rear propeller and the left and better side the tail it uses construction similar to the xwings nose but on a larger scale definitely cool a very neat part of the copter the guns are constructed so that  they turn without turning the cockpit the interior is rather blase though	positive
as unexpected as it was this was very helpful  three questions though 1 is the front green rubber missle a traditional launchable missle or does it have another firing mechanism 2 concerning the guns on the side are they fixed in one postition or does it have any functions 3 why did you decide to buy this set just curious	neutral

great review jay  tks a lot  i am not that of the big fan of the copter due to its proportions  but i admit its really asome looking better as i expected od the best are those mfs  they are truly awsome  i wiil but some of the smaller sets just for the figs hehe too bad that my favorite  your second best  dont come in the smallers sets   are you going to review the other sets as well  that could be cool 	positive

wow i think this is the first time im the first to have a new set at least here and review it got it 2 days ago thanks to a fast shipping from sh this time and i found time now to review it now enough of the babbling lets let the facts and pictures speak which actually turned out pretty well this time set nr 4210 name coast guard platform number of minifigs 4 number of pieces 469 release year 2008 a few shots of the box first 2 books of instructions we got here first one for the helicopter second one for the rest and the platform itself a general overview of the platform from above the 4 minifigs 3 rescue guys and one oil rig worker  the pilot seems not very happy that he has to work in the middle of nowhere at sea right beside the entry of the tower we have the diving equipment holder next the guy can jump in this little speedboat and another guy brings it down to water with the crane if somebody is rescued from the air he arrives here and is brought to the tower with the little moving platform than runs on rails down under we got a buoy and several life belts and extinguishers with the lift somebody who is rescued by the boat can be brought up i think it would been better if they would have made a mechanism there to bring it up but its okay a few floors higher the sea is being observated and watched on the ground level we have the medical stationwarmup room the helicopter as standalone all in all for me this is besides the police station the city set of this year its got great features and looks fantastic and also has many useful pieces you cant do anything wrong with buying it 1010 for me thats all for now hope you liked my review edit oh damn i forgot to write review in the topic title can a mod please add this thanks	positive

excellent review metalandi its always great to see early pictures of new sets this set really reminds me of an oil rig and could probably be easily modified as one if one wanted an alternate model the two components that i like most are the boat crane and the control room but other sections are pretty slick as well are those printed pieces in the control room or stickers im really starting to gain an appreciation for these new coast guard sets theyve come a long way over the years 575 coast guard station released 1978 i picked up the control boat  tower 7739 a few weeks ago but havent opened it yet in any case thanks for taking the time to review this set and share it over eb	positive

i think it looks good on the real set i thought the darker glass might be good on the ground level so the rescued guy has it nice and dark in there	positive
nice review this is just the crown jewel for the coast guard theme i love the layout of its platform it looks real neat to have it placed it in the midst of the deep blue sea awaiting of any emergency rescue sometimes i feel that this set can used it to merge with my aqua raiders sets i thought of using it as a land base for the raiders to dock in their stuff before submerge into the ocean ok its just a wierd idea of mine just feel that aqua raiders and coast guard can work hand in hand since they are naval expertise it seemed i cant view all the pictures somehow nevertheless i can still view some of it quite well i love the command center the amount of computer printed pieces simply make me smile with the monitor keyboard radar screen and etc the helicopter is cute too however i pity the victim that is loaded at the back it seemed a little bit too dangerous in addition this set seemed to have quite alot of stickers which can be quite discouraging i do hope to see this set soon so far i quite like the current coast guard sets	positive

paramedic unit set  6364 year released 1980 piece count 140 minifigs 2 list price unknown well let me first say that the english name paramedic unit is not really a good name for this set the function of a paramedic is to take a patient from an emergent situation and deliver them to a hospital for treatment generally an emergency room this is a rather small clinic that i would imagine is more for family care than an emergency room in addition the car looks more like a doctornurses car rather than an ambulance or emergency response vehicle i would call this a clinic rather than a paramedic unit in any case its a great set esp for table towns that need medical services what i like is that this set is small enough to place anywhere in your lego city or town starting with the instructions like all the classic town sets alternate models are pictured although i never tried building one i like the little medical busvan the set includes two minifigs that include a female doctore or nurse and what i presume is a patient based on the torsos i really like the vehicle its a 4stud wide two seater the colors work well and i like the use of the white bar between the seats and the 1x1 blue plates for lights unfortunately the emblems are stickers heres a shot of the neat little clinic i like the use of the blinds for the exam room it shows that lego considered patient privacy when making this set the interior includes an exam room desk and two blue swivel chairs and a neat little eye chart although the letters l e g o would have made a nice touch lastly a picture of the complete set i must admit that i remember buying this set back in the 80s and i regreted it after taking it home im not sure what i didnt like about it perhaps the girl back then but now i really think its a neat set well theres a line of patients waiting to have their eyes checked comments welcome	neutral

paramedic unit does not seem to suit well for this sets name it should be named as clinic outpatient treatment family doctor and etc from what i understand parmedic unit is a standalone unit that is on standby 247 ready for any emergency rescue in lego town ambulance with a group of paramedics will be ideal for this kind of situation i love female doctors especially with that lovely hairpiece the cruiser is a neat 4studs wide design just love these small car designs back then i wonder what can be used at the back of its boot the clinic is neat maybe we can send holodoc for some medical audit to make sure that this clinic is up to standard what surprised me the most is the neat little eye chart you dont see such details in any regular lego set the red and white color combination for the building works well for me most of the hospital buildings and vehicles always revolved in red and white i gave this a 4 thanks you so much brickster	positive
i just cant believe someone would rate this set a 1 it appears to be a trend among these classic reviews never with a comment of why	neutral
grevious on jul 19 2008 1004 am said wasnt this the first hospital with modern minifigs because i seem to remember seeing an even older hospital online that had the armless faceless figs youre correct this was the first hospital 555	neutral
thank you for all these reviews thebrickster and the idea with the polls is a very nice and interesting idea it will only take a while until i will have commented on all  so please give me some time  i gave this set a four the vehicle the minfigs and the design of the house are excellent  only the interior could be a bit spiced up telephone some other equipment klausdieter	positive
whitefang on jul 18 2008 0911 pm said paramedic unit does not seem to suit well for this sets name it should be named as clinic outpatient treatment family doctor and etc the definition of a paramedic is someone who assists physicians in providing medical care i think in more modern times a paramedic is generally thought of as a more qualified and experienced ambulance technician but the dictionary definition would seem to fit with the lego model quite well cheers rog	neutral

wow old thread just for the record so long as it is here paramedics are advanced ambulance technicians unlike standard emts they are trained for advanced cardiac life support they can push drugs defibrillate place a breathing tube etc in the 1980s when the set was made it was quite common for paramedics to respond to calls in fly cars or special response units they would join up with ambulances at the scenes that required their skills if you ever watched the old american tv show emergency johnny gage and squad 51 were one of these response units they were mostly phased out in the 90s in favor of simply putting the paramedics and als gear in the ambulances	neutral
cool review ive always loved these hard looking tyres i never understood why they dont make them anymore they looked way more offroadish	neutral
this is one of my favorite town vehicles from the old time and for one specific reason the truck is on the guys shirt it didnt matter that the color was wrong or the hook was missing i thought it was awesome beyond imagination for some reason thanks for the review whitefang	positive
i rate this a 5 one of my last sets before my dark age suspension wheels are superb and are rare the minifig although smiling really looks tough because of the tanktop oh did i say im giving it a 5	positive

thanks for all of your encouraging comments i am glad most of you love to view our classic reviews do stay out for more upcoming exciting classic town reviews i appericiate greatly by all of your words there are many outstanding reviews from brickster as well especially those classic vintage lego sets that i had never seen before except browsing it in brickset therefore i will encourage eb members to take some time off to view these truly wonderful classic reviews trust me it shall be an eye opening experience for each and everyone of you whom had never seen classic town in such an up close personal experience before lasse d on jul 19 2008 1222 am said this is one of my favorite town vehicles from the old time and for one specific reason the truck is on the guys shirt it didnt matter that the color was wrong or the hook was missing i thought it was awesome beyond imagination for some reason the torso is just lovely i felt the 6641 4 wheelin truck is almost identical with the torso except for the front color combination click onto the picture for an instant review bernddasbrot on jul 19 2008 0247 am said btw the 6350 pizza to go van looks soooo cute yes that cute pizza van appeared for a reason	neutral
another great review whitefang this is a wonderful 80s vehicle  and i think it might be one of the first  if not the first  that had the spring suspension system i know of at least one other set that had that the biggest extreme team set from 1998 had a vehicle with those pieces quote this tow truck is pretty useful as you can see current city sets hardly have any tow trucks available to tow new cars design this tow truck is catered for 4studs vehicles for classic town can you imagine yourself this truck towing a speed racer car i think it looks really out of proportion firstly speed racer cars are out of scale even with city vehicles also i have hope that in the next few years we will get more octan sets to go with the wonderful gas station  and i suspect that a 6wide tow truck will be at the top of the list it wouldnt be a hard set to make and i bet it would sell well edited by grevious 19 july 2008  0531 pm	positive
45 ive had this set since i was young never understood why a tow truck needed to be an offroader maybe it was used to tow the other offroad vehicles the suspension made the truck too tall to tow some cars so i often took the hook out and use the truck as just an great offroad truck like 6672 which also had the suspension wheels other tow truck sets better filled their roles better but that doesnt diminish this set at all whitefang on jul 18 2008 0919 am said i think it looks really out of proportion no for 25odd years this vehicle was perfectly proportioned with all others in the towncity line its all these new 6 and 8 and 20 wide vehicles that are ignoring convention and making it look out of proportion granted speed racer sets are more of their own line but 6660 is smaller than most of the cars produced in the last few years	positive

brickster you need your own sticky review section i love looking at all of these old sets as i have said before you take me back to a much simpler time thank you and on to the set i love this gas station lego really needs to look to its past on some of these sets for the time the level of detail is great i wish i still had this one in one piece as well	positive
again great topicpoll thebrickster i gave this set a 3 which is on the one hand negative is that its really oldfashioned for today  which is on the other hand positive is that it includes very nice and authentic details like e g doors in the cars  which is imo for that time a feat  klausdieter	neutral
okay guys i have built the set so lets review set name 7649 mt201 ultra drill walker price 6999 pieces 759 bought from tor r us in michigan us the box first we have the front it shows the set its functuns and the limited edition sign the box is huge about the size of the dino attack chopper set or the mars mission base nowadays most set that are 5000 or more have a flap displaying the sets functions opening theflap on this box reveals a gigantic picture of the set and the back the bags numbered next the manuals they have piece call outs page numbers etc there are 2 manuals with this set sticker sheets they actually arent all that bad random manual image build first we open bag 1 this will build the alien craft and the minifigures now here we have some interesting parts a green spine from exoforce and a black rim for the set container stacker next we start the build on the alien craft it is pretty sturbdy but has no cockpit for the alien the alien stickers are really cool they are rainbowish and has a silver back next come the build on the wings and the finished craft it is pretty good and has a nice sleek design however i think i will use the large ship for the commander out this year to fight the driller instead next is bag 2 which builds the rover and astro ship first is the ship it starts off with doctor infernos colors it builds up very nice and the detail is absolutley amazing next the roof is built it has some speed racer slopes the hinge piee now has a hole through it sorry for the blurry pic more is added then comes the bottom piece the detail is very nice and the hinge piece has a use later on then you build the crates each one holds two crystals added to the ship also a pic of the finished ship here we start the rover it sports anice detail the orange studs get coveded by the grill to look more like an engine the detail in this thing is pretty good it has a gun and shovel here is how it fits into the ship it slides in and is secured thanks to the hinge okay so next we open the number 3 bag which builds the body here are some interesting pieces then we start the build it begins nice and study i just love these stickers with the bulldogs on them more of the build with the stickers added next we add in the front part the detail is again outstanding with the turntable added it can move down as well the next step is to build the water tank it utilizes the bionicle boostersbig white things and added to the walker then we build that drill it uses a lot of rims and such with the gears added the front part uses a lot of those new droideka 3prong things and bionicle eyes the drill can spin thanks to the gears and added to the vehical next is the cockpit it has a nice space for the astros bckpack added the final stage is the legs thank god they arent like striking venoms they are all the same however see those two rubber parts those keep it in place when on surfaces like glass next come the large part of the legs these are similar to the assault tigers legs the final result is very sturdy thanks too notice the amazing classic space sticker so we finally come down to this the final result is amazing it is sturdy and has great detail it is very realistic and when the ship is removed the drill goes down and the turret is aimed up hope you all enjoyed the review	positive

looks like a great set i may consider making this the first mars mission set i buy nice review also but quote lol thanks i just wanted to claim my place for the review personally i dont think you had a place to claim somebody else could have also gotten this set and had a proper review ready before yours but felt it was wrong to post because you had posted a placeholder  clubninja in this case i think placeholders should be banned and if you are not ready to post a full review you should not post anything simple really either that or what is the policy on here regarding more than one review of a set being posted  then you could have both posted reviews and it wont really matter i guess just my 2 cents worth thanks for the review though	positive
sweet review metalandi this set always looked a bit too busy for my liking i guess i just didnt expect to see a set so tall after seeing your review though it is growing on me i like all the play features and at the very least its a great parts pack two things im confused about though in this pic is that dragon being used as a swing set and i dont get why the area where the witch casts her spells on the second floor is green green in castle means grass or forestmen  and having grass on the second floor of a building is just weird i understand that its modular and thus it would make sense if it were placed on the ground but dark grey would make just as much sense and would look much better than the green there imo anyway im just fussy thanks again for the cool review will we be seeing any more peace	negative

i thoroughly enjoyed your review metalandi thank you especially for taking photos of all the contraptions and detailing exactly how they work as a member of classiccastle the census always seemed to be that fright knights were a class 410 or 610 but as sandy stated above it is one of the closest you can get to an evil faction by todays standards the contraptions seen here are much much more sophisticated and well thought out and are definitely missing in 2007s kings castle siege i enjoy the design of this castle much more even if the towers are taller simply because the design in the kings castle siege left builders with an empty space right in the courtyard without even a base plate and its nearly impossible to get your hands in and play in the enclosed space why would anyone unless youre simply posing figs and even that was difficult this castle instead had a variety of trap doors and surprises so despite the varied colors used here its not that hard to realize that the designers for this castle really took time to think things out and tried to make the castle enjoyable for the children that will play with it whereas our 2007 castle was strictly built to give kids the impression of an enormous magnificant castle with little to nothing inside its like comparing beauty 2007 to brains this castle edited by legobear 20 july 2008  0132 am	positive

metalandi thanks for doing this fright knights review by opening up a misb set which you have bought recently i am very sure the feeling is very nice especially touching the bricks which is preserved for 11 years sealed in bags i am quite fond of the fright knights theme unfortunately this theme was released during my dark age i never really bought sets from fright knights instead i bought plenty of minifigs to build an army if i could turn back time or find another misb set with a reasonable price i am very sure i will get it my soldiers need a castle to stay in i will be looking forward to your next review keep up the good job	neutral
i read this review not long after you posted it but im not sure why i didnt comment if dragonator is the one to post everytime he sees a dragon related topic i would be the one to post if i see a fright knights topic fright knights is one of my favourite lego themes and this review is really good i got both of the castles in the theme and loved them and your review presents basil the batlords castle well i too thought it was a bit weird that there is a green base when it could be grey but i guess its a useful piece to use in other things fright knights on	positive
wow what a cool castle and set in general i had no idea that this set existed long dark ages thanks to you metalandi for such a great review the figures look really nice and the set is full of lots of little trinkets  details traps etc i have already had a look on ebay for this set looks like a great set for parts too i give the review 455 evil witches cheers isc	positive
my first post in this topic looks foolish now that i bought this set from ebay i just really wanted the minifigs although i already had the batlord and the black dragon and the parts they will help me greatly in building the impenetrable fortress of the dragonwarriors for my princess quest comic by the end of this week this set will be in my clutches	positive
well that the bricks look new comes from that they are new i got this set new and unopened	neutral
good review  the photo from above shows off the scale of the castle much better than the box photo i was one of those who always thought this set looked lame ever since first seeing it in the catalogue a couple of my siblings had smaller bat lordfright knight sets and enjoyed the accessories and style of the minifigs etc so last year having not only ended my dark ages but done so for some of the rest of my family i got this set off ebay for my sister for christmas i of course had to build it to make sure all parts were there before leaving ebay feedback and ending the transaction first impressions were of how much brick there was to the set as well as really useful large structural elements and to be honest while perhaps a bit childish theres no doubt the style of the minifigs is kinda cute and useful for customs it was really enjoyable building this set and the scale is impressive when built empty spaces notwithstanding but hey lego has always had buildings with no back etc  just use your imagination and enjoy the access to playspace offered the traps etc are neat and more like the kind of action features modern sets come with i for one am in favour of these for kids they are fun and i think for builders they give ideas cause they are often done with minimal parts or impact on the set design anyways needless to say my sister loved the set indeed shes currently rebuilding it for the second time if i see it as cheap again i will pick up one for myself i got the first one at €30 incl postage i believe	positive
i got a couple of the small sets from this line when it came out recently i acquired several more from bricklink because i just really love the way they look this theme really had good intentions but the execution was flawed i hope one day lego returns to a darker tone but maybe next time it could be more castlevania inspired that would really turn some heads plus vampires and gothic aesthetics are really popular now it will probably have run its course by the time lego would be able to develop a theme around them though	negative
great review again its nice to see old sets reviewed i love the control stickers theres a great level of detail this is really the second best fire station in my opinion	positive
lovely i cant stop making comparisons between this fire station and last years which is also very well detailed with great features and awesome playability the concept design of the second one its very much like the one reviewed here this is good as tlg is taking back those great values to make the new excellent sets we all are enjoying by now	positive
i am a proud owner of this set this is one of the best fire stations ever what amazes me is what the designers made with only 368 pieces you get a very nice looking building in good size a good baseplate 2 cars 4 minifigs accessories and great alternative ideas in the back of the box like the fire boat or helicopter this is a great example of lego design	positive

i must agree great fire station i love the fact that in the classic sets you were given a base plate and some other great ideas i do miss the addition of base plates and alternate building ideas the only newer set i have seen with any alternate build photos is the 7239 fire engine i miss back when	positive

a truly great set i always loved the mobile crane and was gobsmacked when this popped up using some of the great features from the crane but also making it an emergency vehicle too great classic firemen and  in your version  a suspiciously blue fire extinguisher great review of a great set  just a pity i no longer have it so many sets i used to have got lost during the period at the end of my childhood before i rescued what was left from my dads house once i realised what i had left behind hindsight is a great thing cheers again rog	positive
guys thanks for all of your wonderful and encouraging comments towards this set this was one of my most favourite set in the late 1980s and i am glad to restore it somehow with a small little part missing which could not be that hard to replace bernddasbrot on jul 22 2008 1206 am said but this review induced me to get over this humiliation from my childhood   and check ebay for the 6358 bernd i am glad reviews like these mananged to change your perception towards this set honestly this is a very good set to pass by and i hope i had highlight the key features in this set hope you will have an easy time getting it from ebay or bricklink rriggs on jul 22 2008 1231 am said great classic firemen and  in your version  a suspiciously blue fire extinguisher good job by spotting the replacement part which is hiding among them thats why i show the orignal image lord of pies on jul 22 2008 1234 am said i cant help but feel thought that these reviews are being churned out to quickly you should leave a gap i am being flooded with all these great reviews you should really take some time off and sit in front of the town and trains forum looking through at your childhood memories where classic reviews like this are released in this forum i am leaving some gaps in between my reviews now i supposed brickster will slow down soon captain green hair on jul 22 2008 0207 am said this definitly is a nice set i think this was also the first set to use that white basket cgh you are absolutely right this is the first set that made use of the white basket component in fact there is only 2 sets in the entire lego theme which have make used of the white basket it is the 6477 which is released in 2000 i am quite surprised after 13 years they are able to produced it again thebrickster on jul 22 2008 1010 am said what an awesome little set i really like this engine but dont remember seeing it during the late 80s it must have been out during my dark ages i love the basketsection for the firemen equally nice is the fire hose which extends a good length the color combination of red with white and the trans blue windshield looks goos as well this is a great engine and one that would look perfect in a classic tabletown  and its 4studs wide very nice review whitefang i look forward to seeing more of your classic town reviews you shared the same sentiments as i do its a pity that set was released during the dark age of yours on the other hand these sets are my childhood sets which i grew up with more classic town reviews all the way edit this is my 1000th eurobricks post since i joined it has been another great milestone for me in eurobricks edited by whitefang 22 july 2008  0646 am	neutral
thats a great reviewpoll whitefang i gave this set a 5 its simply  the only thing which i miss are the respirators for the firemen since they already own air tanks but otherwise this set is brilliant i like it much more than the new one from 2007 since its not that big and juniorized klausdieter	positive
great set i found only one major fail  this  the hands of robot arms gets easly broken	positive
thanks for the review this set was outstanding for its time with all the features and detail the extending basket is just wonderful however i honestly wouldnt consider it the best firetruck ever i actually like the one from 2005 even better  becasue like most of the city vehicles it adds the needed bulk big engines like fire trucks need many of the older kits while awesome were honestly a little too skinny imo	positive
guys thanks for all your great comments nikola bathory on jul 22 2008 0657 pm said it offers very good playability and this ladder is so long you can have so much fun with it yes the extended length of the ladder provides great playability klausdieter on jul 25 2008 0301 am said i like it much more than the new one from 2007 since its not that big and juniorized thanks kd i owned the 2007 fire engine as well as this set was not restored back then and i needed a fire engine very badly i managed to restored it somehow and i compared it with the 2007 the older design is still the best osakana on jul 25 2008 0403 am said great set i found only one major fail  this  the hands of robot arms gets easly broken yes this is an interesting finding i remembered when i was a child that robot arms always come out of its own when i fiddle with it i was so annoyed by it and i just kept it there whenever i deployed it for rescue missions grevious on jul 26 2008 0200 am said however i honestly wouldnt consider it the best firetruck ever i actually like the one from 2005 even better  becasue like most of the city vehicles it adds the needed bulk big engines like fire trucks need many of the older kits while awesome were honestly a little too skinny imo grevious i appericate your honest comments and given me your insight towards this set and state a comparison as well i agreed with you that fire engines need to be big and sturdy on the other hand it can be nice to have the fire engine to look slim as well to cut through the traffic easily i am not against with the newer sets it just that part of the reasons which reflected in the review had fufill the basic key factors of a typical fire engine in addition it was my alltime favourite under the firefighting theme	positive

7676 republic attack gunship number of pieces 1034 number of minifigs 5 price 11999 usd brickset hey everyone i just got the rgs yesterday at tru after i came home from camp i saw all of the topics that i missed and noticed a minireview and a review with one pic so i thought id make a huge shiny new review that has lots of pictures and all of the requirements of kimts index note i did not apply any stickers to it as a personal liking so lets start by looking at the box a shiny clean and futuristic box quite different from the other star wars box designs before this there was so much clone wars merchandise with this font and design in the huge display at the front of my local toys r us store and not just lego it so beautiful with the white and sky blue anyways for some reason the boxes of the new clone wars sets seemed more shiny than usual maybe its because they were just shipped but once you pick up the boxes they will feel really good in your hands despite the fact that only about half of the space in the boxes are used the back of the box the back shows all of the main features of the set plus pictures of the three other clone wars sets meant to be released alongside this one although i did spot the twilight and homing spider droid which were supposed to be released in september or october so on to the gunship built straight from the bags it took me about 4 12 hours with breaks it has an overall great design but somewhat fragile especially when building it the cockpits always fall apart when opened as well as the bubbles on the wings which i will get into more later the color scheme is very well done you can always find the piece youre looking for thanks to the color diversity red dark red lime green ooh blue black tan light bley dark grey yellow and white also split down the middle vertically the ship is almost all symmetrical front side now lets start with the many features that this set is hiding the front has lots of lime green a rare color but more importantly a rotating gun is found on each side they rotate in a pretty wide range although fragile cockpits there are two main cockpits right next to each other not very detailed and are the same and for some reason the whole cockpit element flips up to reveal nothing just the skeleton of the ship probe droid storage above the cockpit lies a plate that can be flipped up to reveal a storage area that holds two of these probe droids at least thats what i think they are hull in this pic two features are hidden mobile command center the first of the two is a mobile command center but essentially just a hover chair it is found by flipping up the two panels on either side of the hull bacta tank the second is the bacta tank found by just sliding it out of the storage area behind the mcc one half of the tank opens so a minifigure can go inside and heal hisher wounds obtained in battle cargo hold now this is probably the main feature for this set the two sliding doors two on each side slide open thanks to a clever technic mechanism not much in here just a gun holder and a place where the passengers wait to be dropped off in battle speeder bike i guess you guys saw it the speeder bike it is found by opening the rear flap the bike is very cleverly designed by using a brown trike body its only a few centimeters shorter than the bike found in the clone battle pack rear gun just a gun similar to the front ones engines huge engines or are they cannons that are really fun to build they really give that cartoon feel to this set missiles in between the engines are two sets of four flickfire missiles bubble cockpits there is one bubble cockpit on each wing that supposedly control the turrets at the front very fragile storage containers two storage containers on each side hold the clone accessories but i wouldnt recommend putting them in there because the antennae can fall out or you might forget about them sticker sheet the dreaded sticker sheet dss has all of the stickers you need for this set unfortunately mine was crunched up i dont like stickers much anyways but i might still apply some note the republic symbol stickers why couldnt tlg just use that printed piece from a few years back also you get to choose between a birdrat thing or a sleeping twielk as your hull decal what theyre for i dont know looks like the movie or show will explain it though minifigs finally the five minifigs of this set they are all great figs including commander cody amazing especially with the gear the orange is nice but i thought he was yellow clone trooper again amazing the gear is great and the new helmet and torso are great all of the clones in the clone wars line have the same heads also you can see the flesh beneath the helmet asaaj ventress not so happy about this one the torso and dark blue legs are cool but the dress is pretty ugly the head is alright but could do without the cartoony face yeah i know its from a cartoon also has purple markings on back of head obiwan kenobi pretty cool besides the face cool hair and torso though plo koon beautiful the true gem of this set in my opinion the head is the same material as kit fistos and the tosro is awesome good for making a custom kiadi mundi well thats about it here is the final verdict build 810 very fun and easy should take the seasoned builder about 4 hours somewhat fragile playability 9510 lots of fun features although some can break easily swooshability 310 i wouldnt recommend flying it around much as you can barely pick it up safely but with two hands gripping the bottom firmly it can be moved around but not spun or swooshed etc minifigs 810 all very great figs especially plo koon but could have included more clone troopers design 7510 some excellent ideas included in here although some spots are very fragile price 710 should have been only 100 usd if not for the new molds plus at tru it was 130 usd overall score 8510 a great set to have for your star wars clone wars collection with some flaws save up for this one so how did you like my review your feedback is much appreciated jimbutcher out edited by jimbutcher 15 september 2008  0306 am

okay if this were the first review of the set id understand your want to reserve a thread for your review but seriously there are already reviews out there couldnt you have just waited at least until you had actually built the thing or even better until the review was actually done sorry if im being to harsh but im quite sick of these blablabla set review  will be up soon its getting quite annoying peace	neutral
thank you oky wan and apologies to the rest of you guys i guess i was rushing a bit and didnt think this through it was wrong of me to reserve a review if someone does an indepth review before me someone please close this topic otherwise i guess i will do it again many apologies for opening this topic before i actually had a review bad example from me very sorry	neutral

jimbutcher finally i had seen something that is worth reading and viewing imho this is your best star wars review i had ever read most importantly it is a complete review which has substance you have my thanks keep up the good job back to the rgs this is the next star wars set i will be getting i cant wait to lay my hands on this set and start building basically how bad this set can be it cant be worse republic gunship is one of the alltime favourites in star wars prequel and ot i cant find any faults except being too expensive due to the licence cost in addition the minifigs are the next big thing seriously i am quite impressed with it on the down side my rating will go up if there is an additional clone trooper instead of one nevertheless this is a must get set no matter what	positive

hey everyone my wife took me to legoland for my birthday just last week we had a fantastic time and it gave me the chance to pick up some of the new castle sets and battlepacks i was really impressed by the sets i bought and decided to do my first review let battle commence set name tower raid set number 7037 price gbp £1999 pieces 364 the models heres a shot of the complete set the set is made up of two models the crown knights tower and the orcs siege tower lets start with the crown knights tower a knight readies himself for battle my favourite model from the set the wicked orcs siege tower please note that for the purposes of display i mounted the orcs banner onto a small cone set on the top platform of the siege tower this doesnt come with the set but saves any orcs having to hold onto it all he time there are other areas it can be placed without using extra parts features both models look great and have excellent features the set as a whole has great playability and seems to have been concieved with a storyline the crown knights have a captured orc within the walls of their tower so the orc army has been sent out to recover him or are they merely after the gold the knights keep horded away the orcs siege tower has a powerful ram  springloaded by the simple arrangement of an elastic band  so pulling it back sends it flying out the front knocking down the wall on the side of the knights tower and releasing the captive orc the floor panels inside the prison are laid over a lip on the inside of the collapsible wall so fall in when theyre not supported theres a string at the rear for extending the boarding ramp and letting a fearsome orc warrior charge across flickfire action the battle heats up as the orcs close in the minifigures the crown knights i really like the crown knights theyre metallic helmets look great and they come with nice accessories the archer has a double printed head with a frightened look on the other side too im not surprised id be frightened when staring over the ramparts at these the orcs these guys really do look the part worthy advesaries to the crown knights the details are superb the printed elements weapons and helmets all set the orcs aside on the battlefield the set comes with a great new molded armour neckpiece too the mighty orc leader looks wicked in his full battlegear overview theres so much to this set its hard not to be impressed the orcs siege engine is a thing of beauty or terror and would look great on any battlefield the crown knights tower although basic looks good and has great playability im a big fan of the new castle knights and fantasy minifigures and the inclusion of five of them is just enough for this set and as a booster to any army at £1999 in the uk this set is well worth the money for content and quality id highly recommmend this set as a musthave purchase for anyone a final shot of the siege tower with a host of orcs ready for battle i hope you enjoyed my review ill be posting my next one for 7040 dwarves mine defender soon	positive
i got this set in the spring during my buy every new castle set availableseason granted i couldnt afford all of them but i do have most of them now anyway i love the action elements to this set and the siege tower really does look wicked id like to attach the crownie tower to the kings castle to see how it fits but i unfortunately dont own that set yet i also love the turning head of the soldier and ive used it in my princess questcomic as well along with the turning head of the princess the troll leader brings good variety to the army of trolls but they still could use another face type and more torso options its a nice review in any case although the set pretty much speaks for itself	positive
hey good review and good photos i also got this set just recently and i wasnt very enthusiastic about it at the beginning but after i built it i could appreciate it the siege engine is very nice but my complaint has do with the proportions of the knights tower in respect to the trolls machine  its a bit smaller and less bulkier that complaint has to go with some other sets too for example the troll warship is really humongous  it feels like it can load the evil wizards tower and sail off other than that  a good set i like it 45 from me	positive
excellent review and your pictures are very good i look forward to seeing more review i really like this set i got it some time ago and keep meaning to post some pictures of it going up against some of the older castles	positive
very nice review pedro you beat me to it there was a review done about january but i wanted to have a go just havent opened the box yet great pics and well demonstrated action elements too i rate this as one of the coolest castle sets just for its playability and 5 figures this will def add to my orc army and i may purchase more of this set if they dont release a orc bp keep up the good work	positive

pedro for your first review you have amaze me with your photo session and the strucutre of your review i am very impressed by your high quality pictures you have done an excellent job i love the tower raid very much as it offers high playability with the wall and flooring falling down when the ram hits the wall its quite interesting to play with the mechanism of the ram is very fun to play with as well i will try and pull back and released it to knock a row of soldiers this is one of my favourite sets in castle 2008 well done	positive
whitefang on jul 30 2008 1256 am said pedro for your first review you have amaze me with your photo session and the strucutre of your review i am very impressed by your high quality pictures you have done an excellent job i completely agree this is an amazing review  bits of humor great photography and detailed descriptionsphotos based upon this review ive placed an order for this set along with some convincing from amazons 20 sale  the only drawbacks in this set that i can see concerns the tower with it being 1 small compared to the seige tower and 2 missing a few walls however this is also the joy of lego as one can simply purchase a few bricks and build their own walls andor expand the towers size or even attach it to a castle of course this increases the price of the set but considering how cheap bricks are on bricklink tower raid is still a very good value i hope you continue doing reviews pedro	positive
i have one of these and must say that this is the best castle set in the theme and the most useful parts pack for its size yet	positive
name jungle duel set ref 7624 number of minifigs 3 number of pieces 90 price 900 a basic review of 7624 my apologies for the blurry and grainy pictures my camera is acting up  the build is nothing speicial on to the figs indiana jones mutt williams and irina spalkoi nice array of minifigs although i think they should have included a russian soldier or two if you look to the right on mutts jacket it has his name in script the tent is great aside from the fact that the fabric bends easily a nice amount of speicial pieces the weapons rack is pretty nifty so is the table when you swap the white piece with a black one overall it is a very nice set the 1000 price tag isnt so bad either thanks for reading playability1010 price810 figs810 build510 overall rating810 i recommend this set to all indiana jones and lego fans edited by wulf 29 july 2008  0250 pm	positive

time for my first review 7673 magnaguard starfighter peices 431  of figs 2 price 4499 usd the box pretty decent size box for the price magnaguards the normal box stuff front of the ship back open cockpit back of the box contents dss dreaded sticker sheet first manual page because its super important not to build on carpet  fig build the magna guard head imo its beautiful  the purple cone cape box the capes just one the magnaguard back the parts nicely sorted the new windshield piece beautiful the first step seccond step more steps of the main body the wing assembly sorry for the blur attached opposite wing both attached rear engine build the staffs i have mine set up differently than in the instructions i put one cone over the hump on one end of the staff and the other in the original spot then to load them onto the fighter all you do is push the original placed cone down and put it right in this way the staff looks better and it works the same see it slides right in skeletal parts of sides attached close up bottom both wings attached hidden missle launcher raised up another shot staffs attached complete side panel side pods complete swooshable finished time to complete 2hrs okay overall rating time price 910 could have been 4000 usd but due to new molds this is understandable parts 910 could have hade more dark red but thats imo plus i love dark red build time 810 i took my time on this and enjoyed the techniques the designers intricated also taking pics added to the time quite a bit playability 710 the main playability functions are the missle launchers in the back and the sliding cockpit my only gripe with these is they dont set right with the other slopes on the top also the inside of the cockpit is easily modded for regular size minifigs just pop a handlebar piece in the already provided arm in the cockpit and bam your favorite figs can have a ride it also helps keep the magnaguards in place if they hold it minifigs 1010 imo the new molds are great the only downfall is the right arm on both is less moveable due to the hard plastic turbanthing connected to the head swooshability 910 the starfighter is pretty sleek and very swooshable design 910 the most important aspect and this ones a winner its only a nine because it needs to have smoother edges in a few spots but they are easily modable overall score 87 i think its an awesome set very satisfying 2008 sw on dsr dsr edited by kimt 04 august 2008  1149 am indexed	positive

the coast guard quad because i live in the netherlands and we dont have the dino attack theme we have dino 2010 which have a diffrent quad so i would like to chose the dino attack one but as i dont one him goast guard though but i also dont have the coast guard one but i like him but i also dont have the coast quard one as well greets theforce edited by theforce 01 august 2008  1118 pm	positive
 that was a weird race anyway i love the look of both sets but ill have to go for the dino attack quad for a couple of reasons it is postapoc which i love features tan and dark red colours which are far more useful than yellow you get more bang for your buck with the dino set you get a little dino sure you can hate it but better than not having one right and the fig has much more useful pieces and a better face thanks for the face off thebrickster batbrick away	positive
ive got to go with the town one since you have to stand on the dino one steve	positive
i like the dino thingy because of the pieces and the dino is a lot of fun on its own i know thats akward	positive
dino attack quad for me no this isnt because i own it and not the other one but because i think just about everything is better in it  the design is better the colors are cooler and it has a better figure i dont like the figure in the coast guard quad at all  but since it was from world city im not suprised i also kinda like the dino actually its flexible and fits in with the previous dinos a lot better than the cruddy bigger ones with bright red yellow and green highlights	positive
ooooooh this is a very hard choicei like this new coast guard theme but i loved dino attackthe dino attack set has a weird looking gunbut imo the coast guard set lookscleaner if you get what i meanthe little dinolizard thing is practically worthless thats why i have a bin full of those little guysi want to keep liking dino attack i just cantso i know your like just get to the point already so i guess i have to go with coast guard thebrickster on aug 3 2008 0941 am said i did not know that europe had a different quad or at least one without the bazooka interesting that the gun was removed from the european sets or added to the us sets i sort of like the chain i also notice a big difference in the boxart destroyed city to prehistoric volcano i wonder if the story was different as well thanks for sharing a good picture  well it does look like the dino quad has the upper hand almost double the votes wow i would have so much wanted the european one more than the us one i mean that bazooka or as they called it a sonic screamer looks very silly	positive
price 569 kr minifigs 2 pieces 592 stickers 9 my sticker sheet wasn’t curled up overview before i start i will apologize for the bad quality of the pictures it is getting dark here right now so some of the pictures are a bit dark 1 minifigs the set comes with two of the new clone wars clone troopers which in my opinion are pretty cool it also comes with two short blasters and a bag of clone accessories figs with helmets figs without helmets 2 the tank this thing is huge 25cm long and 22cm wide and far oversized in my opinion but looks great nonetheless i very much like the white and dark red color scheme mixed with a bit of lime green even though there is no lime green bricks   left side right side back side both of the wings contain a hidden compartment to store the blasters and a part that rotates to reveal three flickfire missiles the front opens up as well to reveal the engine the side guns and the gun on the top rotate inside the cockpit is space for two figs one seated in front of two computer screens and one placed in a moveable seat which moves up and down allowing the fig to pop up the top hatch and staying hidden while the hatch is closed this function is triggered by opening the backdoor hidden compartment and missiles engine top hatch openclosed interior 3 rating build 910 not much to say here minifigs 710 an extra fig or two would have been great eventually a jedi or a commando design 810 this only looses a couple of points for being oversized but it’s a great looking model parts 1010 at 592 parts this is one of the cw sets with the best partsprice ratio price 810 sure this thing is great but i think its overpriced at 569 kr approx 120 when build it feels more like a 450 kr set final verdict 910 despite some flaws this thing is definitely recommended and it looks great on your shelf too 	positive
i know it would really go well with the rgs but it is not enough for £50 ill wait for the sales at christmas	negative
nice review  for portugal it costs 60€ i also consider it oversized it shold be the third of that size portugal and spain may have good prices but 90€ for the v19 must be a tippo	negative
finally a review of this thanks 120 bucks this tank looks tiny and though its amazingly detailed it should have been smaller and only 4050 bucks at most it just doesnt play that big a part man good pieces and mechanisms but no ones going to both buying a 120 buck tank no offence not unless it its the atte	negative

thank you for the first ever review of the fighter tank i like this set and every features it offers but i think that the engine could have a better look than just four green cylinders in a grey piece	negative
must buy now totally sweet not available in canada yet well designed and cheap for clone wars im going to mod it so that it looks like the imperial version	positive
i am 100 going to get this set it should be about 55 and if it is ill get it without a doubt i just hope that this set is 5060 if it isnt then we have a problem	positive
thanks for posting the review i’ve been wondering about this set to me it does feel a bit fig light for £50 i’d expect maybe one or two more clones i’m not to sure about the oversized issue it seems to me it’s better to have something a bit to large and have a better level or features than something smaller will less	negative
christian thanks for this outstanding review i have been waiting for this moment for someone to do up an excellent review like this republic fighter tank is my 2nd favourite set in my clone wars list the 2 clone troopers could be easily add up to your rgs since it offer only more trooper however i felt that this set is quite overpriced in fact all clone war sets are very expensive the fighter tank has a very great color combination of red and white to represent the republic the wheels below is the most impressive feature which enable the hovering feel the hatch is a neat feature as well however i noticed there is a rubber band within the control panel may i know what is it for i really enjoy viewing this review you had given the insight which will eventually determined whether to get it any sooner or later pr0visorak on aug 2 2008 0535 pm said this set costs a s100 in singaporei went to hng kong too see lego and the shops there are more expensive by a few dollarshoweveri went to australia before and everything there is the same price but when there is a sale it becomes very cheap hello pr0visorak you are from singapore as well welcome to eurobricks i hope you will do an introduction to the rest of the members in this forum in singapore it cost sgd10000 in fact that was the promotional price therefore there is no further discount for it	positive
i personally think this is a great set but a little pricey i wish it was available in the us though	positive
good review i would get this set but sadly they dont have it anymore i wish they did to get those sweet figs the battle droid colors are sweet the only set with geonosians	neutral
thanks for the review i love these affordable little sets not so affordable now because of the cool figs but im going to have a look on ebay and bricklink right now just in case an army of tan red droids would look great maybe well see some if geonosia appears in the new seires somehow unlikely since the confederacy was defeated at the battle of geonosis i wish i could have bought this set when it came out but id just left university so i was super skint and had to miss all the epii sets now they all cost loads even in used condition at least now there has been a redesign of the gunship and atte from the clone wars series that i can buy	neutral
great review man doi wish i had those red droids im using the dell xps1 and holy crap is it clear those pics were beautiful	positive
vbbn the pics were 12 mega pixles which is quite a lot i think although i had to scale them down to 800x600 i used to dream that tlg would bring out these sets of the geonosis arena and you could join them together to make a massive arena but i doubt they would ever do that also look out for my forth coming reviews of 4500 snow speeder some tie fighter with a lul dv and gg wheel bike chase i have taken all the pics all i need to do is upload them also i would review the jango fetts slave 1 but i have customized it so much i dont really want to revert it back to its original state edited by skipper 24 02 august 2008  0718 pm	neutral
thanks for the review skipper this is one of my favourite sets i really like the colour scheme and the geonosians are awesome keep up the good work kimt	positive
i always thought this looked liek a cool set with lots of nice and sadly unique pieces unfortunately the only attack of the clones sets i got were the jedi starfighter and yoda vs dooku amazing sets but i would love to have owned them all id never really looked into this set very much so thanks for the review	positive
this is actually one of my favorite star wars sets awesome rare pieces and excellent construction geo figs are a plus too best of all its nice and cheap	positive
good review i really liked the detailed geonosians and i hope theyre in a later set so i can get more knowing lego theyll release a huge arena playset with a few geos and sand red droids so people will buy the set just for them jifel	positive

i am fairly confident that something involoving geonosis will be released in 2010 but any way i had this set  one of my first ones but i droped the ship and it blew up i found all the pieces but in never rebuilt the ship although i still have the figs ant the canon overall this set was above average in my opinion great review	positive
7263 tie fighter review parts 159 figs 2 price £2000 not sure my 2nd review today this set came out about the same time as the rots sets and included the first minifig to have a lul 1 box  manual this is the front of the box it has a try me slot for the lul vader a close up of the try me slot luckily i got mine form argos so no little kids have been playing around with it the manual cover im not quite sure why it has a pic of the figs on the front but it doesnt deface it so i dont mind random manual shot rots set preview at the back of the manual 2 general set and figs the contents of the set  the minifigs a normal tie pilot and the first ever lul fig dv also my only lul fig no helmets tie pilot torso the lul is made of 3 parts lighted up the led for the blade 3 the tie fighter just a pic of it cockpit with controls tie pilot sitting in the cockpit by the way the hinge brick is the wrong color it is supposed to be grey the cockpit shut i wonder why tlc never printed those cockpit glass things correctly jet out the back top plate has some nice printing 5 overall build 510 very repetitivewell the ships symmetrical minifigs 410 1 tie pilot which is okay but a lul vader he cant even fit in the ship design 610 strong but the wings are all wobbly if that makes sense i dont like the blue either parts 610 lots of blue grills thingys not much else but it got 6 because of the wings plates price 510 could have been more expensive at least it had 2 figs playability 110 cant do much as a stand alone set overall 410 there just isnt enough here it could at least have a better color scheme and instead of dv it could come with a stormie like the old one did	negative
thanks for the review i actually like the older tie better since it had a stand for the tie not really a fan of the lu figs either no matter  a tie is a tie and this is a must have fighter for any lego sw fan out there never can get enough ties except the tie advanced or vaders tiethey dont rock kimt	positive
great review really shows off the main aspects of the set wish i had picked up a tie when they were around dsr	positive
and now for something completely different tiny turbos belonging to the racers line when i saw 8147 bullet run on sh for half the price i couldn´t resist buying it we had a lot of fun celebrating a bagbuild at our event using the 8150 zx turbo of that theme so i knew what would expect me with this extended set price normal 4999€ now 2499€ well i paid 3499€ in a lego store but that´s another story bricks 796 minifigs  hey this is tiny turbos stupid stickers don´t ask or read further the open box reveals seven polybags some with more smaller polybags inside the instruction booklet 2 ramps and the sticker sheet of course i put all of the bags on the table and not on the floor hey tlc didn´t print this on the first page of the building instructions and you won´t see any piece callouts as well on the other hand this is not adifficult build so why show them still there is an inventory list of all bricks at the end of the instructions note the giant sticker sheet we all now the dss but that is a new kind of extra super large sticker sheet it holds 82 stickers more to that later on the build is quite basic the only nonconventional parts of the build were the two slammers and the most annoying part was fiddling the rubber band of the holder without destroying it bag 1 easy beginning building the lime car the limo and the two slammers nothing exciting about the lime car but the limo was neat it´s an 18 studs long car the normal racers are abot 10 studs long nice way to put the horns on the back the slammers mmmmh nice invention if they would actually do something they are supposed to give the tubros a kick in the butt to speed them up but the result is a 80 cm long run and that´s it i had expected more acceleration from the slammers but it´s also fun to play with the cars without slamming them bag 2 convoy time the tow truck and the fuel truck the tow truck is a great idea and a good addition to the set the cars are supposed to crash  how do they get back home well here´s the answer quite american layout of the truck and it´s very well done horns 5 flashing lights and a right color choice you can move the arm up and down and pull out the hook note the metallic silver antennae the fuel tank has got a secret function it may break on the middle of the trailer therefore it has a hinge build in the bottom city fire mayhem and there´s no fire engine bag 3 long longer how long can a tiny truck be the pipe truck an unexpected buggy and the red racer 36 studs long the pipe truck breaks every convention the cabin is almost the same like the tow truck and the fuel truck and that is the good part of it the trailer has to carry pipes and is functional as well as it can commute sidewarts it looks quite unrealistic as well and you cannot drive this beast on tiny roads good for another crash but there are more cars in this bag now this was a surprise a buggy this is the only 6wide car but just because the wheels are large monster truck madness i don´t care for those cars personally a disappointment i would have preferred another racer  for variety though did i say another racer here we are the red devil great looking a real fast shape and red the best racer in this set vrooommm this is the most played with car of the set not only from me  as you may have noticed i didn´t put any stickers so far i don´t like stickers especially when placed over two or more bricks and here you are supposed to do it several times of course the cars look better with stickers on but they are also great without stickers only the fuel truck looks boring without my sons didn´t know there were supposed to be stickers and they didn´t ask for them so everything is allright here´s a closeup of the sticker sheet did i already mention it was 82 stickers  the only exception i made using sticker was for bag 4 bag 4 you go here you pay the highway toll booth the only immobile part of the set but great to brake though the barriers that is fun i only put on stickers on 2x2 plates where i had the idea to use those plates further on on different other mocs this looks a bit boring without the other stickers i admit but still no cut off to the playability there are also two ramps belonging to the set these only make sense if you are able to speed up the racers with the slammers and hit the ramps correctly i had problems with that so they are on the shelves now could be a lot fun making a contest though like this picture of the inventories frontpage all cars put together the usual leftovers all in all this is a great set to call ones own i did not regret buying it especially when it was 50 off even normal price would not have been too much build great for smaller children boring to afols 510 special brickscolors none all basics 310 design i love the tiny turbos´ size and design 910 playability 1 because of the slammers another 1 because no minifigscale but that is not the intention of the set still 910 pricepiece ratio dang it´s not on sale any more but if you hurry you could still grab one in the lego stores 1010 all in all 8510 and a clear recommendation it was and still is a set to play with your children the size fits perfectly to matchbox cars and that was exactly what my younger son did can you find all of the cars included in the set ps after buying this set i won an ebay auction with another tiny turbos set  8135 bridge chase this is even more fun i will soon care for a review with some never seen phototricks as well stay tuned edited by whitefang 23 may 2009  0702 pm indexed	neutral
thanks for the review ill definately get this set sooner or later imo the tiny turbos are awesome i actually bought nearly every set so far built the models added the stickers and packed them away in ziplock bags in the attic sadly i dont have display room for them yet a fine set carwise dump the slammers and buildings into the spare bag and keep the cars kimt tiny turbos on	positive
thanks for the review i have quite a few ttstiny turbos i never got this one but if its on sale	positive
looks like a pretty good set with a some nice colors the spider is probably the best model in my opinion but i mean look at the wasp kinda weak it you ask me nice review 	positive
thanks for the review this is another good sw set a true classic i especially like the colourscheme of this set the rebel gun is crappy though but overall the set rocks kimt	positive
my review gave you motivation to build a set my review was better than i thought	positive
great review i bought this set when it came out but sold it a couple years later for some extra cash i have no regrets selling this one as i was never really impressed with it different story for the 4483 atat  oh how i wish i still had that one the snowspeeder was alright just didnt have any sort of wow factor to it the best part of the set is probably the rebel trooper looking at the last photo in your review looks like youre about to have a major battle in your hallway apart from the snowspeeder  motorized atat i see the arc170 fighter grievouss starfighter and is that a podracer i see  and what is the set with the treads its not star wars but looks like a pretty cool set maybe a mission mars vehicle	positive
skipper 24 on aug 4 2008 1252 pm said podracer not sure where you got that from i didnt have them out i noticed the minifig between the grievous starfighter  the moddino2010 vehicle and it looked like a little person sitting in the pod of his podracer guess my eyes are playing tricks on me  my eyesight is shot  my wife keeps pushing me to go visit the optometrist	neutral
nope there is a guy sitting there hes there because on dine 2010 there were no guns like on dino attack so so i made a big gun like on the dino attack set i can see where you got the pod racer idea from now	neutral
i find myself so stupid i didnt bought this set it was 30 euro and i thought that it would be for sale after a half year it was with earlier sw sets also nice review	positive
this is one of my favorite sw sets it is a good size to the hoth base and the atat	positive
7255 general greivous wheel bike chase review parts 111 figs 2 price £1000 the first set to include gg 1 general set and minifigs not manual because i dont have it the contents of the box after being built both minifigs the set includes 5 lightsabers my own design gg ggs cape on the outside ggs cape on the inside 2 the wheel bike front view standing on legs side view gg cant hold the controls because of his arms roller mode the legs are a bit to chunky so to roll it has to be tilted forward 3 boga the lizard grey tip to the tail the front back and saddle split in to three sections 4 overall build 410 there isnt really much to build minifigs 910 it comes with gg with the special cape and obiwan in rots gear which is hard to find i think design 510 not really to scale but otherwise okay apart from boga which just looks like any old dinosaur also the controls on the wheel bike arent really right parts 610 comes with some dark green bricks and lots of rods  the guns on the wheel bike the boga feet are also nice price 810 £10 for 2 figs isnt bad it could have a few more parts though playability 1010 you can easily recreate the movie scenes with this set overall 710 it would be better if the bike and boga were more to scale and more accurate as well as the set having more parts	neutral
i had this set £15 rrp actually  and agree mostly with your review although on the wheel bike itself two legs can be placed at the front end and two at the back to enable it to roll properly boga is very juniorised and the set itself is very simple and contains many large pieces the minifigures are good though i traded my gg however  just to offer my personal thoughts build 510 minifigs 1010 parts 310 price 710 playability 1010 overall 710  not an average tk	neutral
kimt on aug 3 2008 0322 pm said not one of my favourite sw sets kinda boring and the set is poorly designed imho we do get the general but thats not nearly enough thanks for the reivew and fine pics kimt gg has a capea custom cape what more do you want	negative
thanks again skipper for producing yet another review to go into the index i like this slave1 but sadly i must admit that i like the really old version better boba fetts slave1 that is even though is grossly undersized i think its better than this one belonging to his father jango kimt	neutral
i have all three of the slave i ships and i agree with kimtalthough it is a very small compact ship the first slave i boba fett is still the sturdiest the newest slave i boba fett is not bad and is of much better construction than this slave i from jango fett even though i like the size and scale of the jango slave i and the newest boba fett slave iwhen you pick that very first one up it had the feeling ofyou can throw me against the wall drop me off the roof of your house or let 4 two year olds play with meim not gonna break at least thatss my opinion good review	positive
i never got the original boba fetts slave 1 i wish they would make one to scale with the minifigures i would be so cool i am also putting up a review of the clone turbo tank probably tomorrow it is a different variation to the one in the index edited by skipper 24 03 august 2008  0712 pm	neutral
personally i hated that set i fell apart way to easily and was just not built well	negative
thanks for the review it looks like an interesting set even if not as good as bobas skipper 24 on aug 3 2008 0811 pm said i never got the original boba fetts slave 1 i wish they would make one to scale with the minifigures i would be so cool you mean it would be so cool i agree that it would be if they made a large minifig scale version like with the ucs millenium falcon i would probably try to buy that edited by shoc 03 august 2008  0831 pm	neutral
nice review i will say i like the latest slave i the best as it is longer than jangos i havent seen the first one so i cant really comment	neutral
that was indeed a set that never appealed to me its build was just plain wrong and awful i only bought it because i found it on clearance at around 15€ and they had 4 of them if i had known better then id have bought all 4 seeing how much that jango fett minifig is worth now  but i ended up heavily modifying it in its propoions and now it looks ok next to the new slave one which is the best one of its 3 incarnations i think	negative
very good review i have he newest slave i and i like it more than this one dsr	neutral
okay i have fixed that pic thanks oky wan i have modified this but then yesterday i built it back to its original state to review it	neutral
you added some decals to the jango figure right  they seem to be suffering a little i remember buying this set from the discount tent after my first visit to legoland windsor i wasnt sure whether to buy it even in their sale  but i was glad i did once id built it 	neutral
yep those decals are suffering i am going to apply some new ones now with proper paper	neutral
i really want one of these if only it wasnt expensive i probably wont buy it because itd be scraped for parts too quick great review though	neutral
a very nicely done review i remember getting this slave i  it was my first large star wars set	positive
this set looks liek a good buy for 4 wish it was still around but like you said it needs accessories	positive
manta on aug 3 2008 1033 am said wish it was still around even though little sets 10 like the new coast guard 4wd  jet and the quad are great little city sets lego seems to be returning to good quality small sets with their latest city lineup metalandi on aug 3 2008 1046 am said i remember having this set actually i even still have it at least the pars are somewhere  when i was a child and i used it for making races as it is there for you should look for them and resurrect it it really feels good after youve found all the pieces and put a set back together again as it was when you first bought it	positive
this little set really makes my point small playable inspiration to build the set into a few other models great set i wish i had it my town is going to need more vehicles i really miss main model instructions with alternate build ideas	neutral
i can prodly say i own this little bugger its not much but it is a nice addition to the series they are also easy to build so you can get a rally going quite fast stauder	neutral
i hate how the original release had the lightup windu which was really lame and one less clone trooper i bought it when it first came out so missed out on a good windu and another clone trooper	neutral
did your version without the lul mace have trans blue grill things like the ones on the back of the speeder  or was my set a one off	neutral
i got the original version of this set with the luls mace windu figure when tlc released the nonluls version i managed to swap  they sent me the new version and a clone trooper iirc and i mailed them back the old version this was a great set the suspension worked great and it rolled magnificently nice review with good photos but again your price is a little off £6999 is the rrp unless the price you paid was £80 tk	positive
good set but its flimsy as sin but that may have been my rush job building it mine got shoved off a bed oh and i lost my light up mace  propably somewhere within the blue bin o doom™ aka the brick bucket™ or blocknull™  edited by maiq the liar 04 august 2008  1015 pm	neutral
nice review again skipper i passed on this one because of the price but its a nice set good for you for getting the newer version with nonlul mace and an extra clone that purple blade sure is a beauty the tank itself is alright just an atat on wheels in my opinion the turret is great though and so is the speeder bike i didnt realize that the jet pack had two nailguns harpoon guns on it i thought that the nailgun was a new piece but the jetpack is very cool	positive
the kid on aug 4 2008 0820 am said i got the original version of this set with the luls mace windu figure when tlc released the nonluls version i managed to swap  they sent me the new version and a clone trooper iirc and i mailed them back the old version this was a great set the suspension worked great and it rolled magnificently nice review with good photos but again your price is a little off £6999 is the rrp unless the price you paid was £80 tk that was a great idea i never even thought to send it back and get the new one with the other clone and the non lul windu	positive
6701 space minifigures review set 6701 set name space minifigures released 1983 pieces 36 including minifigs minifigs 6 brickshelf gallery peeroncom bricklink bricksetcom introcomment as i reignited my love for classic space a few years ago i decided to start hunting sets i didnt have this small one fell into my lap very cheap with box and minifigs in great condition so now ive resized the pics and done the review and no i am not envious of this forumreallyim not the box the box is pretty neat it has a very comfortable size compared to modern boxes and the back of it shows what you get i like the way they tlg split the minifigs and arranged everything neatly front rear sadly the box has seen better days but its age taken into consideration i think its just fine the figs a fine collection of red white and yellow space figs some great accesories to go as well not much more to say except this was a great armybuilderset a true must have for most classic space fans the verdict its kinda hard rating this set since its a minifig supplemental set no design or colourscheme to comment on it has a lot of playability since figs will always come in handy when buildingplaying with your space sets kimt	positive
thanks for the review kimt i gave this above average i believe i had this one but it was so long ago im still a bit freaked out by the yellow ones when i emerged from my dark ages i kept thinking gee i miss the people packs but now that i have over 500 minifigures i dont feel that way anymore even so i wish they would rerelease some of the classic old ones	neutral
i voted above average as well but back in 1983 i would have probably gone much lower sadly i wasnt as interested in minifigs at the time i appreciated the ones i had but i really just wanted ships or bases and would have gladly passed this by for something with one or two figures and a small moon rover i skipped all of the classic minifig sets space castle and town it was only upon coming out of my dark ages that i went minifig crazy for me this is above average because of the accessories without them its an average set with a small brick built droid or a rover it would be outstanding that said id buy at least 10 copies now though id rather have a 4 figure set with one of each colour including blue i never had blue back then i think castle lured me away thanks for an interesting review it gives me a chance to further explore why i changed from shipset to minifig fan and bore all of eb with it	neutral
i wonder why this set had no blue or black astronauts whatever the case i always loved the small minifig sets that lego released as i could never get enough astronauts my favorite was the set of futuron astronauts why would the yellow astronauts freak you out sinner is it because they look nekkid 	neutral
pretty nice set but the newer minifig packs had greater variety in both the figures and equipment my favorite one among all of them is 6704 which is also the only instance of both blacktrons appearing in one set quote i wonder why this set had no blue or black astronauts whatever the case i always loved the small minifig sets that lego released as i could never get enough astronauts my favorite was the set of futuron astronauts i think the blue and black guys hadnt yet been released at the time of this set	positive

thanks for the review simonjedi this just reaffirms that the v19 is my highest priority this fall behind the rgs of course is that new printed piece a 2 x 2 tile it looks like an excellent detail part for mocing those black pieces used on the landing gear look very bioniclelike if they havent been used before id suspect they will be not that im a bionicle expert or anything it is a shame that this set only includes one clone that seems to be the only drawback to the set everything else looks spot on	positive
the printed part isnt new it came with 10178 motorized atat walker also nice review i would get the set if it was a little cheaper or came with more than 1 fig whyhas it got 2 instruction books the set isnt particularly big	neutral
thanks for the review ive added it to the index and added a poll in which members can vote their opinion on this set i think this is a very good set i like the colours and the very playable feature that allows the wings to lock in attack formation now all i need is to buy this baby edit i gave it an above average rating since its well designed looks sturdy and fits the sw theme sets perfectly	positive
nice review simon jedi the v19 has been one of my favourite ships since the release of cwa and this is one of the sets ive been considering most about buying its great to see tlgs treatment of it it looks like no expense was spared making it as aesthetically and functionally accurate as possible  though i think the cockpit windshield could maybe have been slightly bigger but thats just me im sure it looks pretty big compared to other starfighters too did it take a long time to build	positive
great review simonjedi  i really like that you included lots of photos of your build i put together my v19 torrent last night and i was surprised by how heavy the completed ship is it has some real heft once its finished wow it is a really cool ship i was disappointed that the central wing doesnt really lock into place once it flips down it just kind of droops there so i attached a technic pin to the locking arm so it could plug into the 2x4 brick thats on the underside of the starfighter this brick can be seen in your photo of the bottom of the ship overall the build is one of the more confusing that ive seen i had to dismantle and rebuild the first engine after i realized id left out a piece and i kept thinking of the poor 7yearold that gets this set as hisher very first lego set ever	negative
the v19 was my first tcw set i buyed it when i was visiting my father i just wanted to build it there and i do so but how do you will get sthbig like this with in the train so i had to destroy him when i was still home again i had to build it 3 times because the mechanic dont works i only can say that the v19 is one of the best tcw sets thanks to you for the review simonjedi  i just wanted to make one in german but now i neednt to make it	positive
pedro on aug 5 2008 1229 pm said it looks pretty big compared to other starfighters too did it take a long time to build it took me 3 and a bit hours to build it although i had some problems with the technic and i had to take pictures during the build	neutral
thanks for this excellent review simonjedi  this looks like an awesome set and this is the set i am most looking foward just as well as the separatist spider droid 7681 	positive
the ability for it to fold in and out of attack position has wowed me this is my top priority now thanks for making up my mind	positive
hydraulic wings i am very impressed and am now considering getting this set purely because of this funciton i am just curious as to know why are there sand green parts on the bottom of the v19 is it visible when the model is completed i am also pleased to see tlc giving us a printed cockpit computer this time around	positive

actually we should care that theres only one fig in it since its kind of expensive though thats my opinion  but the ship is really awesome  its too bad theres not a battlepack that includes clone pilots edited by bricklanta 30 november 2008  0615 am	neutral

i love this set and i gave it outstanding i might note though that the cylinder is just there as a dampener when disenegaged the wing function still works just not as smoothly interestingly though the cylinder is an old piece i have a few others its just that this is the first time its been used without a spring i had no problems assembling this set	positive
i voted outstanding this is simply an amazingly good looking train and comes with indeed 11 minifigs i sold this one because i need a budget to build my ship but i kept one because i love it not bad for a first review ruben	positive
thanks for the edit hinckley its my first poll and review and i wasnt quite sure if i got it right maiq the liar on aug 5 2008 1220 am said but seriously why is there a civilian train stop in a cave did 1 too many people get lost playing zork yeah i also wondered why the included timetable includes not only real life cities instead of brick ones even more so since the train track just goes round d	neutral
oh ruben you lucky so and so this set is one of the most beautful i have ever seen splendid looking build and 11 figures all the same faces like but still you get that old woman pigtail head piece which is just great i thought you meant the monorail set when you told me about this but guess i was wrong dont laugh ive been away from lego for quite some time and for 80 euros it was a real bargain from a great friend really nice review hope this sets brings you years of joy	positive
cool review i actually have two of these i got one for christmas when it was rereleased in 2003 and another one in a charity shop a few months later for €5 i love the minifigs even if they all have smileys and having two sets of them can really fill up a town	positive
im not normally that big into trains but this set has a real coolness factor that sets it apart from most of the others the color scheme is the same one that amtrak and many local subway systems use i picked it up along with the club car expansion when they were rereleased in 2001 i have made various modifications to mine rearranging the car layouts and adding a second train motor into the rearmost car along with another set of lights so that both ends light up as you said it would be great to have an 8stud version of this so you could fit in two rows of seats side by side that might make a nice mod project at some point	positive
outstanding train set the legend of the entire train series is the metroliner this is a super 5 set the color design minifigs is just so perfect and lovely it resemble the trains which we see on our rails in our daily life i cant find any flaws on this at all the only flaw i noticed is my mistake of not able to buy this set at all in fact i had never seen this set in the shops before in my entire life thebrickster on aug 5 2008 0923 am said how cool is that and 11 minifigs  when was the last time lego included 11 figs in a single set there is another set fufil the criteria above which is also a well known legend it has 12 minifigs which is the 10159 city airport aka century skyway airport	positive
ahh the good old train theme how i wish tlg would make such great trains today now that the quality of city sets has improved so much that really brings back memories even if i didnt have this one but a cargo train that came out about the same time period maybe plus a few years i dont have any trains myself at the moment mostly because im afraid i havent got enough space to put in on display with all the rails and stuff	positive
really nice train i always wished tlg would have made the passenger ir train longer and maybe used some of the nice features of this train i still love that faucet piece	positive
this is a great review of a great set hairy ruben i voted for outstanding since the only thing you can say about this train set is that it is outstanding it has been the best passenger train in all the time from legos beginning on until now i bought the rereleased version of it in 2003  and i really really do not regret it klausdieter	positive
i also voted outstanding for the simple reason that ive owned this set for a long time but for most of the time its been an anonymous heap of bricks mixed with all the other bricks i have so about a year ago i started rebuilding it and it now sits proudly next to also rebuilt 2150 on my shelf imo its an excellent set best of the 9v passenger trains no doubt and it combines the best of the 80s trains with that of the 90s  its not some futuristic panoramaglassed lowslung train but an honest realisticlooking train that captures many of the features that passenger trains used to and in some cases still have	positive
i dont like the set and i do like the set the reason why i like it it looks good the reason why i hate it this train was the first train for the new 9v system and it means to me the end of the beautiful 12v series for this last reason i own this set i voted average only strange they named it metroliner in holland when we speak of a metro i need to think at short distance trains only used in big cities like rotterdam and your minifigs at pic aint right according the instruction 	neutral
my favourite favourite favourite old set its too bad i was born 2 years after its release i would have had a major interest in classic town i might actually get this one on bricklink not that itll go for a good price ill only buy if it does you see an outstanding a highly useful and wellmade set that really just stands out from its counterparts edit nevermind edited by dovchenko 16 august 2008  1025 am	positive

i never got this set i spent a long time after one christmas trying to get and failed miserably admittedly i was much younger then it has however remained one of my most sought after items but i’ve still never got around to getting one the set generally makes me rather nostalgic for a time when the trains were painted in simple liveries like that one anyway it seems an excellent set from what i’ve seen and the figure selection is amazing i hope lego produce something as good as this when the new trains are released next year	positive
outstanding set and review thanks for presenting it ive had this since it first came out but didnt think it would be that impressive so i didnt bother opening it now im tempted aside from the slight size issue i cant find anything here to gripe about except for the limited availability i want 5 i think that makes me a parts monkey eek eek youre exactly right about this selling like mad its another one of those missed opportunities for tlg sure its nice to get people to subscribe by offering it as part of brickmaster but in the long run put it in the stores for 6 and sell a million just give us indys manbag we need it for postal employees and such as is the running joke whenever i comment on one of your reviews id give this a solid 985 not out of anything just 985 or in clearer terms  12 though i voted 5	positive

this set easily is above average for me i had this as a little child and whenever any of my relatives came to visit us they brought me some lego usually it was either this set or 6844 the really nice thing about this set are the alternate builds for the low price you got a nice range of parts and cool ideas what to build with them you could build a fleet of rovers or the alternates and everytime it was huge fun 	positive

thanks for this review if youd only know what memories you brought back i think i remember this set better than any other i had when i was a child some time after i got it i decided to disassemble it and combine it with the jeep from 6552 rocky river retreat it came out pretty good though as it became the main attraction point of my town beeing the car of my favourite minifig back then and and and looong story  i kept it assembled that way from this day on until earlier this year when i finally disassembled it because i needed the parts edited by metalandi 06 august 2008  0357 am	positive

great review brickster why exactly did the outback adventure etc themes never quite catch onjust a thought what a great set i wish i had it but in 1997 i was just back from my whirl wind trips around the world and had drifted away from lego i dont know why but i will say this i love the actual suspension that came with this set and the trains sets i have been trying to buy up as much of it as i can and now i see i need to add one more set to the i need to get that	positive

thebrickster on aug 7 2008 0406 pm said at leat you were able to pick up two of the sets do you still have them andor the pieces yes i have the parts the manuals and even one of the boxes unforutunaltey the parts are mixed in a big pile of parts as i never had any time to sort out my parts you can see i used the yellow doors here decals applied the great thing about the copter was it had 2 suitcases which as far as i can tell aint a common part not rare but still nice to have and it had the guy with the green jacket the winch wasnt bad either the only flaw was it was a standard lego copter meaning similar ones where avalible in quite a few sets do you plan to review it staudie	neutral
nice review of an interesting set but i have a query anyone know why it is actually called amazon crossing when its meant to be in australia also the amazon runs through a jungle anyway edited by shoc 10 august 2008  0344 pm	positive
oh i loved this set when i was young i think i got it for my birthday and it was one of my favourite sets at the time funnily enough i was thinking about it the other day and how i really should build it again thanks for the nostalgic review	positive
ok this is the big one the controversial one the one everyone either hates or defends what do i think read on the figs bandana man masked dude dude with shades good figures i miss scarface comes with his torso though which is my favorite the one with the ammo strap across the chest one figure short of the figuretoprice value but we can deal with that the dino the dino its the one that comes with the chopper in green any questions the tank and so it begins i think it looks a lot better in person than on the box the left side good time to mention that the treads run pretty easily and this is a very playable set right side keep an eye on that flap in the center  and we have a folding ladder the back probably the weakest point of the set apart from the dino the turret turned and tilted the mechanism works extremely well and the gun seems to work better than others for some reason or maybe it just seems that way the front of the cockpit im at a loss trying to figure out how those tiny windshields defend them against 40foot mutant tyrannosaurus rexes with radioactive breath laser eyes and what have you anyway another one of those neat steering wheels some viking horns and some stickered control panels oh yeah this set has a good amount of stickers probably around 20ish the back of the cockpit i love the little gun it turns 360 degrees and tilts up oh yeah and those green barrels theyve been using are awesome i can think of tons of uses for them the verdict 7610 playability 9410 pieces 7510 figures 8810 dino 310 value 410 the main downfall of this set is the price i would easily pay 30 for this no questions asked but 40 was a hard sell for me  i gave in merely to see what i would think of it and also to help you guys find out the same this is a great display set and a great play set the pieces are good  lots of nice blay beams used in the construction but the price people thats the killer pick this up only if you have everything else or you find it on clearance and thus ends my dino attack review series hope you enjoyed them until next time bloody jay	neutral
tks for the review once more jay  i totally agree with you jay  this set has very nice details suche as the mini gun movable ladder green barrels and great figs  however it is very expensive for what it is and i dont think there are that many very usefall parts in there  well i could use those treads  if i ever buy this set its really not for the design which i totally dislike	positive
quote i would easily pay 30 for this no questions asked but 40 was a hard sell for me is it easier for you to eat if you know that this would cost you around 60 if you live in denmark 	negative
bloody jay on aug 5 2005 0115 pm said the back of the cockpit i love the little gun it turns 360 degrees and tilts up oh yeah and those green barrels theyve been using are awesome i can think of tons of uses for them what uses might these be	positive
dinobot wrote quote youre luckythey sell those for 60 heream i getting ripped off only if you think you are this set isnt too bad in the playability factor its not that great though a better cockpit and some more armour to this treaded monster is needed thanks for another great review bloody jay and i agree that this set isnt worth the price though the ark 170 is still my least favorite badly priced set graynar	negative
nice review cobra thanks for sharing i think arctic was one of those neat themes that never really took off i like these little polybag sets as they make great startersintroduction sets for themes or serve as a nice supplement or addon to an existing collection ive always liked the thick green hood piece used in the arctic theme and have thought about using it in a sw hoth scene in any case nice review ive got an arctic set that i built recently and will share a review soon	positive

i got this yesterday on sale only 5500 yen60 american and was a little disappointed id avoided it but all the new sets are at least a month away here it looks a little weird in photo and the actual build is worse just a flat little disc with a cockpit only special points for the color which will probably just look better with those 2009 sets	negative

emergency evac set  6445 theme town resq year released 1998 piece count 97 minifigs 1 list price 8 usd in 1998 lego introduced a new theme called resq the theme was really a quasicoast guard subtheme of classic town the theme included boats helicopters emergency vehicles and even a water hovercraft most notable was the black and yellow color combination that predominated the sets i only picked up a couple of sets from the theme including this emergency evacuation vehicle that i consider a van i never got into the theme but looking back at these sets i have gained a better appreciation for their value in classic town lets take a look at 6445 in greater detail starting with the box the back of the box providing a few alternate models and similar imagery on the instructions the set includes one small sheet of decals for the van 6445 has one resq minifig that i find pretty nice i like the neon orange reflectors he has a nice printed backside with the word resq prominently displayed this little set includes an abundance of tools a black walkietalkie is not pictured heres the emergency van i like the back section that has a nice winch with turning wheel and a few hooks for tools heres the minifig pulling the grappling hook for some resq action this is my favorite part of this set the van isnt too fancy but has some neat features while i like the blue windshield piece for maybe space sets im not really fond of its use for the van the van has no steering wheel but rather two levers for steering on the top of the vehicle are two emergency alarms and some extra lights the back of the van has a large opening piece that allows wide access to the back section it comfortably fits a long gurneystretcher heres the driver resting on the gurney he should never have tried to pick up the gurney without a 2nd resq minifig and a shot of the back section without the gurney lastly a picture of the complete set final thoughts resq is really a neat theme that has great play value for kids while its not one of my more favorite town subthemes it does offer some nice pieces and an abundance of black and yellow pieces i think a few of the resq sets go nicely with the divers theme released one year earlier in 1997 i had a chance to purchase the largest set of the theme 6479 emergency response center at half the price but passed back in the late 90s id be interested in finding out what other eb members think of this set and the resq theme	positive
wow and people complain that a military type line would be to violent here we have half dead soilders and a space shuttle bombing people with severed skeleton heads i have to say this is the first time ive heard of this theme i like the colors as most have pointed out the base plate is preety cool two could use it to moc up some garages	positive
i am a proud owner of this set like others i got it discounted and couldnt resit the parts pack this is the type of lego sets that bothers me when you look at it now youd be tempted to say hey not bad but at the same time some years ago it wasnt good enough to buy it full price i was kinda disappointed because usually sets using that kinda baseplates are excellent castle paradisa and this one is just ok one really minus point would be the lack of any opponent faction in the set	negative
thats it thanks for the review but now you make me want to build my own one thanks a lot on a more serious note i really like this set and have always wished to aquire it i have two broken tie interceptors so this should be a easy build and as someone in the pirate forum i think said it would be a great baseplate for building cave to hide the booty thanks pmg and welcome	positive
thanks for the review pmj  i like the play value in this set even if i don´t own it  the way the orbs are put into the rocket is awesome and i really like it but at the end the set have some lack of detail 	neutral
another outstanding review by the awesome set reviewer i enjoyed reading this review very much and i felt that you have redress twilight in an approriate manner i have very mixed feeling about this set especially with its design it seemed i will need to watch the clone wars movie in the theatre before i compared with it most of the time when this lego set is used in a movie you will tend to compare it and what is the actual purpose for twilight same as the rest of the sw vehicles and aircraft for a high price like this i can actually top up a little more and get the atte with the same batch of minifigs plus commander rex if there is a special figure such as the v19 torrent clone pliot it will be a much ideal scenario at the moment i have not bring in any clone war sets into my collection and i am quite sure twilight is not in my priority list especially when i am not a fullpledged star war collectors or i have strong intentions to complete the entire range in this recent release therefore i need to prioritise my purchase and likely to get two rgs since that is my favourite ship in clone war era i am not comparing it with rgs both sets defintely have their pros and cons oh i love that postcard you made certainly looks very nice sveltecorps thanks for doing up this superb detailed review which had given twilight the neccessary attention it should have	neutral
darkrebellion on aug 12 2008 1217 pm said i like this ship even if it looks so bulky but i need to buy first other sets so maybe this beast will be landing in my collection the next year or this one if i am lucky  i can just ask for something can you post a pic of all your clone wars sets together with this one all the sets in one pic not many pics with this an each set  please  i think a lot of people feel the same way  there was so much good stuff to get in the first wave that this is probably a backburner set for a lot of people and some are probably waiting to see the movie to see how prominently it features i will try and take a pic with some other cw sets i dont have all of them though and some need to be reassembled as i built them on holiday and then had to pack them away i do think this line of sets has been the best sw lego wave released though all of the recent releases have been amazing in their own way	neutral
thanks for the review now i thinnk i will buy this set btw i really like what you did to the back i might do the same to mine	positive
wow certainly much bigger than i would have thought thanks for the great review and pictures  well for some reason i was drawn to this set but with the lack of interior and quite a bit of technics i think ill pass or at least get the atte first thanks again	neutral
i read the visual guide recently and learned a bit more about the twilight i wont get into spoilers but it seems that the ship becomes a sort of endearing family van for the characters which is neat big bulky uncool but it gets you from one place to another if it factors into more than just the 90 minute film i may pick this up it seems that theres room for a lot of personality in this ship once you see the film it is a corellian freighter smuggling spice for the hutts thats cool right	neutral

thanks a lot for a very nice and entertaining review your photos were really nice and there have been some reviews lately that have such blurry pics cough cough it was a pleasure to see you can 1 put lego bricks together 2 write a review 3 handle your camera i think this ship is underrated it is really nice i love the playing features like landing gear and back door perhaps just cause i had to get along with so called landing gears in the past that did not work at all 7140 for example and i simply love that there is space inside you said there is not really some cause of the landing gear mechanism but it seems it should be easily fixed do you think there is enough space to put some plates over the landing gear and add some beds kitchen und tv i think this set is so perfect to mod it into a clone wars mobile home your back garden ist just perfect for this i prefer this over the atte and over a 2nd gunship thanks a lot for the review	positive
zzz on aug 12 2008 0900 pm said and i simply love that there is space inside you said there is not really some cause of the landing gear mechanism but it seems it should be easily fixed do you think there is enough space to put some plates over the landing gear and add some beds kitchen und tv i think this set is so perfect to mod it into a clone wars mobile home your back garden ist just perfect for this it does have that homely feel there is room inside with technic beams to lay plates etc on the only issue is that its kind of fiddly to access you could do it from either the side door or rear door though maybe move that tow line at the back i have to say it is a set that grows on you	positive
sveltecorps on aug 12 2008 0219 am said hmm dior i can smell it now the ship doesnt look too swooshable but then again more than the heavy rgs i really like that review svelte corps so much detail unfortunately i would only get this if it was a very low price like in a sale	neutral
thanks for yet another awesome review quote seems like tlc has done a pretty accurate representation of the ship the real fault for the ships messy design has to go to lucasfilm not tlc my guess is lucasfilm is trying to recapture that what a piece of junk magic of the millennium falcon i guess well have to wait to see the movie to see if they succeeded or not this sums up my opinion exactly i can easily admit that the design of the kit is spot on  but unfortunately the actual design of the ship in the new movie is garbage actually despite the millennium falcons odd design i really think its a pretty appealing ship  and its really cool i cant say the same for the twilight though	negative

thanks for the review i for one will get this set i collect and therefore i need it i vision something like this a i buy the set b i built the set c pics for my bs account d set taken apart sad but true its not much but super for parts i agree from what your review showed me that this set is a little too much technic a thing thats been invading our beloved brick built sets in the past years i really have no need for a retractable front or functioning landing gear what i need is a kickass ship with neat design and cool interior the twilight does not offer that look at the size of that thing	negative

good review there my daughter loves the backyard garden of the twilight my opinion of the ship has changed after reading this thanks	positive
having plenty of time on my hands this summer i did some reviews yes im aware this has already been done but ill just do it once more no harm there set 5615 set title the knight price 299 euro  349 usd pieces 21 yes a whole 21 bricks release 2007 the box a neat little box that has a great size for dropping into your shopping cart for once tlg didnt shove the bricks into an oversized cardboard box  the knight this is a great minifig though he looks a little unsatisfiedmight be because his head isnt put on all the way a great army builder fig the only thing that i find a little annoying is that the collar isnt completely rounded it looks too much like an animation and lefthand work the weapon rack yes thumbs up for this plate mail sword shield and jousting helmet plus the spear and open helmet on the fig so many great additions to put into use bring it on pesky skeleton army the all in all verdict a great set a little too expensive compared to the crossbow attack in which one gets 2 knights and a skeleton plus bricks for 549 euro  599 usd but still a great army builder set and the 7090 set does not have the same knight fig kimt	positive
very good set indeed the possibility to alter the knights appearance hugely boosts the value very smart thinking of tlc got one of these so far but if i ever do a castlerelated comic or animation this will be the set i buy tons of	positive
this is an awesome set in my opinion i scraped my crossbows for mocing recently but the set is still an amazing army builder for the price for the sw battlepacks which have 4 minifigs and a cheap vehicle you get 4 knights  this is 2 sets to equal the price of a bp  2 skellys and 2 skelly horses plus 4 crossbows 4 good wheels and some other good dark blue and brown pieces for my ever expanding castle town great buy	positive
another small set my local target doesnt have they dont have the best castle selection they only really have dwarven mines and castle seiges ill buy this if i see it there though because it looks like a great little set i could use the awesome knight and a skeleton that has a regular body so he looks like he is in armor	positive

this set is a great little bundle the kitted out knight skellie knight weapons and the few bricks for the fence and weapon rack the castle 07 barding here is very nice indeed the colour scheme of the new castle guys is great imo the light blue and blue work nicely together and against the grey background i dont really like the pearl grey helmet  it would be nicer in metallic silver like the visor i think interesting comment re the skellie helmet  i guess black normal knights helmet with visor would be quite nice for him i got this set as part of the complete castle collection from sh however i have extras of all the smaller sets and skeleton tower except i dont have another one of this set its on my list of sets to buy unfortunately it wasnt on sh for ireland when i was making later orders  quite an odd omission also last year castle 07 was exclusive to argos uk catalogue retailer who only had three sets not the joust i should see if the local toy store has it now though as they did stock some 07 castle in addition to 08 at the start of the year i think small sets like this should be well stocked in shops for a year or two  it surely doesnt do their sales much good to be so sporadically available sorry turned into a bit of a ramble anyways the point is that this set is good enough id pick up another the cobra that sucks about customs i try to keep my orders to within the €23 dutyfree limit for here in ireland if your imports are waylaid you pay 20 import duty 21 sales tax and a postage fee for the diversion to customs nasty edited by brickzone 13 august 2008  1115 am	positive
kimt on aug 13 2008 0500 am said the quality of the set feel free to comment on the review andor set also thanks  the set is average its useful for picking up a few knights but im not really partial to the skeleton the idea of a knight and a skeleton tilting just strikes me as being odd my biggest issue with the current castle line is that most sets force you to purchase a mixture of skeletonsknights orcsknights orcsdwarves etc this is fine for those of you who love your fantasy however it makes the line a bit underwhelming for the rest of us still as mentioned earlier the set does have an upside so it is worth a purchase the review on the other hand is aces with great photos and a detailed description of the set and its contents nice work	neutral
you know what i think this set has charm lots of it im not a big fan of castle having very few sets all of them spanning different nationsarmies but i couldnt resist this set and while not obvious at first it really is backwards compatible with every castle set with a horse in it nonetheless i think this set is great its simple cheap and has charm thats good enough for me plus it has that fantastic grinning knight and the black skeleton horse those just made it better	positive
tenorikuma on aug 13 2008 0348 am said i should really get one more of these for the figures shields and weapons this set is the only one with the scythe in pearlgrey by the way except its just plain darkgrey you must have gotten this set mixed with another though ive never heard of a pearlgrey scythe	neutral

brickzone on aug 14 2008 0742 pm said perhaps he meant the pearl light grey lance which is not that common could be its not that uncommon its in several sets now red is uncommon	neutral
first things first the knights helm does have a spot for a plume now i really like this set and it was the first one i dug into when i got my collection in the mail it has a great selection of equipment for good or evil figures and the barding for the horse is outstanding my only wish was for one of the long chrome swords for the knights i think the new knights with the tall shield and chrome sword look excellent on foot and on horseback it would definitely be neat to revisit this set with another human knight instead of the skeleton make that change and add a lady to joust for and itd be bang on	positive
indexed name holiday villa theme lego system  town year 1988 pieces 197 minifigs 2 price usd  there were quite a few sets in the 1980s that werent sold in the us i remember reading once that it was because they contained wine glasses and tlg felt they wouldnt be able to market a toy that encourage the drinking of alcohol this set was one of them i remember seeing this in a catalog that came with a fabuland set and wondering what it was and where i could get one i wrote to lego and got an overseas catalog which had the futuron 6990 monorail transport system in it before it was available in the us i was amazed i ended up buying 6349 holiday villa from that catalog but for some reason gave it to my best friend for his birthday ive always wanted this set and finally bought it from bricklink this year my purchase included everything except the box i really like the boxes but in lieu of a boxshot here is the instruction manual i imagine this was the image on the front of the box the parts one of the things that appealed to me about this set is its abundance of rare parts this base plate is an excellent piece and was only available in two sets classic lego telephone technically these blue windows 1 x 4 x 5 windows are only available in this set according to bricklink it was available in different form with and without fixed glass trans blue glass in other sets regardless this size and color window is rare and the blue door was only available in 4 sets this was a huge selling point for me as im a window monkey never heard that term its like a parts monkey a collector who buys mulitples of sets just for parts or large lots of bulk from bl and sorts them into bins but just for windows tell your friends i coined the term these sloped windows have endless possibilities in many themes maybe not with the curtain decals applied but are another great rare part that appears in this set the build remember this piece id like to see a badass agents car built on this car base  i am a fan of the sixwide car but i see the appeal of the four wide it has a very nostalgic feel to it theres no denying that this is a beauty of classic lego 4wide cars this set comes with two minifigures one of which appears to be a painter classic vintage lego figs onto the house which begins with the basic floorplan a kitchen thats open to the rest of the house and a little oven and hood vent is one of my favorite touches its one thing to throw an oven into a house set but the designer of this set made it a cool part of the architecture of the house which gives it a unique feel the completed first floor and carport i do wish the sides of the roof were white with a little overhang like an actual roof this method of white on bottom red on top looks more like a childs drawing than a real house this is easily fixed with some modifying still you get a lot of roof pieces in this set here we have the completed set the husband cleans the yard while the wife gets plastered on wine dont tell the american kids another angle working in the kitchen getting smashed before dinner i think she may have a serious problem the bedroom a little stark but the bed looks comfy overall shot of the interior rating playability 910 the possibilities are endless with drunky mcwinewine and husband really playability is up to the imagination of the player its a house not really very actionpacked design 9510 great design with plenty of rare parts love the classic car too loses half a point for the all red roof price na i believe this was inexpensive but since i have no proof i will have to leave this factor out of the overall rating overall 92510 classic sets like this all deserve 10s in my book but looking at it with an objective eye its excellent but not perfect	positive
nice set what a great find this is one thing i think the tlg has forgotten about the creator houses are nice but they are not really geared toward a town them no mini figs cars etc these sets were and that adds so much to a town layout it cant be overlooked i really like this i may have to start my ebay searching thanks hinckley	positive
great review and great set i just wanted to comment on the beauty of the car included in this set it gets no better than a fourwide car and hinged roof with sunroof	positive
great review id give this set an 8 at the least its just a tad too simple for my liking but other than that it looks great while im a 4 wide car man i actually think this car looks rather horrendous the main body seems way too low in comparison with the windows the rare parts however do make up for it hinckley on aug 13 2008 1123 pm said yes yes in the states horrifying and deplorable violence is fine but drinking and swearing sends kids directly to hell somehow i feel like watching south park now  that was such a good episode	neutral

well technically it is 4 wide	neutral
hinckley on aug 13 2008 1110 pm said do you like 2wide cars seriously though anyone i love them just see my brickshelf	neutral
its a nice house but perhaps a little sparsh on detail just a few more pieces for additional furniture would have been nice like the car though	negative
this is a really good set what makes it nice is that it is so simple but perfect a feeling that sets dont emit often these days i voted outstanding hinckley on aug 13 2008 0711 pm said remember this piece id like to see a badass agents car built on this car base i was bored and i needed inspiration its not agents but hey nothing is perfect dr brick	positive

thanks for the wonderful review this is really a beautiful set  i love the old lego houses from the 80s and 90s  they were always very quaint and well designed actually i like the old car designs too but only for their nostalgic value in reality they are very unrealistic and look more like go carts that said not all four wide cars are silly looking  the 4wide cars in these city sets are awesome and fit in with the modern city style great	positive
cool review i never knew that those wineglasses could be the reason for this not being sold in the us	neutral
i just bought this its truly a wonderful set and i love the houses from that era as well very charming great review	positive
this is an awesome set man and a great review just too bad it is so rare i voted 5 by the way does anyone know if there is a review for this or other sets that come with a camper perhaps also i was wondering if the creator houses are in scale and could be used with minifigs and such	positive
has anyone noticed the dwarf in one of the completed shots nice set alot better than the new city setslooks at an army of firefighters that have no fires to put out and the police officer army edited by indianajones 21 april 2010  1206 pm	positive
hello all eurobricks members and town lovers today i will be doing up the third item in the shell promotional series in 1998 three out of the eight promotional sets are under town theme the third in the line is the exterme team sub theme which is promoted in 1998 extreme team is a bunch of adventurous daring breath taking individuals that risk their lives for an unforgettable excitement of the lifetime their vehicles range from land air and sea type of extreme taking types extreme team is one the unknown themes ever released in my dark age i only had this small lovely set in my entire extreme team collection hope we are able to see more interesting reviews under extreme team as well name extreme team raft theme lego system  town  promotional  shell year 1998 pieces 19 minifigs 1 price usd200 an image of a 2537 extreme team raft this will be an exciting water adventure this is another great addition to your female population count she is one of thhe daring individuals in the extreme team that take her raft beyond limit into the rough waters where she might face possible dangers look how confident she is with those witty eyes of her i am very sure she will survived the course of her entire journey rafts design this is a very simple design with just a big piece of wooden plank and a couple of logs tied together on the side and it is ready to take it down to the water speaking of some real adventure do you dare to take this raft in the unknown waters there is a small holding area where she is able to place her critical equipment to ensure her safety throughout the journey bottom of the raft excellent range of equipment this set actually provides very good range of equipment there is a pair of oars hammer life vest and backpack the most wonderful piece of equipment is the pair of dynamites first of all they are printed next they can be used in wild west or any playing possibilites which involved in explosives this is a very good impulse set to stock up these accessories i wondered what she need to use these dynamites for her extreme team black jacket is very nicely designed with their logo x or another way of saying xtreme i find the green arms and black jacket matched pretty well with that blue cap front view relaxing herself listening to the calm sea to summarise this is one of the better impulse sets ever produced it comes with a simple raft with tons of good accessories and a very cheap way to obtain dynamites in fact these are my only 2 piece in my entire collection somehow this set managed to find its way to my collection in my dark age and i am very pleased to have this no major flaws on this set it fufill the conditions of an excellent impulse set summary review playability 9510 high playability involved you can used it as an indy adventurers or whatever purpose for the raft design 1010 very very simple design with superb great accessories for a promoimpulse set its very good price 9510 a very inexpensive set based on the 1998 pricing great way to buy this to add in some adventures of your own overall 9710 this is a fanastic set mainly for its accessories get it if you still see any of these its defintely worth the money if its reasonable i gave it a 5 based on my review score card what about yours hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine comments and critics are strongly welcomed pictures can be found in my brickshelf when moderated	positive
cpt pegleg blockbeard on aug 14 2008 0329 pm said over all a nice set i am a little confused by the dynamite though perhaps an easy way to go fishing hilarious i bet she threw out the penicillin and flare gun to make room for the axe and dynamite in her survival kit who wouldnt maybe shes a lost escapee	neutral
good set i laughed at the dynamite but not as much as that axe not many trees on the rapids looks like shes got more than dynamite to cause havoc in the harbour	positive
again a great review whitefang i voted for average the minifig and the accessoríes are excellent  but the raft itself is very poor klausdieter	neutral
glad some of you like this set for the wide variety of good accessories it seemed some are unfavour of the rafts design well i think for an impulse set the rafts design is quite good at least it took care of the color scheme well its just a simple raft for the adventurer to move onto the river stream and throw some dynamitte to blow some obstacles away cpt pegleg blockbeard on aug 14 2008 0329 pm said this would be great for any pirate fan the extraback pack for the soldiers some spare owes for the row boats a female face for a wench and a rather simple raft for that unlucky pirate lost at sea your comments make me feel like i has just done a pirate review instead of an extreme team review	positive
water and lit dynamite isnt a good match	neutral
thanks for this review thebrickster i also have this set and think its one of the best helicopters tlg made in the 90s its quite big and has got place for 2 minifigs in the cockpit i also like the fact that theres a victim included in form of the xtreme diver which also is a theme i always loved as a kid do you have any other resq sets left to review it would be an honour for me to also do a review of one or more sets which are left but unfortunately i got not much time at the moment	positive
metalandi on aug 15 2008 0716 am said do you have any other resq sets left to review it would be an honour for me to also do a review of one or more sets which are left thanks metalandi this and the emergency evac set are the only req sets i have i would encourage you to share a review as you have done some very nice reviews	neutral
cool then i think ill do a review of 6451 river response later today or tomorrow stay tuned	neutral
looks like a nice helicoptor i love the 2 cockpits i love the divers head i really need one of those	positive
this helicopter is so cool and i agreed with you that this is a high playablity set its not common to see such a big scale helicopter which has two cockpits back then the color scheme works well for me with so much features such as the lowering of the grappling hook storage box storing of the gurney and etc one thing which can be improved onto the helicopter is the rotors it could be extended a little longer as the size of the helicopter is too big it makes the rotors rather weak as it is not able to support the weight i am confused why there is an extreme team personnel there i thought he was supposed to be recovered from the resq team although there is so many questions in my head such as why include the black tricycle bike extreme team and etc but this is still one very good set to play with too bad i had never seen this before somehow through your review i like it very much the only big scale helicopter which i owned is the 7738 coast guard helicopter and lift raft neverthless i gave this a 4 thanks brickster	positive
the helicopter looks nice and the resq minifigs were nice the diver minifig had once been a personal favorite of mine	positive
thanks for the review brickster i do own this set in its original form the only drawback that i have noted previously is the lack of rotors and the cobraesq of the copter body i wish it had a larger fuselage but i still have it and i still like it despite my criticismwhich i am sure is in my eyes only thanks again brickster i wish i had bought some of the other res q sets but of course i only bought three	neutral
a neat set with lots of accessories but i never liked any of the lego helicopters with long streamlined canopies as they are obviously more influenced by military helicopters and space ships than by real civilian transport helicopters id give it a 3 at best very good and thourough pictorial review though	positive
i stopped collecting lego sets in the early 90s because of this kind of sets ive always been a classic town fan and i really didnt liked the futuristic design of tlcs newer sets	negative
i think the set is too unrealistic i like the new resq sets better and im somewhat a lifeboat freak so im always following such a sets with interest i would like to see some rigit inflatable boats some day  but about the chopper i like the accessoiries	negative
metalandi on aug 24 2008 0417 pm said what exactly makes you feel this set isnt realistic since the question was asked 1 tiny rotors 2 dual cockpits only seen on a few military copters 3 stretcher extends beyone edges of fuselage when inside the vehicle 4 extra long canopy really only seen on military helicopters and military design 5 black colorscheme for rescue vehicle the the stretcher minifig designs and rescue logo are the only things about this copter that really suggest that it is a civilian rescue aircraft its a toy set with alot of play value but i agree with karto that these kind of desgins really turned me off to alot of the town and city sets of the 90s on the positive side the new city sets with thier realistic nonfuturistic designs have really tempted me to buy more vehicles	neutral
it took quite some time but now im finally continuing with city reviews this one beeing about a really good set of the resq theme and also one of my favourites of this theme it brings a lot of playability and an incredible amount of useful pieces even with only 145 bricks in complete set nr 6451 name river response number of minifigs 3 number of pieces 145 release year 1998 price 20 usd back then when it was new unfortunately i havent got the box of this set anymore but the instructions are still there in good condition we get 3 resq minifigs in this set from which i really love the detailed torsos a shot of the complete set with both the boat and the little car off board the before mentioned car is really really little but it still got enough space to transport 2 minifigs a closeup of the rubber dinghy the speed boat as standalone as already said before this set brings a big count of equipment and accesoires with it which is really good for a set this size in the middle section of the boat there is enough space for a minifig to sit in and put on his diving equipment and last but not least a shot from the whole set wirh everything attached at the front section you can see a wench which also adds a lot to the set when i got this set back in the day i was really happy about it and for sure spent a lot of tie playing with it because of its great features as the wench in the front of the boat or the car the boat can transport i hope you like my little review stay tuned for more in the next days edit i forgot the poll can sombody add it please i dont know how to do or if it is possible to do that myself edited by metalandi 15 august 2008  0359 pm	positive
this set was my first set ever from the resq series and i loved it entirely ofcourse i modded it slightly here and there after hours and hours of fun and excitement it has great play value even for a set in this size	positive
this is one of my favourite sets i remember getting it in tesco soon after it was released those were the days the resq line was good and this set made it better	positive
if you still have all the parts try to rebuild it youll see that its a great feeling	positive
nice review i always wanted this set the speed boat makes the set thanks for sharing	neutral
6004 crossbow cart review because i may start collecting castle here is a review of one of my few castle sets please note i hurriedly put his together meaning some parts are the wrong color look out for them this review will also be done in my star wars review style the lighting is also particularly bad in the pics on with the review parts 20 figs 1 price  1overview and fig the whole set the fright knights knight the disemboweled knight the head printing is just longer then the helmet visor 2 the cart the cart has 3 crossbows and 2 norman type shields the carts advanced defense and weapons systems all the parts from the cart forgot to add the fig in 3extras  overall here are all my castle figs remember i dont collect castle yet  oh yeah i forgot to put one of the old skellies and a ghost on there could a castle fan tell me if any of these minifigs are rare i have no idea because i dont collect castle build 610 pretty standard for a impulse minifigs 710 nice minifig with lots of accessories design 810 this set made way for some of the new castle carts of similar size parts 1010 3 crossbows 2 shields arrow quiver and spear as well as cool minifg in a 20 piece set price 1010 well i dont know but lego was cheaper in 97 so it gets 10 playability 55 pretty much standard for a impulse set overall 810 good parts and price as well as minifig scores this set an 8 thanks for reading	positive
nice review i collect castle too and the ghost isnt really rare i have one too but its not really found anymore so it would be a good thing to keep it anyway great review edited by mammymarf 15 august 2008  0848 pm	neutral
very nicely done  this cart is a striking resemblance to the crossbow cart we got in 2007	positive
nice review i agree with thok it’s quite similar to the more recent crossbow attack though this one has the added benefit of two shields this set would i fleet be more useful to army builders than most of the modern castle sets even though many people don’t like frightknights	neutral
quote even though many people don’t like frightknights i dont really like fright knights either i just happened to have this set	neutral
looks great and the figures up there are old and kinda rare i dont really like fright knights though so i probably wont get this set	neutral
thanks for the review ive added it to the index im not a fan of this theme but i have to say that this is a neat little set that does hold some good things figs and weapons are always welcome and one can never have to many wheels so i rate this average	neutral
this is a pretty nice set i really like the torso and its genericness so it can be used for other factions and at least this set has 2 shields althought i prefer the triangular ones instead of just 1 shield you get from crossbow attack from the wrong fraction id have liked a crown knights shield 100x better some improvements for this set would be a normal bow and a sword instead of 2 of the 3 crossbows smaller wheels and triangular shields 45 from me actually 35 but ill round it up	positive
i gave it above average it was a nice set and included some nice pieces but it is only an impulse set after all edited by newright 19 august 2008  0106 pm	neutral
originally shared in the history  adventure forum for its adventure attributes heres my favorite of the outback collection first let me say that this little set is one of my alltime favorites because it can be used to sumplement a number of different themes 1 the set makes a great little adventure airstrip for adventurers and more recent the indiana jones theme see also german headquarters and port adventure ive also used the set as an addition to my wild west town the tan baseplate and windmill works great just subtract the plane modern equipment and figs and lastly as the set was intended as an outbackdesert airstrip set description outback airstrip set  6444 pieces 157 minifigs 3 release date 1997 original price 20 usd starting with the box and the backside notice the alternate models i love the swamp boat the building is my favorite part of the set it is simple has a little detail two great roof pieces and a single green window great piece check out the great windmill piece its my only one and makes a great part for wild west and that farm you always wanted to build i used it for the barnhouse of barnabas higgens and spring valley ranch on the side of the building is a great radio and a clear glass unfortunately no furniture can be found within the building and now the airplane front view i love the twin propellors side view and the rear section the back has a small cargo hold for some boxesfreight or some gear needed in the outback the set includes three figs two with cool shades and some great equipment i love the boom box a shot of the whole set and another summary as i mentioned above this set is very versatile and can suplement a few different themes its my personal favorite of the outback collection and im really glad i was able to find the set in the late 90s i almost didnt buy sets like this are timeless and so much fun to build and display hope you enjoy the review edit additional reviews review by agentrick57 december 24 2007 outback airstrip review in history  adventure forum february 10 2008	positive
great review this set has cool features i just wish that lego would release this as a lego legend and release it to australia too since this is a set about australia i wouldve bought two if this were a lego legend that is how good it is i like the building with latticed window and windmill i also like the cargo airplane windsock and radios plus it looks like its got great minifigs	positive
this is really an ideal small set in spite of its size it has nearly everything • three minifigs • a vehicle • a building • numerous minifig accessories • numerous rare and useful parts • nice model design especially for the time period too bad outback came out during my dark years	positive
this is probably my alltime favorite lego set it was originally given to me for my birthday by a close friend of mine back in the release year of 1997 the cargo plane was by far my favorite vehicle ever unfortunately someone stole the plane from me when our families went on vacation and the rest of the set was given to my cousins oldest son when i was no longer interested in my lego collection now that im back into lego i use that buildings construction for various projects especially as a dr inferno lookout shack using parts from extra mission 3 swamp raid the shack compliments the original set greatly edited by skorpius47 19 august 2008  0144 am	positive
the building is great and detailed with a few mods it could be added to my castle town i dont really like the plane though seems kind of abstract not really good in my opinion but i bet it would be easy to mod to look better	positive
set 7103 theme star wars set name jedi duel pieces 74 release 2002 price 10 usd minifigs 2 count dooku and yoda links 7103 brickshelf folder bricklink reference catalog peeroncom introcomment i remember getting this set solely because i collect star wars as i rebuild it and took pics of it i found that i actually like this set for different reasons dookus speeder is pretty cool and the lightsabre rocks the dooku minifig is also great whats not so great is the flythingy and getting another yoda though thats kinda hard not to get in a set focused on their duel you cant see the wires because they digitally removed them be careful or ill digidally remove your head  steven seagal i hope i quoted that one right  so to get the review on the move ill impress you all with a box picture neat huh one of the smaller boxes but still kinda big when consider that you only get 74 pieces and 2 minifigs the instruction isnt that big as i said the dooku minifigs is awesome i love the print on his torso that combines the brown cape with the torso and also the head is neatly designed not a fleshie though this was before the fleshlicensefacelift a sideview of the light blue speeder mmmm that crome light sabre hilt is nice the design of the speeder is also ok and without the usual offcolourscheme bricks no tan or yellow sticking out there yeah id panic too if this came right at mewho wouldnt when noones driving and a rear shot i think the design is a little off the shields makes it all a little too open in my opinion the printed bricks are a kick and thus evens the score here this hideous design is meant to flip yoda around the air put him in this funfair from hell thing and give him a twister he and dooku will never forget my guess is that its there to add some playability but its just odd and quite useless much like the playability soccer thingies in the ultimate light sabre duel the verdict ups and downs this set offers both i rate it as average since the size and price of the set make it acceptable to have odd things confused good so am i making a small set isnt that easy and remeber this set is from 2002 and a lot has happended since then designwise that is what do you think	positive
whats wrong with another yoda and some nice light blue bricks i probably would destroy this set and keep the minifigs intack tough chrome lightsabers on	neutral
thanks for the review kimt oldies reviewsold sets  are always appreciated i feel this set isnt that great 1 yoda he is by far the best part of the set although is his weapon blue 2lord tyrannus pretty nice i feel the middle part of his torso is a bit bland but that isnt a problem i wish they would make a fleshie one too 3 speeder bike i always hated this design the back looks terrible to me way too bulky in my opinion it jusnt give me the image that its the same as the movie the lightsaber is amazing why is it only in this set 4yodalifter what that is terrible but at least it has some nicely colored parts a fine set but not the best imo	negative
no yoda was released in no less than 34 sets ok so i remembered wrong i just have plenty yodas and one is more than enough for the set list click here thanks for pointing that out	neutral
nice review i realy like this set two nice minifigs in an affordable set and i do like the speeder but that lift thing is strange but now at least i know what it is thanks for letting me know	positive
thanks for the nice review kimt  i like this set especially by the fact that it is the only set containing the dooku minifig and the curved lightsaber  i also think that the minifig is cool but i also own the dagobah xwing and the wookiee catamaran sets so i have enought minifigs a clone wars version would be very cool  and the extrathingy is well just ok the bad part is that i dont buy the set when it is out and now is go for 40 on ebay and bricklink  edited by darkrebellion 18 august 2008  0951 pm	neutral
oky wan kenobi on aug 18 2008 0241 pm said wasnt this the only yoda that was ever released except for the one in the dagobahxwing set sure he is not the best fig with the unmovable legs and all but still its yoda edit im pretty sure we got a yoda in the wookiee catamaran set from revenge of the sith runs to check brickset yep theres a yoda in that set as well but the jedi duel is the only reasonably priced set with the green forceguru nevermind looks like a couple of other members already covered yodas availability in other sets back on topic great review and a real blast from the past i never did get this set just didnt care for the speederbike or the weird piece of equipment thanks for explaining that its supposed to be used to forcejump  spin yoda all over the place i never knew thats what it was for anyway wish i had known yoda and dooku were going to be impossible to get later i mayve picked this set up just for the minifigs edited by bamaker 18 august 2008  1039 pm	neutral
i missed out on this set but it looks pretty good imo thanks for clearing up what that thing was i thought it was something they flung at eachother in the movie i like the lightsaber also but why did they stop making chrome ones	neutral

i was very lucky to get this set and i love it i dont have it built cause i bought it for parts but it was fun while it lasted 	positive
i got this set a long time ago the review pretty much says all there is to say about it never knew what the redbrown thing was anyway i used it as a canon isnt this also the only set up until now that had count dooku in it	neutral
great review kimt at that time it was still in my dark age and i hated myself not to get this set earlier this is quite inexpensive and you are able to get two greatest characters especially count dooku the minifigs are excellent especially the unique design of count dookus lightsaber i have no problem with the speedbike as it looks quite alright to me as for the elevation of yodas jump adds some playabilty but that does not work well for me nevertheless the main attractive factor is count dooku and i have to rate it a 5 i never own a yoda except for the magnet version	positive
cheers for the review kimt of the initial episode ii lego releases this set was the least inspiring but the minifigs were musthaves you cant go wrong with count dooku and yoda i like the design of dookus speeder in the movie but lego missed the mark a bit with it here and gave him a dodgy flying boat instead the speeder cradleyoda jumping mechanism was just a waste of parts unfortunately id like to see dookus speeder reimagined by lego theyve come a long way in the way they design a lot of the new star wars sets	neutral
i know we have another review of this set but since i just got it i thought i would share my comments on it set name droid gunship platform number 7678 pieces 329 price 2999 before we begin i will say that i like having a droid gunship but i still hope we get a maf hmp droid gunship maf droid gunship on to the review here we have the box it is really shiny and smooth and fits the sets size okay it has a clean bright look and is truley outstanding the back of the box which has the features of the set as well as the other three cw sets the contents the siticker sheet no to bad and the stickers have clear backs which is always nice instructions here we have the figstwo new droids and one older armed droid for the cockpit and the extra parts the build starts with the flat base pretty simple the bottom the side lasers next is the head it starts pretty soild the side buble laser turrets loveing the detail on the ship the lid and eyes the finished cockpit cozy interior would have had more room if it were the maf though the front landing gear simple and effective the back landing gear the rockets the clips are annoying but it make the rockets work so i guess it was nessecary mounted on the bottom not very secure but thats why they are meant to be dropped on the clones the finished ship  let me say that the droid gunship is a nice set indeed final rating 86 hope you enjoyed the review please if you have a ny questions pic requests etc then by all means ask best regards vbbn	neutral

it took a long time but now here it is the review of the xtreme team set 6584 extreme team challenge thebrickster asked me a few weeks ago to do this since he unfortunately never owned this great set so here we go first i have to say that i really love this late 90s town theme and i wish there would have been produced more sets this is the only one i own well beside that i also still have 6572 wind runners but the car is missing anyway lets face the facts and let the pictures speak for themselves subtheme xtreme team set nr 6584 name extreme team challenge number of minifigs 4 number of pieces 354 release year 1998 lets start off with a few quick shots of the box  instructions inside of the box we got some ideas for alternative models on the backside the same ones are also on the backside of the instructions instructions heres an overall view of this huge set we get 4 minifigs each with different heads and color patterns which i really like and also a good amount of equipment for them lets move on with the cool vehicles there are 3  completely different ones in this set first is the neat little trike next the not less neat 4wheeled offroadthing dont know whats it called really  and finally the huge monster truck i love the chrome sidepipes and the wench with the hook in the back which adds a lot of playability oh i almost forgot our brave adventurers also have got a raft to ride the wild mountain waters now lets focus on the many details of the mountain base we got a bridge over troubled waters but be aware its very unstable love the wood patterns on the yellow 1x6 tiles on a corner a camera is mounted to document the wild life for the evenings we also got a little campfire down by the river sits a grey falcon and watches the guys on their challenges whats that seems not very safe to be honestbe aware when you pass by these rocks cause it will collapse lets move up again where the tent is placed inside is plenty of space to take a rest for the figs and to store their equipment but i think they should have built the tent on another place cause the ground isnt very good there when you pull the mechanism a trap door opens will the guys all come back home safe and not injured you decide all in all this is a really great set ome may say it is a bit juniorized because of the baseplate but it really isnt its got a lot of playability and some rare parts the biggest beeing the baseplate which is only available in this set i hope you liked my review let me know your opinions edited by metalandi 23 august 2008  1256 pm	positive

excellent review metalandi i really think this looks like a fun set i esp love the mountain bridge and baseplate it has adventure fun written all over it thanks for taking the time to review this set ive always seen it in pictures but never closeup	positive
cool set i like the tent and monster truck the most	positive
thank you for that very interesting review metalandi a cool set with a lot of features and some nifty vehicles very playable and well designed indeed perhaps a bit too colorful for my likings but pretty impressive in its conception for sure i wish we could see some more landscaping coming along with todays vehicle sets as well	positive
this was the first rock raiders set i got i really like it and i think i got all of them except the huge cargo airlift thing i remember these sets coming out and getting the big base for christmas though they are all destroyed now sadly  nice review	positive
when i first saw this review title i thought it said rapid river review thinking it was an indian set 6766 nice review though i never got into rock raiders i would have loved the large drill bit piece for set s 4970 and 4940 this set looks like a little boulder hawler and a nice set to introduce someone unfamilar with the theme i esp like the fig and the little 2x2 drill bit tile the overall set looks like it has some very useful miningtype pieces nice review and thanks for sharing	neutral
rock raiders was the shit back in the day awesome theme i had this set as well as the tunnel transporter which was amazing	positive
thanks for the review rock raiders was one of the last new themes i knew as a kid before my dark ages came unfortunately i never managed to get any sets from it beside a few months ago the 4910 the hover scout which i review a while ago wish i can get some of the bigger sets in the future	neutral
i do like the set although i dont own it i do remember lusting after it when i was a kid though mainly because of the female minifig and the colors its a bit simplistic but comes with a few great parts you also did a great job on describing the set and the pictures give the full impression of the appearance for the review i just have to point out a few things to give you constructive criticism first of all its chef not chief entirely different professions and secondly the scale you give in the poll isnt very even above average jumps to outstanding which is a too big of a gap in my opinion you shouldve used good or great in between them but these are only minor faults this is a good review anyway	neutral
i rate it a full 5 too and i wish lego would make a set like this in 2010 a town needs pizza edit dont always trust peeron sometimes they miss some pieces and sometimes they just cant count them edited by the cobra 24 august 2008  1141 am	positive

a very good set indeed we have at least 3 of them but we like them all	positive
got this one as well not much surprises in such a small set but the fastfood pizza idea is pretty cool as far as i know only the small mcdonalds promo and this set are related to foodrestaurant thing until the cafe corner that is but since i have a classic lego city i cant miss this set	neutral
one of my greatest lacks in my towni can remember going to the store to buy this one and ending up with another set pirates at home p thank you for the review it might put me on track in finding this set on the web and purchasing it to correct my childish change of mind so long ago 	positive
excellent job and one of the best sets in history if you ask me 55 all the way this is what we need more of whitefang on aug 24 2008 0522 am said devoted pizzeria staff on the left we will have the pizza boy whom is wearing the regular blue dungarees and its white cap i wonder who is that boy on the middle we will have the pizza girl she looks like any typical sweet girl in town that the boys will look at she is wearing a suntop strapless on her she reminded me of one person though i think her name is called alice taking a careful look i wonder if imperialshadows is the pizza boy back then without that black patch on its left eye on another note this minifigure was my favourite female minifigures are very uncommon back then i am glad i have this figure adding to my town population hmmm he does look a little familiar and i definitely recognise the lovely alice now stop staring at her sandy on aug 24 2008 0633 am said its chef not chief entirely different professions actually salvatore as i like to call the chef was in the navy where he reached the rank of chief a nickname he holds to this day so both work in this case whitefang on aug 24 2008 0912 am said flyut if you need decals for the stickers that are featured in this set hang around here until imperialshadows drop by to give you a little surprise if he is free surprise free im not even close to free im rather expensive but i do have a surprise for everyone i think youll be interested in the companion article to this fine review my first set restoration project again great job whitefang excellent review and tlg this is a star amongst your sets think about that when youre designing new ones seriously	positive

great review i really like this set and plan on getting it on bricklink it would certainly add something to my collection	positive
wow great review	neutral
i got the original version as a surprise one christmas my parents liked the design so much they got it for me this is one of the best town sets if it didnt have the delivery van it would have been on par with 6683 hamburger stand a great set in its own right the van and they way the back holds the pizzas is ingenious and bumps this set up to the highest levels	positive
this set is great and so is this review i really like seeing reviews of classic sets like this and hope to see more in the future the chef in this set is the base for my sigfig in fact the classic sets have a totally different feel to them than the newer sets they look more human great review	positive
i remember having this set when it was originally released a good few years back but i dont think i have it anymore i remember i thought it was really awesome though i thought the oven and pizza storage in the back of the car were the greatest parts the little sink on the inside was cool too didnt realise they had made a legends set out of it id love to own this set again but misb examples on bricklink go for an extortionate amount of money ah well se la vie	positive
thanks for all of your kind words and great support for this once famous legend set which got a second chance to be rereleased again for people whom had missed it before indeed this is the kind of lego sets which is great addition for any lego town or city thebrickster on aug 26 2008 0226 pm said excellent review white fang  and a great set to commemorate the establishment of classic townnet i almost ordered this set back when it was rereleased by lego but passed on it im so mad at myself this has all the terrific qualities that classic town sets exemplify i love the delivery truck and the pizza oven a great review from one of the master eb reviewers  outstanding hope you managed to find a good deal in the internet that last comment of yours certainly makes my day bright thanks brickster you are one of them as well lockt on aug 26 2008 0352 pm said one of my greatest lacks in my towni can remember going to the store to buy this one and ending up with another set pirates at home p thank you for the review it might put me on track in finding this set on the web and purchasing it to correct my childish change of mind so long ago  what pirate set did you actually buy instead of the pizza to go hope you are able to find a good buy on the internet imperialshadows on aug 26 2008 0453 pm said surprise free im not even close to free im rather expensive but i do have a surprise for everyone i think youll be interested in the companion article to this fine review my first set restoration project geez you twisted my words free indeed you are dear lastly thanks for that lovely surprise i really enjoyed viewing that sweet decals of yours looks tasty too imperialshadows on aug 26 2008 0453 pm said again great job whitefang excellent review and tlg this is a star amongst your sets think about that when youre designing new ones seriously actually this is one of my surviving stars among my sets well i will need to find better sets for the new ones section8 on aug 27 2008 1007 pm said i got the original version as a surprise one christmas my parents liked the design so much they got it for me this is one of the best town sets if it didnt have the delivery van it would have been on par with 6683 hamburger stand a great set in its own right the van and they way the back holds the pizzas is ingenious and bumps this set up to the highest levels i agreed with you in fact recently there was a hot topic created by kd on what is your favourite takeaway look at here for more discussions and views	positive
i used to want this set so badly and i almost got it when it was rereleased i still wonder why i didnt because with a building van 5 pizzas and a then very rare female fig this set would have been perfect for someone with a smaller collection like i had then what surprised me the most is how well this set still holds up to others today off to bricklink	positive
definitely one of my favorite sets from my childhood i still remember my sister getting it for me for my birthday and me building it that same day too bad i had it displayed all these years on my windowsill so the pizza delivery van and pizzeria have become yellowed	positive
thanks for the nice review of this great set whitefang i always want to grab one but the price to buy it now is too forbidding i also always think the girl minifig is supposed to be a customer lego is really up to everyones own imagination edited by alywin 15 may 2009  0627 pm	neutral
nice review i have this set and i like it alot its a master peice	positive
do you mean this one httpwwwbricksetaspxset29621  i would also like to get that alone for the fact that its the only resq set with a female fig	neutral
i have this set and its pretty nice i love the resq theme in general i think that tow truck is easily the highlight of this set and is probably the best such vehicle ive seen in any city set the other vehicles are also great the base itself is lacking though as it basically consists of one room that doesnt even have side walls it does include a cool 3x6 computer sticker and a vast array of minifig tools and equipment though i have some plans to modify the building and make it larger but have never gotten around to doing it	positive
i just built this set in mlcad as a requestfor a fellow eurobricks member somehow i missed out on this set completely when it came out i was really suprised how long it took to build virtually despite its size this set is packed with details minifigs vehicles and tools thanks for all the pictures gif xml 6479 emergency response center edited by missouribb63 31 december 2009  0932 am	neutral
there are very few late 90s or early 00s sets worth ever having and i wish i had this one with its futuristic look and yes that tow truck too oh yeah heaps of equipment  its not over junorised there is still plenty of building in it thanks and have a happy new year metalandi 	positive
hi everyone this is my first review on lego sets here hope you guys like it and i would like to apologise for the bad quality pictures hope you guys dont mind first i will start with the box art box art i guess this is the first time that lego star wars sets use white and blue colour for their box i like the new colour scheme a nice blend though heres the front the back not to waste space on the box lego do some advertisement to attract us to buy more sets grinthe more the side at the top side there is this minifigs scale picture it is great as we get to know the real size of a minifigs contents the contents consist of a sticker sheet instruction book and 8 packet of bricks the packer are not numbered but it is ok as there is not much pieces instruction book and random page as usual the instruction book have brick checklist other sets pictures and tutorial on how you should assemble your set i mean the very first page sticker sheet there is not much sticker sheet and is a great news that the republic logo on the round plate is printed unlike republic gunship anyway i didnt apply the stickers the commander gear this is a new thing to minifigs as well well is like batman accessories they pack it in one small packet however you only get one commander gear pack in this set anyway i didnt use them the minifigs well we get the the new minifigs the ugly face clone new printed torso and new mold of helmet however i not really like the new head stud i prefer a black one or at least the one like jango fett black colour with face the helmet everything is printed no holes at the visor there but there are hole on the both side this new helmet mold also made the headgear turn 360 degree freely without helmet with helmet you can see the flesh tone at the hole beside the blasters  short blasters were given instead of long one is great at least they give us two blasters instead of one the tank here is the pics of the tank it was not badly design nor nicely design but it looks great if you didnt saw the beneath or under the tank view from front view from side view from back whats beneath under it was 4 wheels to make it move fluently it is made by the thread supporter like the one we fet from tie crawler or battank the functions well firstly you can open up the hood i guess to see the engine secondly the side cannon that can move upwards the thing is quite tight see random instruction page and there is barrier to block the cannon from going downwards the cockpit well the cockpit is small and the space is limited the monitor stuff is printed brick and is another great news you have to remove the piece pic below to reveal the cockpit and put your clone to pilot it popup gunner mechanism well the backdoor have a thing to attack to the seat of the gunner the top hatch is very loose so it there is a clone as a gunner and you open the back door the clone will popup and automatically open the hatch on top this is how the top looks like without a clone there is this movable cannon upwards left and right and a little keyboard thing with it but the cannon fall off quite easily the flick launching missile mechanism the mechanism is on both side and you need to turn the thing inwards to reveal the flick fire mechanism below are the pic of how it is turned you can keep you blaster at the front of the side there are place for you to store them it close nicely completion this is how it looks like extra parts there quite a number of them overall this set is not bad the price is quite expensive but you will like it the popup mechanism is something new to me but this set have more function and 2 clone trooper with a pack of commander gear pros 2x clone troopers high playability nice design cons a little expensive sticker sheet cannon on top falls off quite easy edited by kimt 27 august 2008  1216 pm	positive
wow this is one great review fantastic pictures this looks like one cool set with heaps of neat functions a shame it doesnt include exclusive figures like ahsoka and captain rex in the atte or plo koon and asajj ventress in the gunship but you cant have everything so again thanks for this sweet review peace	neutral

nice review i hope i can get this set as well as agents city  other sw stuff and nice pics i didnt think they were bad i thought they were pretty good	neutral
thanks for the really cool review baby  i think this is an awesome first attemp for your first review it flows well really good pics and many pics  in the set i think this is a good purchase i will buy it when it comes out in the us and i think it is cool looking and the fuctions look neat  edited by darkrebellion 26 august 2008  1112 pm	positive
wow this ship is really big judging from the size of its hull wondering where can i keep it when ive bought it 	positive
but does this mean that they add to the piece count is it a super secret clever way to make the piece count seem bigger than it is hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm  addition ive built it review up later tonite but heres this to wet your appetite	negative
its a shame it only comes with two figs it would be great for my ancient middleeast project	negative
thanks for the pics so far will you have highres pics of the other sets in the instructions	positive
they have made a special middle piece in this 4 set httpwwwbricksetaspxset70751 the only problem is that its red	negative
yoda601 on aug 17 2005 0253 pm said its a shame it only comes with two figs it would be great for my ancient middleeast project if you ever get a moment id love some pics of that ive been tooling around with something along those lines in my ever expanding fantasy setting akkh	positive
right so heres my review finally the whole gallery of box parts minifigs and finished model is here over 2 pages so on with the show minifigs httpwwwbrickshelycgii1340864 in the set you get krakaroff i dunno how to spell it and victor krum the figs are exactly the same bar their heads these are two fantastic figures the expression on krakaroffs face is priceless judging by the design i think we might get a yellow krakaroff cropping up somewhere which would make me a happy bunny hed make a fantastic viking ideally id have liked more than 2 figures for my money three would have done it i think 2 is too few piece count httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344573 httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344571 httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344572 for a 40 set the piece count is quiet good i dont know the exact number but when building it i didnt feel short changed bar the exception of the hull now i dont hate the hull my problem is that is doesnt connect with bricks like the old pirate ships there are pros and cons to this on the plus side its more secure and your whole ship doesnt need to be taken up with support structure the negative side being you cant really make it bigger as theyve only released a megablocking 4 set with the right piece and its the wrong color i also like how its wide meaning you can fit loads of minifigs on the main deck overall though i liked the pieces of note are gold studs httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344510 5 in total you get one spare the return of the black falcon shields httpwwwbrickshelycgii1340835 and the new drumstrang shields the construction a simple fun build nothing too fiddly the finished model httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344474 big picture i really like this set theres no bones about it it seems lego with the latter half of 2005 have given people who loved their original pirate ships hope for the future with this and the fantastic viking longboat even with the two 4 pieces the hull and front of the ship i wasnt put off httpwwwbrickshelycgii1340841 httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344461 the front of the ship is a nice piece and can be used for stuff like castles httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344490 httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344491 httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344492 httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344494 and the hull isnt all bad what i really liked was the little cargo hold at the moment i have a treasure chest in there but there space for about eight of them i reckon playability wise it does make alot of sense and as you can see you can imprision minifigs below deck httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344484 httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344488 httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344506 httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344500 the quarters are great as well you can comfortably fit about six minifigs in the main gally three by the steering wheel and a couple up above the top cabin you could fit more but itd look strange my only gripe is the design of the top cabin when you want to open it up you have to remove the mast i know its simple enough but i think that it wouldnt have taken much for tlc to design it better but saying that its easily done and i like how the cabin can be lifted with ease from the steering deck httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344540 the final play feature is the plank you can while away the hours murdering hapless minifigs whove displeased the cabin a really nice addition for pirate fans the final verdictb playability 9510  lots to do for all the kids piece count 910 a great selection loses one for the hull figures 810  just needs one more construction 910  nice and simple value 8510  let down a bit by lack of minifigs and the cons of the hull boverall 8810 overall this is a set worth getting especially if you miss proper pirates it wouldnt take much to turn this into an amazing pirate ship moc hope you liked my review matt	positive
burnsexcellentburns i love those parts shots great stuff in there this really is a good sign for the new line hopefully therell be the same level of usefulness in the others thanks for taking the time to finish it up did you scan the back of the instructions	positive
i received this set with a 25 gift card so it was a great buy it follow with a similar build to the 2007 trucks but has a few improvements of course the name of the set could have been a bit more creative and yes this was an academy review set name truck and forklift number 7733 pieces 343 theme city year released 2008 price 2500 usd 1999 gbp 2400 euro 1box now the box follows a design similar to most other city sets it has the set information and photo of the set on the front sorry for it getting cut off i will remake it now the back of the box shows what each bag builds bag 1 is for the forklift bag 2 is for the cab and bags 3 and 4 are for the containers it also has the sets features 2contents the instructions there are 2 books included with the set one for the forklift and one for the truck minifigure1 the first minifig you build is a simple cargo worker interestingnew parts here we have some interesting and new parts they include a yellow seat a 1x2 plate with clips and a 1x4 slope 3the build cargo1 the first cargo palette has a few crates on it i really like the sticker on the small box forklift the forklift is a very fun extra to build and it is probably the best forklift that we have had so far it is very realistic and is very strong cargo2 the next piece of cargo is some octan barrels on a meter i am not sure what it is supposed to be but it is still a nice addition to the set minifgure2 the second minifigure is a classic driver with sunglasses and a coffee mug very nice new piece this is a very nice new piece that is included in the set a hollow canopy i believe it is also in white with the police mobile command station truck now anyone who has had one of the lego city harbor sets from last year then you will probably find this build to be very similar mostly in the cab part of the truck the trucks build is very solid and very realistic i sense ths will bring the ratings up quite a bit mystery cargo for some time specualtion has been going around what exactly is this it seems like nuero poison i am very happy with those 2x2 cylinders in transyellow in fact you can join in and guess what it may be in this topic containers the first container is built to hold one palette it fits onto the truck it produces a very pleasing result and has a better look to it than the containers from last year had the second container has the ability to hold two palettes and has a design similar to the first then you build on the wheels the back ones have beautiful mudflaps finshed set  parts 1010 lots of useful pieces great colors and some very cool new pieces minifigs 810 i would have liked another but it was 25 so i guess its okay price per part 1010 almost 350 pieces for 25  playability 810 forklifts are always fun and there are lots of things to do with this set overall 3640 90 a this is truley an outstanding set and it will make a great addition to anyones collection mocers would aslo like this due to the fact that it has some really nice parts it has a great build and utilizes some awesome new techniques it also has details something you might look for in a set highly recommended hope everyone enjoyed the review if you have any pic requests questions etc please ask i look forward to hearing your comments and the judges comments as well 7733 peeroncom 7733 bricklink catalog 7733 shop at home	positive
very nice review of a set that ive been dying to get but my friendly neighborhood lego store never seems to have in stock the yellow seat is most definitely not a new piece i had two of those in my old beta1 command base almost 30 years ago	positive

nice review vbbn i stumbled upon your yellow seat as well didn´t you have one already or what made you think it´s new the big letdown on this set is the big canopy i would have preferred single bricks for that and for this truck there is no real need for a hollow canopy  it could as well have been made of solid bricks maybe we get another set with different use of the canopy this is one of the reasons i didn´t buy it so far and i´m especially not interested in another forklift i have plenty of those i agree it´s the best one we have seen so far though	positive
nice work vbbn im not really into technic myself but youve definately done a fine review on this set funny that it actually fits a minifig perhaps well see fans design forklifts with technic and having it minifig sized	positive
that´s really a sweet and charming little technic set thanks for that fine review	positive
as ive told you before this is a great set and now it has a great review thanks for this	positive
a very original and perhaps even a little weird design indeed but nice and creative for sure thanks for that good review	positive
the ywing is the work horse of the rebel alliance it’s well armed and heavily armoured but you’ll need it because you’ll be moving like a sleepy hut – general rieekan set name ywing starfighter set number 7658 number of pieces 454 figures2 released 2007 list price £3999 lets us begin with the box the front shows it in all it’s swooshing glory httptdyorgukimages765802jpg the back shows some of the many features of the set and also others you might like to buy in the star wars range after opening the box we find a single instruction booklet now we come to an important aspect of any star wars set the figure here we’re provided with an anomalous rebel pilot and his faithful r5 droid the pilot comes with the fairly standard lego star wars nonhero helmet printing what’s he going to do with the blaster taken on the entire empire one of the more interesting parts is the assembly of the engine which if like me you don’t pay enough attention to the instructions when building you can end up getting wrong the key detail i got wrong just before fitting the last engine if we look carefully on the side we can see a missile launcher i didn’t think torpedoes or concussion missiles were fired from there but i may be wrong after fitting the engine the models looks like this in all it’s glory manning one of the alliance’s fighters not so ready to take on the empire was he so overall we have a well designed model which is in my opinion far superior to the original we were offered with darth vader way back when lego star wars was new this ywing is sleek and looks great in my opinion the firing missiles are also a great touch the rating system figures 510 for the same price the last xwing had far more figures parts 610 swooshability 9510 design 910 price 310 grand total 32550 not to shabby conclusion so finally the answers to the questions you’ve no doubt want to know is the set worth the price i’ll be frank £3999 is too much for this set despite this i currently have a squadron of three ywings the reasons is this set has been on sale a number of times at £30 it’s certainly worth the money lego recently placed them online with a price of £20 this i think was a great price for the set and well work picking one or more up if you wanted to start your own rebellion	neutral
thanks for the review ill add it to the index the ywing is one of my favourite rebel fighters and this set justifies the coolest fighter	positive
a wonderful set and a really charming design well detailed and pretty smooth at the same time perhaps that small gap at the cockpit´s an a little weak point but we can always mod a little thanks for that very neat review cardinal brick	positive

csiquet on aug 28 2008 0527 pm said ive built the ywing and the imperial landing craft 7659 more or less at the same time and for about the same prices i think the imperial landing craft ilc is much superior to the ywing the ywing doesn’t have much functionality besides an awkward dropping bomb device and a moving cannon the missiles firing system is … your fingers the ilc has an awesome missiles firing system i wish i could get it individually for mocs a clever bomb dropping mechanism 5 minifigures with weapons the wings fold up together and the “cargo” can be detached as a play set i’ve built the ilc first so i got quite disappointed with the ywing youve got to be kidding the ilc is bulky and doesnt even come close to the design superiority of the ywing its smooth its beautiful and its awesomely designed by the designers at lego its got greebles man	positive

yodalikespie on 03 september 2011  0721 pm said is it worth the money since the new ywing comes out next year please check the date prior to asking questions in old topics three years ago in this case its rude to expect people to answer questions like that especially since its such a generic question besides how is he supposed to answer the question without knowing a lot more about the new ywing	neutral

i think it is a fair to ask questions here with the expectation of a new ywing in the coming year i came here to look at the review even though it is a few years old no images to go with the review bummer id like to see a more friendly tolerance on dated threads being bumped	neutral

etav8r on 19 september 2011  0316 am said is that a threat is it fair to ban someone on the forum because they revived an old thread and made inquiries thought this was a forum to discuss lego and that is what he was prompting i dont really care why he was banned but this isnt the only time ive seen this type of behavior and discourse here on eb not a threat at all  i was simply pointing out that yodalikespie made the mistake of inquiring about the new ywing before we had any information on it to my understanding its not so much the fact that he bumped the thread as the fact that he bumped it for no good reason im not certain where the moderators stand on this issue but i feel that yodalikespies question would have been better received had he posed it after a substantial amount of information had been gathered on 9495  as ive said there simply isnt much one can go off of at this point to determine its value relative to 7658	negative

and lo it came from the east denmark the set which had been foretold the cheap army builder and there was much rejoicing amongst the castle fans the cardinal then asked was all the rejoicing justified… set name the knight set number 5615 number of pieces 21 figures1 released 2008 list price £200 lets us begin with the box the front shows us are knight and his rack of arms the back shows us two sets from the castle range moving inside the box now the contents of the box it doesn’t look like much the instructions to help you through the build now the reason you probably bought the set well at least why i did the knight this features the new torso for 2008 and is the height of fashion this brings the number of printed torsos from the crown knights to three which allows for a greater variety in building your armies a new fashion sensation and all the must have accessories for this season with a more heavily armoured look he’s ready for anything the rest of the set is a weapons rack i assume that once you’ve got a few of these set you’ll probably like me give up building them and part them out but anyway here are some pictures of what the rest of the elements are spent on a long and complex build begins after 360 hour finally it’s finished sadly five minfigs were hurt in the construction of this rack now the money shot where we can see it all come together it looks great even the rack doesn’t look to bad sadly are hero wasn’t ready for other themes just yet in total we have a good army builder which castle fans have wanted however there remains a question in my mind as to if this set is good enough on it’s own without any other castle sets i can’t see it being to much fun so it’s not a good present the rating system figures 910 great new fashion for this season  parts 810 shield sword spear helmet and armour what more could i want well two shields fun fun fun 310 sadly it’s rather dull on it’s own i can’t think or to much else to do design 710 yes it’s the army builder i’ve wanted design well apart from that pirate one price 910 at £200 what more can i say grand total 3650 let down by being to small to stand alone conclusion so let’s answer the question is it the army all castle fans have wanted well yes and no is the answer while it is a great set and at the now reduced uk price of £200 amazing value i still think it’s inferior compared with the army building capability of cross bow attack i much prefer army building both factions at once	positive
thanks for sharing this review with us ill add it to the index one of my favourite impulse sets along with the troll warrior or is that orc warrior	positive
nice review and i especially enjoyed the ending i personally think it is quite a good set for the price considering it comes with a fully armed minifig along with enough stuff to suit up another i just wish amazon carried this set	positive
do we really need more construction works legoland is just one huge building site theme city set name mini digger set number 7246 number of pieces 36 figures1 released 2005 list price 350 usd 7426 peeroncom 7246 bricklink catalog diving right in let get some photos of the box the digger at work the back just has more of the same not to inspiring once we open the box we find two poly bags and some instructions the total contents of the box well minus the air instruction booklet short and simple now the single minfig of the set nothing new of special that i can see …got a job working construction for the johnstown company moving onto the digger itself it’s one of those builds where all you really need is a quick glance at the instructions and off you go side view of the finished product alternative view it doesn’t look to bad now lets add our construction worker looks rather good though the lifting action isn’t smooth it’s nothing special it’s not the greatest construction set that lego have ever produced but i think it is worth the money the arm action really does bug me though the rating system figures 510 just another construction peon parts 410 nothing novel and i dislike the new digger arm system fun fun fun 710 i think the playability is high and you can get a good load of bricks in the bucket design 610 not the best designed digger but not the worst price 710 a reasonable price for what you get grand total 2950 still halfway decent but nothing to write home about conclusion this set is yet another in a long line of lego digger and to be honest it’s not the best in my opinion i still hold nostalgic memories for 6504 which i still think is a great digger from my point of view the set sits to high off the ground and make me wonder how the worker gets in i really don’t like the digging arm action it will never be smooth and while it poses better i just think it’s inferior despite this i still think it’s not a bad set i’d just like it to be so much more	negative
finaly we get a new mech for takeshi and yes its yellow it brings back some flashbacks of supernova good times anyways i recieved this set at christmas last year with 3 other ef sets set name assault tiger number 8113 pieces 163 theme exoforce year released 2008 price 1500 usd 1895 eur 1box the boxes this year are much different than those from previous years it has some gaps in it and has a cardboard backround inside of it the box itself shows assault tiger and the set information the back shows a combiner the cardboard backdrop a very nice jungle look to it it has lots of fog as well creating a pale effect 2contents the instructions the instructions are clear and straightforward also included is a lego blooper the remains of the sticker sheet the stickers arent too bad i didnt apply the saw sticker as i wanted it to be left plain the buzzsaw a very cool piece mocists will love this 3build the figures the figures included are takeshi who features a nice new torso also included is the mini robot his is a very neat little guy but sadly he doesnt really become a weapon more of a block of red and black bricks the torso now the torso design for assault tiger is very different from the past years it now uses a castlelike piece as the main structure also of note is that he has a mini throne no controls sadly and with the orange cockpit piece its impossible to see takeshi when looking at the at close on see the third pic the legs the legs are slightly similar to the mt201 ultra drill walkers but have been modified to fit the at they are quite large and suit their purpose the arms the arms follow a new design but the only problem is they have no elbow or hand articulation nice weapons though the finished product  parts 1010 lots of useful pieces great colors and some very cool new pieces minifigs 810 a robot would have been nice and a better weapon mode for the minirobot would have been good price per part 710 a stretch playability 810 the lack of elbow and wrist articulation isnt the greatest overall 3340 825 b assault tiger is a nice set but some of those small little things can truly take a toll on the final rating i think that i would only recommend this set to anyone who wants the yellow and hardcore exoforce fans sh link peeron link i hope you enjoyed the review and if you have any pic requests or questions please ask edited by sinner 01 september 2008  0152 am	positive
thanks for that good review vbbn that´s really a fine and pretty solid looking mecha i think that the designers did a good job on this last wave of ef sets and the inclusion of these mini robots was also a pretty smart idea	positive
nice to see a well done review this set is one of the few exoforce sets i havent built myself yet but i will get it on sale guess soon im do not like the use of slizerstyle balljoints in exoforce even though they are modified to 2x2 bricks in this particular set i think the arms look weak and they lack elbow joint like the green 2008 mech set forgot name of this years green mech quite a shame i find it really hurts the functionality of that green set and could imagine the same with the tiger i guess with the new pyramide brick as cockpit the cockpit is still open from the sides and the back i modified my green 2008 mech which use the same cockpit design with a few green bricks and it is now completely closed from all sides i rate the tiger at average but i may change my mind when i get to build it myself front	positive
this was my first exo force set and i was quite skeptical towards the mecha theme so i got it because it seemed to have nice parts it turned out however that the mechas are quite nice  i really like the poseability of it and since then i got another ef set	positive
the assult tiger is pretty cool	positive
i just bought 2 of them since they were 5 each from lego i really wish they did not cancel this series	positive
i voted average i think this is the least attractive among the 2008 exoforce sets i saved my money to buy some of the 2006 mechas	negative
best impulse set so far thanks for sharing your thoughts and yes someone should look into that rodent issue ill add this to the index within long	positive
kimt on aug 29 2008 0655 am said best impulse set so far agreed i love this little sets i cant wait for it to hit shops here the rodent problem is funny but i lov always getting more animals so that is a plus the cart is a nicely formidable machine that i will keep together so i can maximise their fire power the troll figure is one of my favourite ever too i love that torso and helmet and i want that sword in grey i only have it in bronze thanks for the review batbrick away	positive

nikola bathory on aug 28 2008 1147 pm said wait a second a troll isnt that an orc i thought that this is a troll those are giant trolls the regular sized green guys such as is included with this set are trolls yes they look like orcs but lego calls them trolls	neutral
nice review i never new trolls had fireworks at least thats what it looks like to me maybe i shall build a trollish fireworks company fireworks on	positive
im not really impressed by this set as much as other impulse sets the knight impulse set 5615 offers more in my opinion since it gives two helmets two weapons a shield and an armor piece along with the weapon rack im not a fan in the slightest of flickfire missles and projectiles like on the cart and the previously mentioned one piece axle limits the wheel usage in other mocs i wouldve liked to see an added chest armor piece at the very least and a shield wouldve made this great those things are so rare and it wouldve bumped the piece count up to 21 to match the knight set since both are showing the same price on shin us dollars at least it wouldve made sense	negative
more firefighter there must be a pyromaniac in legoland somewhere theme city set name firefighter set number 5613 number of pieces 25 figures1 released 2008 list price £200 gbp 350 usd 299 euro 5613 peeroncom 5613 bricklink catalog 5613 shop at home starting as always with the box i didn’t know red cylinders were flammable interestingly an action shot and not other sets you might like to buy the contents of the box looks much like every other impulse set firefighter not sure there’s much else to say apart from i wish they’d included breathing equipment looking pretty pleased with himself if you ask me the equipment rack is fairly standard and easy to build it does however include a fire hydrant inbuild shot will i be able to finish this complex build unsurprisingly i did i nice selection of kit is provided all together i think the fire is a bit odd but it does add playability if you want to increase the number of your firefighter and their equipment this is a great way though there is something missing in my mind the rating system figures 510 fairly standard i already have a fair few parts 610 good selection of tools but lacks the breathing apparatus i’d expect in a set like this fun fun fun 510 there’s clearly something to do even if you just own this set design 510 not going to win any awards but it’s robust price 810 nothing to complain about you get a lot of accessories for the price grand total 2950 reasonable design and good accessories a good set to improve any fire department conclusion this isn’t a set i’d necessarily buy but while i was at bluewater today i decided i should try to review every impulse set myself so that why i bought it still i think it has some good playability and a good set of accessories if you need more firefighting kit i just can’t get passed the lack of breaking apparatus that would have made it a better set in my view	negative
quote if you want to increase the number of your firefighter and their equipment this is a great way though there is something missing in my mind whats missing	neutral

this here was a set that i new i had to get a beautiful minfig amazing minfigs what more could you want so was this set worth it i guess you will just have to read the review to find out set name the batcycle harley quinns hammer truck number 7886 pieces 267 theme batman year 2008 price 3500 usd 4496 euro 1box the new box art for batman is pretty stunning its clean and really sells the set for this set harley quinns truck is pictured attacking batman with the set information the back of the box shows a nice little comic the other sets as well as the set functions 2contents the instructions the instructions for the set are as always clear and straightforward they display the colors well and have what we expect in an instruction book 3build minifigs the stars of the set batman is back with a new torso much more metalic than before harley had all new printed torso legs a new head and that sweet new hat batcycle the bottom part is very sturdy thanks to a small bit of technic the red throws it off a bit but it isnt seen once the top part is put on it has a nice use of the smoke stacks and looks very nice in the end the top part is simple but suits the purpose well it has handle bars and a nice motor the blue is a little strange though hammer truck the hammer truck begins with a very sturdy base it has lots of detail and really looks cool rims added lego did a very nice job at giving it a checker board appearence the only problem here is that you stick a sticker over two bricks multiple times jewels inside of the crate are these shining jewels look how they illuminate the darkness in gotham more added then we add on a spoiler and the crate looking very nice now the detail is again outstanding and it has a good amount of smoothness to it the infamous hammer okay i havent said this yet but the square pieces need to stop first on those sw backta tanks now on the hammer it creates a sloppy look for the hammer still this is the ultimate wacking weapon added to the truck on the truck it works pretty well but the handle is to short and its near impossible to smash batman the finished truck the finished truck is really nice the big wheels give it the monster truck feel and the way that lego alternated the colors works well the cockpit is a little palin but thats not a major issue the i love joker sticker is one of the best stickers ive seen its simply a classic the finished set  parts 910 lots of good mocing pieces and red and black are always usefull minifigs 1010 awesome playability 910 the hammer is a little short priceperpart 810 its a liscensed theme so meh set 7886 is a very nice set and has some great details in it the minifigs are very cool as well however their are some flaws first the hammer is two short and is kind of square the batcycle has a few awkward colors in it which throws it off a bit this set is definatly worth the money batman fans will love it and also wacking fans will like it for that hammer and if you would like to buy this set here are a few useful links sh link peeron link please let me know your comments and pic requests and questions are welcome	positive

welcome to another sunny day in legovilletoday we will be joining the mailman on his daily route delivering the days mail when i first saw this set i immiediately liked iti think tlg should make more of these everyday life type sets such as delivering mail going to the grocery store things like that anyway enough blabbering on to the review 7731 mail van set name 7731 mail van year 2008 theme city pieces 66 price 799 pounds 499 euros 595 price per piece about 12 cents well start with the box shots the box is an interesting shape that i have never seen before very rectangular the box art is pretty nice the back shows the mailman delivering some mail the picture on the front is the same as on the box random manual shot the manual does not have the piece call outs but on a small set like this i dont feel its needed parts list decent selection of parts i really like the mail pieces image at the back of the manual showing all of the cargo sets together in a little scene i like it when the manuals have images like these because its nice to see all of the sets together all of the parts spread out the parts in this set are pretty good unfortunatly the car base is one large piece however we do get 2 printed mail pieces which are always nice our trusty mailman this torso i think is very nice the little envelope is a nice touch extra parts not much to say here the finished set i really like the design of the van it looks very smooth and somehow looks very lego to me the colors are my favorite part the red and yellow look nice together a nice mailbox however i wish the letter on the front was printed the front of the van is nice i think the textured brick on the front gives it a different look on the front which is nice the back of the van the doors open to store mail although it doesnt have much room i like that they included this feature delivery the mail bricks slide right into the hole at the front this adds nice playability the vans all loaded up we are ready to deliver  parts 710 pretty good piece selection but for 8 should have included a few more playability810 its fun to deliver the mail to all of your towns residents design 910 the design is very nice except i feel that some of the stickered parts could have been printed overall 2430 after a long hard day of delivering mail theres nothing like enjoying a nice pizza and letting your hair out why do they make us wear those silly hats anyway this is a nice set that i can definitely recommend and i think tlg should certainly release a post office to go with this and the air mail set i really like these everyday life sets rather than always fighting crime or putting out fires those guys have normal lives too brickshelf folder httpwwwbrickshelrycgif338718	positive

good review thanks for the mail van while it certainly adds interaction and fun to a lego town it alone lacks details and playability and thus not a good set especailly taking its price into consideration its value is pretty much just like if not less than some impulse sets in my opinion	negative
its a good set but i think the first sticker shouldnt say 7731	positive
legoman132 on aug 29 2008 0635 am said this set is nice it looks like a dhl van makes you wonder if there was some kind of promo or hookup in the pipeline that never happened i have this set and i really like it it works well with either the new city sets or with my older 1980s1990s sets i actually like the use of the old style car base and mourned the day that these became exitinct the first time round c1990 thanks for the review cheers rog	positive
its an ok set i just dont really like the look of the van much too rounded for my liking what happened to the box like cars	negative

nice review i like this little set some how it reminds me now of postman pat in dutch pieter post an english childrens tv series about a postman in a little village somewhere in yorkshire aah sweet memories i would rather have seen a postoffice released with some women minifigs instead of the green post bigplane but maybe in a couple of years	positive
i do like the set also ive bought 2 of them one to build it up and one to keep it misb i dunno for how long  only poor things is that the wheels are too wide car is 5nops wide instead of 4 afterall a good design i wonder if theres a post office coming soon by the way great review	positive
welcome to another sunny day in lego city the sun is shining the birds are singing minifigs are drowning wait what the coast guard rushes to the scene and deploys the coast guard 4wd  jet scooter to save the poor minifig from drowning lets take a look at the coast guards buggy 7737 coast guard 4wd  jet scooter set info set name 7737 coast guard 4wd  jet scooter theme citycoast guard released 2008 price 999 usd995 eur799 gbp pieces 130 minifigs 1 price per piece about 8 cents now the review the box here is the front it shows a nice image of the buggy on the beach with the ocean in the background the back the back shows some of the features in the set such as the extra equipment manual the picture on the manual is the same as on the box as usual the parts the set has great colors i love how the orange blue and white look together the part selection is quite good but unfortunately uses the large car base coast guard minifig this is a great fig the torso print is very nice and matches the buggys colors well new tire mold here are the new tires they look very good inmanual shot color separation is not a problem here and since it is a small set the piece call out is not a necessity extra parts it is always nice to get extra cheese slopes the finished set the design of the trailer and jetski is great the jetski is very smooth looking and the color scheme is fantastic the sticker on the roof is nice but its actually too big for the piece the corners of the sticker flap where the piece curves jetski closeup here you can see how it attaches to the trailer i didnt add the sticker that goes on the front which is a little sign that says bb03 or something attaching the trailer this is where the trailer connects to the main car it attaches simply with a ball joint car front view the license plate is a nice sticker and the top lights look nice say cheese driver the back the back is very similar to the front it has the same sticker the equipment rack a very welcome addition to the set it adds quite a bit of playability the orange fins are great all decked out he looks pretty spiffy in his diving suit doesnt he brickshelf folder the ratings price 1010 you cant get much more in here for 10 parts 910 nice selection and great colors the big car base is a bit annoying design 910 the jetski is a prime example of something with a small amount of pieces that still looks amazing playability 910 you can drive the car go diving and jetski across the bay minifig 710 the one it comes with is great but it could have come with one more perhaps a citizen of some sort build 810 simple but looks great overall 4250 lego sh brickset peeron bricklink even in the face of danger this member of the coast guard always has a smile on his face summary simply put for 10 you have to buy this set it is one of the better sets in this price range you can buy and one of the best small city sets the colors are great the design is great and the fig is great i dont normally think small sets are worth heavy praise but this one definitely deserves it thanks and happy building	positive

erdbeereis1 on sep 2 2008 0915 pm said i meant the piece call outs during the build that show which pieces you need for that step oh cardinal brick on sep 2 2008 0905 pm said one question though do you think the jet ski is as good as previous ones i have to agree that the jetski is an awesome little piece of design apart from the handle bars it has a really cool orange piece on the front a piece ive never seen before  the 4x3 wheelarch sort of thing cheers rog	positive
i agree that this is a very good looking set i just finished building mine yesterday and i love it but here is one suggestion trim the large sticker that goes on the roof of the vehicle by cutting along the angles at the front of the sticker if you use it as it is it will extend beyond the flat surface of the roof and will overlap the lower sections past experience with stickers has suggested that this sticker will lift at the front corners lego stickers are probably the best that there are but sometimes modifications must be made now i want that large coast guard helicopter 7738	positive
great review of a great set one question how does the robotarmpiece connect to the jetski	positive
it gets placed on top of this piece	neutral
the coast guard sets are very eye catching the color scheme is making me want to pick up the entire line although the offshore platform hasnt been released stateside yet ive had my eye on this particular set for a few weeks now and is near the top of my to buy list with instructions provided on legocom i build a dr infero version of the jet ski to replace the one used in mission 2 swamp raid its a very sturdy design bulky enough to make it feel like a real vehicle great review too thankyou for the closer look at the set	positive
erdbeereis1 on sep 3 2008 0436 pm said it gets placed on top of this piece i thought so so thanks for confirming	neutral
arrgh me hearties lets join the pirates as they try to steal the sacred treasure from the islanders hands it wont be easy king kahuka and his loyal warriors closely guard the treasure 24 hours a day will the pirates with their trusty pistols and cutlasses be able to defeat the islanders spears pet alligator and powerful leafy skirts we will find out 6262 king kahukas throne set info set name 6262 king kahukas throne theme piratesislanders released 1994 price  i dont know the original price i got it from bricklink with no box for 17 unfortunately i was not able to locate the euro or pounds price pieces 123 minifigs 5 off we go unfortunately i dont have the box because i didnt like the idea of spending over 50 for a set with under 200 pieces so sorry no box pics instructions i think the image on the front is very good it seems less setup somehow than the instructions these days it looks more like someone snuck up on them while they were going about their duties and snapped away rather than something that was planned the parts a nice selection here there is a pretty good amount of printed pieces in this set which is always nice for example the zebra print tile as well as the pirate flag nowadays would almost certainly be stickered the set also comes with a nice dark grey burp and a red boat for the pirates the minifigs the main buying point of this set for me were the minifigs this set comes with 5 of them which is quite good for a small set like this especially when compared to the sets of today the set comes with 1 alligator 2 pirates 2 islander warriors and king kahuka himself i really like the islanders torso and leg prints the leafy skirts are a nice touch and the makeup on the faces is superb some parts i liked these shields have a nice design on them and i always like the treasure chests a picture inside the manual this is a feature that i liked in the manual it shows an overhead view of the baseplate so its much easier to find where to put the piece i certainly could have used this feature in last years aquabase invasion set a closeup of the king the face print is nice i wonder who kahukas makeup artist is the finished set first the pirates boat the boat is really nice the sail is made out of a nice cloth and connects simply to the mast and now the main part of the set the throne this is a really nice model i think the colors and the design make it really feel like a different part of the lego world the rock sculpture looks fantastic as well the throne which is sort of a stretcher thing attaches here it connects on a 1x2 tile with a stud in the middle for easy removal here is the treasure that the pirates seek the treasure rests on tiles inside of the rock the zebra print tribal drum this is simple but nice one thing thats great about this which i mentioned earlier is that this and all of the other pieces with designs on them are printed thats right no stickers to be found here i have used these zebraprint tiles many times for mocs as they make a great exotic detail piece the lovely rock head i think this is wonderful it really adds a lot to the set it is well built with grey slopes curved pieces for the mouth and nose headlight bricks for the eyes and feathers and horns for detail the backside the complete set overall this looks great in my opinion with great landscaping and some fun parts well it looks like the pirates walked all over the islanders and stole their treasure in fact it looks like it was pretty brutal brickshelf folder now for the the ratings price 810 for 17 not a great price per piece value but when you add 5 figs in it makes it a decent price plus this set hasnt been in stores for 14 years so that adds some cost parts 910 the set has some really nice printed parts as well as a baseplate which in my opinion is great design 910 no flaws that i can think of right away the rock face is very well built playability 810 not really anything to play with although you can sail the ship and steal the treasure build 910 rock face uses nice techniques and the rest of the set is simple but looks good minifigs 1010 the minifigs are just fantastic great prints and just overall fun overall 5360 bricklink entry peeron brickset it looks like the pirates have picked up a new recruit from the island summary the older lego sets have a really different look to them than the new sets and i think its nice to have a mix of new and old this is definitely a great set with a nice build and great minifigs add to this the great printed pieces and that old pirate charm and you get a very nice set that i can certainly recommend thanks and happy building edited by erdbeereis 17 august 2009  0239 am	positive
erdbeereis1 ive had a quick look your review and i must say its quite superb im dead tired so im going to take a nap but ill be back later to read it more thoroughly	neutral
i had to vote outstanding on this set because it simply is great minifigs a cool head sculpture and a nice little boat means unlimited playability great review though man	positive
as ive already said somewhere on this forum this is the largest islander set i own and therefore my favourite thankyou for your great review i picked mine up for only 5 pounds along with crocodile cage and king kahuka but i cant help you with the original price i would search the web but im too tired right now	positive
i feel the same way about the islanders sets brickster they are a nice change from the regular pirate versus soldiers that is the norm i think it would be interesting to see some new islanders sets released in the new pirate line to see how tlc would make them	neutral
what a wonderful review with smart showing the right parts and clear pictures fantastic job erdbeereis1 this set is interesting for several reasons first of all it contains a large amount of very useful minifigs not many sets of this size contain so much figs secondly the throne itself can be easily combined with the other islander sets or even with other pirate and nonpirate sets im going to see if i can get this one for a reasonable price on ebay	positive
excellent review i want this set now	positive
17 for an old set is good i may hunt for it on ebay 	neutral
an outstanding set too bad that i couldnt get this set set when it came out 	positive
well for some weird reason i missed this before so i tell you now very good review as we are used of you erdbeereis1 i like all the islander sets and own quite a few myself for people that dont own any of the islander sets yet the 6262 king kahukas throne is a great way to start lots of minifigs and accessories	positive
i do not like the fact that the clones have pure white legs it looks weird to me it was also weird that they included shock troopers but it was probably a way to get people to buy it this set also seems like one of those that was kind of thrown in with a mix of other sets like the tie crawler i never picked it up and with the new clone wars sets out i wont	negative

stauder on aug 29 2008 0845 am said has anyone noticed the boxart includes the 3rd leg both in the lowerd position as well as the raised one stauder i believe thats to show off the functions of the set nice review you carefully explained every detail and i think that ill buy this set now im glad lego decided to make two seats in the interior and they did a very nice job on the third leg looking good both up and down i think i will switch the hips of the shock troopers into black like the other shock troopers	positive

technic rotation joint disc set list its used in 10 different sets so far not exactly a new piece a nice review with many good comments i really like this set its one of the walkers with really good design and a lot of playability its the usual issue of using too many technic pieces to make a moveable feature versus minifigscaled design the same issue concerns for example the atat the twilight and the atte plus more sets what annoys me in this set is the use of the 2 tan 4x8 plates they stick out and it would have been better if they the designers had used dark grey or light grey plates also ill add this to the inventory  now	positive

i like this set but i dont like the pure white legs for the shock troopers it looked better with the black leg joint piece i also think the set looks like half an atte	negative
did anyone encounter the problem with the main turret apparently the very tip of the piece cone shape cant be put onto the pole piece i check the instructions 2 times and still cant find what im doing wrong is it just me or did anyone else got this problem as well	neutral

i could have gotten this set if i wanted to but it seemed like a waste of money to me i dont like the shock troopers helmets that much i feel they should have printed visors instead of cut out ones like they have in my opinion it would make it look a lot better the at ap itself sounds like it has a lot of holes in its cockpit which drags the set down and make it seem like they havent exactly put a lot of effort into it great review	negative
valentin nice review i was thinking of doing this review and realised there were 3 reviews being done for this lovely set i must admit this is an amazing set after buying it in tru for sgd4990 15 discount i like the comparison of both spider droid even though one is not lego thanks for doing this lovely review its enjoyable to read	positive
thanks keke imagine the horror that gripe my heart to see the discounted price on the sgs toys r us flyer about a month after its release into retail anyway looking forward to your other reviews too	positive
alakazam the good wizard is the wisest minifig in all of legoland he is a master of the wand and can see the future with these abilities he helps the knights predict where the trolls will strike next because this set is not in stores in the us i was luckily able to buy this set on my vacation to germany it is interesting that it is a euro exclusive 5614 the good wizard set info set name 5614 the good wizard theme castle released 2008 price eur 295gbp 199 pieces 16 minifigs 1 the review unfortunately i dont have the box because in got smushed in my suitcase on the plane so needless to say it was not in top condition the manual the manual is an extremely small foldout but the image on the front is nice on the back of the manual there is a picture of some of the 2008 impulse sets this is a nice feature the parts for an impulse set this has a pretty good selection a very nice owl and an interesting clear ball piece all built this set took me forever to build i had to take numerous breaks as it was the toughest longest build i have ever faced for an impulse set this actually looks pretty good the owl perch is nice also the crystal ball table the wizard is a very nice fig with great printing on the legs and hat and i love his beard brickshelf gallery the ratings price 810 not bad but i feel that impulse sets are slightly overpriced parts 710 impulse sets are focused around the minifig but the parts in this set are pretty good design 710 the crystal ball is a good idea and the owl perch is simple but nice playability 610 there is not much to play with here build 810 as i said before it took forever really it took all of 1 minute minifig 1010 the wizard is fantastic overall 4660 bricklink lego sh brickset abracadabra blades of four you are now a dinosaur summary for an impulse set this is very nice the wizard is an excellent fig and getting an animal in a cheap set is always great i would definitely recommend this set thanks and happy building	neutral
good review for a simple set while it does come with the basics for an impulse set i just feel that it lacks something though i am not sure what perhaps a printed magic scroll i am still not a fan of the printed cap especially the stars but i do like the printed pants displaying his various goodies hanging from his belt the plain torso is to be expected from a wizard minifig i suppose overall its not a bad set but it certainly feels to be lacking something imo	neutral
thanks for the review i love this impulse set i bought two of them so i could make a wizard and his apprentice i didnt have an owl either so an extra is pretty cool and i like the trans globe piece batbrick away	positive
the next in my attempt to review every impulse set single handed theme space mission mars set name alien jet set number 5617 number of pieces 21 figures1 released 2008 list price £199 gbp 350 usd 299 euro 5617 peeroncom 5617 bricklink catalog 5617 shop at home as always we begin outside of the box it looks rather exciting at first glance set that cost a lot more than this one now for what€™s inside the contents of the box the impulse sets never look that inspiring now for the alien i have to say i€™m not impressed i€™m not a big space fan and i only bought this due to my impulse review challenge but as the main point of the impulse sets is the alien is a little hard to build a good set round something with one point or articulation it lacks what make lego minfigs so great their articulation now for the space vehicle as always with impulse a short and easy build ensues took maybe 2 mins at the most time to mount the alien in his craft the craft looks a little wide for him slightly better from this angle but still not winning any awards i€™m disappointed of the impulse sets i€™ve reviewed so far this is clearly the weakest of them but what really disappointing is the other seem so good and useful the rating system figures 310 the alien is not a good minfig parts 610 some interesting parts but nothing that special fun fun fun 210 i can€™t think of anything to do with this set to be honest design 410 poorly designed the box makes it look much better price 610 despite the impulse price tag i€™m still unhappy about the price grand total 2150 less than half marks the lowest i€™ve given so far conclusion in many ways i€™m annoyed from the outside of the box this set looks quite interesting and certainly appears to be well designed the idea of a small alien fighterflying craft is in my opinion a good one but sadly when you€™ve got the finished product in your hand it looks nothing like the box art while i think mission mars had some interesting sets and i might still get some of them this one will not be a repeat purchase for me	negative
worst set of the year worst set of all time the pictures say it all no ratings necessary a waste of paper for box and instructions and waste of plastic for bag and jelly alien the little alien ship that comes with the switch fighter beats this one hands down as well as any other lego spaceship i have ever seen and i have seen many thankfully this set isnt available in my country which is something i never thought i would say anyway i hope tlg makes these awful jelly aliens disappear forever after this year	negative
thanks for the review considering the price i give it below average i didnt buy any of the space impulse sets as i dont think they are good value	negative
to be honest i am going to give this set a 1 that is my lowest rating i will ever give to a set in eurobricks in fact this is the only impulse set which i do not have it at all after looking at your wonderful review i am going to give it a 2 and actually consider it to buy at least one to complete the entire impulse set series i dont really like the design and the alien at all in fact i prefer the mars mission astronaunt more than the aliens i dont really like the set but i like your review	negative
i already dont liked the aliens but if the fighter was better i would already bought him now i will maybe buy one of it just for the 2 limegreen pieces	negative
impluse sets are made good by using parts well and minifigs this has either i give a low score i really dislike the alien figs worst lego fig ever	negative
you you got it mint in sealed box it indeed is a nice set i am not into space but nevertheless this set is a good addition if you need to get your space environment a little bit more crowded lego however is planning to release a minifig set again next year city and of course the advent calendars are also quite nice to get some figs with accessories	positive
cardinal brick on aug 30 2008 0623 pm said the question is what could you do with this set i mean it’s just spacemen in a line what could you do the possibilities are endless 1 you can stand them in a line 2 stand them in a circle 3 stand them in a square 4 sit them all down 5 sit some of them down and leave some standing up adult supervision may be necessary for tfols attempting this one 6 take them all apart and scatter the pieces like some kind of huge space mine has gone off 7 yeah ok thats probably enough for now seriously i love all the sets of minifigs from all the different themes and this is a great one i always wanted them when i was a kid but never did my focus always was on town sets petrol stations and police sets please stand up and there was never enough pocket money left over for space sigh you are so lucky to have this great set thanks for sharing cheers rog	positive
thanks for the review the latter space minifig sets were great as they gave a nice variety of men id love this one	positive
fantastic review this is one of the classic minifigs pack which is so great for gathering massive number of minifigs i miss those days where they sell 5 minifigs together in a set thanks for this lovely review	positive
nice set lucky you the only reason i buy the mm impulse sets is lack of good space minifig packs like this nowadays 	positive
thanks for sharing this review with us i think this one of the sets in europe this thing is waaaay overpriced and thus makes it a crappy set we pay nearly double the us price so i rated it poor also because the figs included does not make it great the hailfire is well designed and looks great but thats just about all there is worthy of a positive mentioning sorry on a side note as a bronzeawarded student wheres the price in eur and gbp and wheres the poll nevermind the poll ive added that one for you 	negative

great review i agree that this set is underrated the hailfire is supposed to be a little taller than two battle droids so scalewise its nice the dwarf spider droid is amazing in my opinion i just wish it wasnt brown it makes me feel like its on geonosis we never saw a grey varient of the hailfire so its fine with me that its brown	positive
this is a must have set for aotc fans and i really love the hailfire droid but it costs like 80 or more now that its discontinued	neutral
kimt on aug 30 2008 0527 pm said i just bought this set the other day and i must admit that it gets a below average from me the price is not corresponding with what you get which would be implied had jim added the eur or gbp price in the infohint hint  the spider droid is flimsy at best making it stand or even move without tumbling over is hard also why the brown cylinders on the legs keep the colourscheme clean please the figs are fine except that i dislike the clone headgear and the fact that the helmets now have holes in the sides allowing the flesh head to show within  goofy looking i am soo replacing the clone heads with black ones great review of an acceptable set aw thats too bad kimt while i must admit it is flimsy i still love this set oh yeah i added the other prices thank you	positive
asuka on aug 30 2008 1037 pm said thank you for that good review jimbutcher i think that this is really a pretty interesting and original looking set maybe it´s not very stable but it owns some special war of the worlds charm for sure yes thats it i couldnt remember what the spider reminded me of but thats it	positive
thanks for the great review jimbutcher this looks like a pretty decent set i might get this if i find it on discount	positive
i love the look of this set its the closest to getting a walking eye from the venture bros as well as the droids and troopers 	positive

this is polar1 over its day 5 at arctic research base 76 we are experiencing radio difficulties since discovering a number of strange radioactive arctic life forms which seem to be effecting our signal over we have encountered a large polar bear which by all account appears to be friendly and playful our food supply however has diminished quickly and we have to venture north from the base to a frozen lake in search of fish our cordinates are currently 46Â°45â²4â³n 741Â°21â²7â³w we do plan to take the snowmobile to the lake after we get our provisions in order this is polar1 out polar explorer bonus pack set  6569 theme arctic year released 2000 piece count 76 minifigs 2 list price 10 usd in 2000 lego introduced a new theme called arctic it was something completely new and different for lego as no minifig scale sets andor adventurers had ever ventured to the arctic the set offered new orange pieces and combined elements of blue and white pieces to provide a number of sleds vehicles a mobile outpost 6520 and even a large polar base 6575 the theme was unfortunately short lived and did not see 2001 this particular set is a value pack that combines sets 6578 polar explorer and 6586 polar scout at a reasonable price of 10 usd i may have even paid a few dollars less at a discount toy store back in the early 2000s a picture of the bonus pack with the two sets combined within the box the backside features an advertisement for the lego club and pictures of other arctic sets starting with the smaller set the polar explorer just a tip of the iceberg  instructions front of box back of box both sets include the same minifig an arctic fig with glasses and a thick arctic coat heres a shot of the fig with his hood on i always thought the hood is a nice piece that would work well for hoth rebel snow scenes the set includes a few nice accessories the set actually creates a small icesnow formation that can even be placed on water to represent an iceberg heres a closeup with the blue ice spider the complete set next the polar scout front of box back of box the polar scout instructions picture the same image as the box but i really like the real arctic imagery on the backside the set includes a small sheet of decals included are some great arctic accessories and some interesting arctic creatures like this neon orange scorpion in a ball of ice i love the polar bear a great addition to snow scenes but the best part of this set is the orange and black sled the back sled attachment uhaul has some tools and a removable storage cover the top comes off easy to store tools and equipment heres the arctic fig with a great metal detector or other snow research device and the sled itself lastly a picture of the complete polar scout final thoughts im a little disappointed that arctic was a shortlived theme at the time i wasnt too interested in the arctic but i still regret not buying the large polar research base after seeing it at a discounted price i was able to pick up this set and the mobile outpost that i never opened id be interesting in reading your thoughts in regard to this set and the arctic theme	neutral
i like the theme very much but sadly i dont own any sets of it it brings such a great feeling its fresh and has great parts and sets and it brought the polar bear your review is very good and informative thanks i voted wrong i meant above average but i clicked below average 	positive
hi great review on one of my favourite themes i never realized how cool it was until just now when you did your review anyways i remember my one set of the arctict expedition the arctic expedition pack	positive
a nice set review as for the theme itself i though it was a very interesting theme sadly i don’t think lego put enough effort into it i was personally upset not to se a second year even if i didn’t buy any of the sets it reminds me of the artic theme playmobil did at one point in the distant past to be honest i think a number of good artic scenes were missed when it came out a really wanted to get a ski plane but it never came i built it myself in the end but i don’t know how lego missed that one on a slightly random note i do know that at least one lego minifig did make it all the way to the real artic with a research team sadly i don’t have any pictures to offer you	negative

thank you very much for this review thebrickster i voted both times for outstanding because i really the arctic theme i only bought the ice sailor but otherwise no sets because of money and place reasons and because i already collect four themes city older castle western and star wars old triology but a comeback of the arctic theme  perhaps as addition to a winter sports and winter rescue theme would be very welcome i really all sets  the little and the big ones in my opinion they all were very well designed not too big vehicles not too little and not minimalitic great minifigs and very nice and lovely details and accessory klausdieter	positive

2872 witch and fireplace review theme fright knights parts 18 figs 1 price unknown bricklink 500 year 1997 brickset peeron brickshelf bricklink ever wanted to turn into a animal wanted to curse your enemy or just wanted to be rich beyond your wildest dreams you should go visit the witch and her fireplace she can brew you up a potion for any occasion or purpose so head down to see the witch right now although this set is from the fright knights theme it can easily fit in with any other castle theme due to the lack of specialised fright knight parts and printings the set comes with no astounding parts but looks like the source for our good magician impulse set from the current castle theme i think i got this as a promo set official pic the box art for the set has the standard fright knight background and lego system logo followed by the set number down the left hand side of the box a cat is attempting a head stand also i think this box display the contents of the set in an attractive set up as usual 1 the whole set minifigs and all here is the witch on the torso there is a spider amulet which is a little hard to make out due to the low res of the image the witches wand is the same as the bellville fairy wands except in trans red like a lightsaber blade although it is completely useful as a lightsaber as you have probably noticed the witch has no legs instead she has a slope brick with the dress pattern printed on witch get it witchwhich looks better than asajj ventress from the new clone wars sets in my opinon for this anyway the fairysaber new word duel this is the old run down fireplace of the witch at the base there are two smouldering coals instead of fire witch its not funny any more is it doesnt make that much sense seeming as it is a fireplace the little triangular brick on top doesnt really do anything i also accidentally put the wrong one on while building it should be a sloping brick here are the coals the old trans orange studs are less translucent than the new ones i like how they have places them above the main baseplate on a 1x2 plate so they are in line with the rest of the fire place other wise it would look wrong here is everything else i havent covered yet the crystal ball the pets and the magical potion vial the crystal ball is identical to the one included with the good wizard impulse form the current castle theme i like the molds for the cat and the bat although if the cat had some yellow printing for the eyes like the white cat had black for the eyes it would be much better i think the trans green tube things are a little uncommon but im not worried about that 2 overall build 610 extremely puzzling and difficult do not attempt alone  its pretty simple but seeming as it has a load of stuff you can move around it is good minifigs 910 i really like the witch and it couldnt have really come with anyone else also it came with the wand which is really good too design 810 it should have come with some fire and maybe some more orange bricks to put at the base parts 810 the minifigure isnt bad nor are the animals or the trans green part price 1010 i am guessing this was pretty good seeming as i think i got this as a promo i gave it 10 because it was free playability 710 as wth all impulse sets there isnt much here but at least it comes with some animals to have a fight with or give the witch rabies overall 810 if it came with some more stuff for the fire place and the cat was more detailed it would have scored higher but because this set can easily be intergrated with other castle sets it got a mighty 8 3 mini comic  hocus pocus magic shocus turn my pets into dinosaurs not to catchy is it poof oh know i think i might drink my magical potion glug glug glug oh my	positive
you already know how i feel about the review as for the set im not entirely sure its a fine witch but youve already gotten her in the witchs windship and a few other sets i vote average on this a good minifig though one does not have the need for more than one witch and some fine additional parts	neutral
this is a very good review no doubt about it about this set this is a cheap way to buy this set with a witch and some nifty accessories such as the black cat in fact i think this is the first time i had ever seen a black cat its simple but not very useful in my collection because other fright knight sets also offer the witches too i dont need many witches overall i feel that this is an average set	neutral
yay another fright knights review odd comic at the end skipper 24 on sep 1 2008 0705 pm said ever wanted to turn into a animal wanted to curse your enemy or just wanted to be rich beyond your wildest dreams you should go visit the witch and her fireplace she can brew you up a potion for any occasion or purpose so head down to see the witch right now sounds like a song or nursery rhyme somehow anyway to the review it is a great review such a small set but youve summed it up well this is one of the few unpromo fright knight sets i didnt get sadly not sadly because of willa the witch i have about four of her but the special cat and the other bits one can never have too many lego bats i voted the set outstanding i think it is for its size kimt on sep 1 2008 0816 pm said you already know how i feel about the review good or bad feelings edited by shoc 02 september 2008  1145 am	positive

huzzah the king has declared a royal tournament pitting the brave knight in his shining armour against the feared skeleton warrior and his shadow horse the jousting arena is set up so let the joust begin 7009 the final joust set info set name 7009 the final joust theme castle released 2007 price usd 799gbp 599eur 795 pieces62 minifigs 2 figs 2 horses price per piece about 13 cents let the games begin box shots the front has an image of the knight and skeleton jousting with lightning in the background the back show the two now fighting with an ax and ball and chain i dont really like the box image as i think the background looks too dark manual the front has the same picture as on the box on the back some of the other 2007 castle sets are displayed this is better than the usual sweepstakes image that we get the pieces nothing really special here but you at least get a good assortment of weapons shields i always like lego shields and these are no exception the patterns are great minifigs first the horses these are great the knights horses coverings are really nice now the minifigs the knight and skeleton both have nice armor the torsos are plain black for the skeleton and bley for the knight the finished product in the middle is the jousting barrier which is simple but serves its purpose on the left we have the weapon rack which is good it would have been nice if tlg had included a rack for the skeleton as well though extra parts only two extra white parts here you can use them if your knights horse wants to retire and look like a normal horse again oh that has to hurt it seems that the skellie has won this round poor knight brickshelf folder now for the ratings price 710 not a very good price per piece ratio however at least 2 figs and 2 horses are included parts 710 the shields and log bricks are nice but most of the others are nothing spectacular design 810 relatively well designed but a bit boring playability 810 you can joust with it and thats about all build 810 short and easy overall 3850 brickset lego sh peeron bricklink strike it seems that the horses have rebelled against their riders summary this set although not amazing is still a very solid set the minifigs are great and so are the horses but the rest of the set kind of feels like an afterthought even with its negative aspects i still recommend it especially if you are a castle fan thanks and happy building ps if you want to see how i made this set a bit more fun check out this click	positive

review of 7670 hailfire droid and spider droid updated theme sw episode ii  clone wars parts 249  figs figs 4 price £2000 2000 ‚2599 year 2008 i think many people were deterred from this set because of the low piece count and a high price for it although it does come with 4 minfigures 1 overall set and figs official box pic this indicates it is a geonosis set from the background but it is no different from any other set same old brown separatist ships the whole set some red tan droids would have been nice like in the geonosian fighter set all the minifigs the super battle droid body is slightly different to the one in the bp it looks more grainy and silver i doubt this has any relevance for it being a geonosis set but i like them better how they were in the bps the super battle droid body dwarfing the commander droids body i think that the new commander droids body is better than the old one with just the yellow strip even though it is less accurate new twisted battle droid arm each droid has one of these i dont really like having droids with these new guns i think the older guns suited them much better 2 hailfire droid hailfire droid by itself it is certainly smaller than the original seeming as this is the main part of the set i was hoping it would be bigger but i dont mind it being this small too much wheels and rockets can fold outwards and inwards the wheels which spin round two large clear discs and made from loads of these tiny links this is probably the best way to make the wheels on this small scale the only other alternatives i can think of are using the tracks from the wookiee attack set or catterpilla tracks both of which wouldnt look right one of the missile pods these use the new flickfire missiles which dont fall out are an excellent idea they should have come with the purple cones like on the magna guards staffs instead of red though because in the film the missiles are purple one of the new flickfire missiles that dont drop out when the model is tilted forward i dont know what the holes in them are for though the 3 eyes are made up of 2 trans red cheese bricks for the sides and 1 trans red stud for the centeryou can also see how the missile pods are attached to the side of the body this is the back of the hailfire droid there is a plate with a hole in i have found only one purpose for this the hailfire droid is the commander droids war chariot what do you use the plate for 3 spider droid the spider droid the design has been greatly improved from the wookiee attack set not only is it more accurate but also more poseable which is useful when setting up battle scenes the ball joint provides the place to put the antenna which isnt long enough but the dome form the old set looks more like the droid form star wars episode ii the eyes are made of a telephone piece with 2 trans red studs on in the original it had orange studs the eyes can be seen in action 2 pics down i told you it was a telephone 1 of 4 identical legs these are very easy to adjust into what ever position you want and are much better than the originals but a word of warning never pull them apart as i did they become very loose when put back together so i put some blue tack in the holes 4overall build 710 a little to repetitive for my liking minifigs 810 4 figs for £20 isnt too bad plus they come with new guns design 910 both vehicles are very well designed but the hailfires small size let the set down parts 810 comes with lots of useful maybe not  brown track links price710 not too bad with 4 figs and loads of little brown links playability 610 not to much on its own overall 710 if it came with some clones and tan red droids it would be better afetr jar jar wiped out a small droid patrold he realized he was being watched mesa in big dodo this time	neutral

i love this battlepack i bought two last time i went to legoland california and it certainly gave the knights a good variety of new troops however i have one complaint and that is the guy with the lance i am wondering why he has a lance while fighting on foot if tlg really wanted to give him a lance they should have given him a horse	positive
great review of a neat way to bulk up your castle guards and their associated weapons and shields i hope we continue to see sets like this in the future they have to be a good money maker for tlg and they always please the fans francis marion on sep 2 2008 1039 am said they should have given him a horse  with that lovely new barding nobody would complain about the price then even if it was 15	positive

the cobra on sep 2 2008 1133 am said  why are the figures already built are todays kids so dumb lets go back to those old minifig packs probably to reduce the sizecomplexity of the package thus saving tlc money i dont see it being a big deal as customization is always an option concerning the set not much to say other than it does what its suppose to do build up ones army of knights the variance of faces and accessories are great i especially love the chrome sword the price isnt bad either since the package comes with five nice figs and some great equipment edited by dj2005 03 september 2008  0646 am	neutral

i think this battle pack is a little expensive but the minifig their heads and weapons and stuff are very very nice but because of the price ill rate it  average 	neutral
i love this set i bought one when i went to the lego store at downtown disney and went home and bought another online i love that it gives you a variety of weapons and figures i like using the bowl helmet guy to man my catapults and crossbows	positive

dear all i found this to be a very usefull army building set at 2 euro per minifig it is relatively cheap in my book so i bought 4 battle packs recently although it could be difficult to integrate all of them in your army personally i reshuffled some of the weapons as to integrate them better but that is a personal preference ofcourse kind regards teddy	neutral
yeah i have to admit you expect it to be wayyy cheaper since a no packaging to pay forbaggies and such b no liscensing feeslike sw so why isnt this set a better deal than sw battlepack dont look at me look at tlche he it rhymed	negative

i bought this set for 214€ yesterday and i have to admit that for that price im veerryy satisfied  i bought it especially for the dog my first one and for the road sign during the construction short of the set i was wondering something does the speed limit has a signification in every country or some variant exists in my country france the speed limit in town is 50 kmh so i understand the road sign in this set but in other country and especially the country were the speed limit is not in kmh does this set had another road sign	positive

i agree that this set is worth the price considering the amount of minifigs and even a skeletal horse it also comes with a lot of blue 1x1 slopes that are always useful and quite rare to obtain another weapon for the soldier operating the catapult or a shield for the other soldier would have been great but that is pushing it the crossbow itself is quite nice and is better than what most 6 sets come with imo overall a good set indeed thank you for the review and the other review concerning the knight of which i hope to buy in the near future as it looks like it comes with a great deal of goodies the weapon rack is useful too	neutral

dark times in lego castle land the poor knight is being held prisoner in the skeletons prison carriage we must help the brave knight on horseback free him at once lets ride 7092 skeletons prison carriage set info set name 7092 skeletons prison carriage theme castle released 2007 price usd 1999gbp 1499eur 1995 pieces 193 minifigs 5 animals 4 price per piece about 10 cents review time box shots our first pic is the front of the box which shows a dark image of the knight attemping to free the prisoner and here is the back showing some features the manual the image on the manual is the same as on the box front random manual shot no piece callouts but the color distinction is not a problem the parts 193 pieces doesnt seem like a lot but many of them are quite large the selection is pretty good lots of greys and black minifigs with this set comes a whopping 5 minifigs which is amazing for a 20 set the knights are very nice and one has a doublesided head the horses adding to the already large minifig count are the 4 horses 3 skeleton horses and 1 great brown horse for the knight extra parts now the finished set first we have the brave knight on his brown stallion the horses head covering looks very nice and the knight gets a nice long pointy stick the main event the prison carriage the design of this is excellent with the bionicle piece and the white horns it looks very spooky the tower this part is one of my favorites it uses white horns to give it a great creepy look one problem is that there is barely enough room for the 2 skeletons the driver here you can see the driver and his whip you can also see the bionicle spine a side view when you look from the side you can see the great design of the prison it is placed on tiles for easy removal and looks great with the round white 1 x 1s on the corners horses harness this is another very well designed portion of the set the harness attaches easily to the horses and to the carriage the prison look at the poor imprisoned knight lets try to free him the back of the prison hinges down the knight is freed everything together all together the set looks fantastic the carriage has a great creepy skeleton feel and getting 9 minifigs is amazing brickshelf folder ratings price 1010 193 pieces and 9 figs is fantastic for 20 parts 910 lots of good large pieces design 1010 captures the spooky skeleton look very well playability 810 its fun to try and free the prisoner and the carriage rolls well build 910 easy but fun minifigs 1010 the sheer amount of figs is great and they look great overall 5660 the future of lego castle summary this is an amazing set for the price a huge amout of minifigs combined with a great design and good playabilty makes the set a winner i would certainly recommend this set to anyone that remotely likes lego sets thanks and happy building	positive
nice review it seems that you really covered all aspects of this fantastic set my favorite part about it is probably the fact that you can give almost every included minifig a mount except for one poor knight  however another part i like is that the horse includes a plain saddle which is a nice relief after the overabundance of the goldplate barding which is nice but overused in the early sets also the sw jokes are hilarious i particularly the running gag with the walker but i like this one too reason for edit i made a mistake due to a loss of internet and an accidental post edited by francis marion 03 september 2008  0332 am	positive
i really like this set and its probably my next purchase from a store if i can still find it theres alot of great pieces i especially like the spiked thingy on the front and it makes a great addition for any skeletal army above all i just love the spinechilling feeling of it if i were a minifig in a legoland id be scared out of my pantspiece if i saw a carriage like that rolling towards me in a dark night	neutral
one of the best sets from the new castle theme we havent seen a carriage in a long long time and it looks so spooky and sceary lots of minifigs new skeleton horses 3 this was the first set i got from the new castle theme outstanding	positive
this was one of the first sets i bought from the new castle theme and i love it so many figs and awesome skeleton horses in just one set at the same time you get quite a few usefull black bricks for castle mocs another perfect set in the new world of castle review added to the index	positive
thats a super review erdbeereis1 as usual and as we can expect from one of the academy teachers i gave the set a 4 above average because i think there are quite some minifigs included for its price which is i think not that expensive at all i also like the parts that are included like the sceleton horses and weapons wheels imho this set is a great armybuilder  btw in belgium i have seen this set being sold for 1599 euros	positive
this was my first set from the new line so im rather partial to it im glad to see it get such high praise its quite the lovely little halloweeny set i wonder if thebrickster could modify this for his ww grave stone mocs hint hint hintedy hint hint  edited by pirates forever 13 june 2009  0202 am	neutral

this set is alright but it doesnt have that pizzaz feeling you know what i mean i would prefered a knights carrage realy but the design is ok	neutral
im a little late in the coming okay a lot  but regardless id applaud you for another fantastic and insightful review erdbeereis out of all the castle sets this one remains one of my favorites i got it for christmas in 2007 before i intended to spend much money on the new castle theme that changed once i managed to get the kings castle siege for a very good price its really a wonderful set all around  the design accomplishes the spooky undead feel very well and it contains a good piece selection and a phenomenal amount of minifigs seriously this set is almost unrivaled in modern lego in the final area  im still amazed at how many minifigures tlc put in the kit i also appreciate that the carriage has a far more realistic horse arangement  after all the sillyness of the onehorse pulled siege engines in kk its good to finally see a carriage pulled by multiple horses again all in all an excellent set and well worth 20 imo	positive
great review erdbeereis1 this really is a fantasic set lets hope lego makes more sets like these with 5 minifigs4 horses at a price of 1999  actually its about rm200 here and its not even pricetopiece count anyways amazing review ad if i could get more castle sets this year i might even join the reviewers academy	positive
great review erdbeereis this is a cool set pics are great love that shot of the lightsabers well done commanderfox	positive
you say in the review its great to get 9 minifigs but there are only 2 minifigs and 3 skeletons	neutral
thanks for the great review this is one of my favorite city kits from 2007 i think its a lot better than the cement mixer from the classic town theme  and it has some cool pieces too	positive
7040 dwarves mine defender theme castle released 2008 price 10 usd pieces 73 3 minifigures introduction here i am with one of the newest castle sets realeased in early 2008 its a small battle wagon with blades on the front probably to demolish rocks in mines but in this case our hero dwarf has to use his machine against the evil trolls who want to destroy his happy kingdom there is only one small booklet for instructions no alternate model parts come in two bags one for small pieces and one for bigger ones apart from the lovely figures the brown parts will be quite useful for any castle builder extra parts are not even worth mentioning there are no stickers figures are detailed enough dwarf is lovely with his beard but his legs wont move because he is short figures are the main attraction for adult players we havent seen castle army builder sets for a long while and this is closest weve got in recent years the dwarf is a little taller than it should have been but its not possible to do so without creating a completely new mould for figures and that would be expensive its beard is oversized as well but that gives him a legoish look which i like a lot the trolls  thats what everybody calls them but i say they are orcs  are obviously evil but they are friendly enough not to scare our munchkins but i wish they had different torsos or at least different faces like crownies there are not enough weapons to arm everyone but the flag pole is really nice unlike the star wars army builders this set has very little weaponry only one sword and one pike creates scarcity for 3 figures  star wars sets had 4 figures for same price so i hope our middle age warriors dont come across any stormtroopers  building in progress when you pull the chain the catapult fires a round brick the set has quite good playability moving blades and firing catapult should be fun for little children i wouldnt expect more functions for such a small sized model it hardly covers my hand the blades move with the front wheel on the right there is only one little downside there is too much friction for the wheel and blades wont move synchronized you may come over this problem by adjusting the blade height and lining them with the wheels mow the little buggers you can adjust the blade height there isnt enough room for the dwarf folder when public httpwwwbrickshelrycgif338578 rating figures 810 dwarf is amazing trolls are great too but i wish they had different faces parts 710 brown slopes are new rest is ok too price 710 acceptable but we have seen sets with more figures for less design 610 it looks kind of steampunkish but could be better with a little detail building 610 not repeating itself still nothing exciting total 3450 castle fans will definetely order this one but average lego player may not be interested conclusion overall its a nice set and id recommend it if you like the castle theme youll find some good use for the figures and this is the cheapest figure set of the year  at 333 usd each it could have more armory and weaponry but otherwise its quite alright skip lunch today and order this little set links brickset reviews bricklink entry peeron inventory	positive
tacitus on sep 4 2008 0957 am said lovely review really but the sad fact is weve seen it before twice httpwwweurobrickshowtopic20293 jeez your comments are getting on my nerves more than one review per set is allowed here thanks for sharing your thoughts on this set with us a great set now has another  great review ill add it to the index as soon as the poll on how the index is to look is over phewlong sentence oh yeah and ill rate this as above average i think it needs at least one minifig more than there is	positive
a great review of a very good set i must echo kimt though i seem to be doing it an awful lot it would be improved by the addition of one more fig to the set as it’s the same price band as last years catapult	positive
nice review i just recently purchased it for our future son and had to break into to it to get a first hand account of the merchandise i am not that big into the castle themebeing a citytown person myself but i must say that this set is awsome	positive
this set pulled me out of my dark ages thanks lego	positive
you chose the perfect set for your first poll simon no question this set is one of the alltimebeauties i rated outstanding of course i never hat the chance to get a complete copy of this set but i do own the engine and quite a bunch of monorail tracks your very detailed review made me think of getting the whole set some day thank you very much for this i never realized there were so many details included to this set the snackbar and the telephone cell and all the other nice things really strange for a nineties set which often lacked details the only thing that comes to my mind right now is that the engine looks quite blocky if the set was released today tlc would use more of those parts which make a better design imo and it would fit better to the curved walls of the stations as well wishful thinkinghow much would i love to see the monorail system back again wishful thinking i had to lough when reading your comment on the minifig seats dont you own many of those i dont know where to put mine	positive
i got this set last month and i can definitely say that even if you think it is one of the best sets ever you wont fully appreciate it until you build it yourself the elevated city station is much more complex than it looks and the whole set is extremely detailed the good  as stated in the review theres a lot of track roughly twice as much as the last monorail made 6991 5 long straights too  the designers didnt need to put in the hamburger stand or the ticket readers but they did and made it even better  great figure selection airport workers as well as civilians the bad if you can call it that in such a great set  hard to incorporate into an existing town if using the default track layout the center loop would be inaccessible to vehicles and the layout is very large  the monorail needs nearly a full straight section on either side of the city station or it will impact the corner of the station and stall if a curve is too close  as far as i know the only town set with road plates that doesnt have a wheeled vehicle a car would have been nice a bus would have been incredible but these small things in no way diminish from the fact that this is one of the best sets ever edited by section8 05 september 2008  0117 pm	positive
this is an outstanding review which deserved to be featured here after seeing this set it prompts me to own this set and match with my 10159 legend city airport its very nice to see such outstanding set being reviewed and presented to our very screens everything about this set is simply outstanding i cant imagine that such incredible set actually released before why dont they ever continue with this anymore sigh its nice to see so much detailed from its shuttle snack bar stairs waiting platform validating machine and etc this is an instant 5 set if given a chance to own a misb set i will defintely seriously consider about it	positive
best set ever i got my copy years ago from a guy on the old rectoyslego newsgroup anybody here still remember that newsgroup i traded him a guarded inn a black falcons fortress and a couple other small castle sets for it no regrets on that trade it is hard to incorporate a monorail into a town especially if you have a bunch of trains too i ended up making my entire monorail system elevated theres just no easy way to make a monorail  road crossing i also gave up on having it run in a loop instead it runs back and forth between two endpoints	positive
yes this is one of the best town sets ever	positive

sets like this just dont come around too often do they i didnt realize exactly how much detail really was in this set tlc should bring back the monorail great review of an amazing classic town set	positive
holodoc on sep 6 2008 0345 am said who was the one who rated it above average i agreed with you who is the person whom rated it above average it will be best to justify why that person felt this way vbbn on sep 6 2008 0511 am said an aweome review of an outstanding set erdbeereis1 on sep 6 2008 0132 pm said great review of an amazing classic town set are the both of you doing grading out of the academy when he is not a student there i cant help it but to notice that both of you placed thumbs up and immediately it struck me with that thought	positive
this remains the definitive city set in my eyes i never managed to get one but from the instructions it seems to be perfect in just about every way i got the two space monorails a while ago but the much higher prices on this one have kept it out my reach this set is a lot bigger than either of those though i always liked the monorail system a bit better than the trains because you could easily incorporate height into the tracks and spread them out in all three dimensions quote edit and bricklink is wrong giving 1991 as the release date youre right it was 1990 it was apparently released in 1990 in europe and 1991 in north america going by some us and german catalogs i have from that time period edited by cp5670 06 september 2008  0606 am	positive

section8 on sep 6 2008 1006 pm said i thought it was out of my price range too then i realized that i had probably spent enough since coming out of my dark ages to buy a misb 6399 so i bought it and i am going to cut back on buying other sets for the next year or so to offset the one big purchase those glimpses of the 2009 sets havent made me regret the cutback that must be one of the biggest expenses legolike buying an misb 6399 congratulations with the purchase though it is a lot of money for one set	neutral
gasp blasphemy someone voted this set below average brings out hunting rifle ahem back on topic i remember wanting this set badly for years and i still want it just no as much because its expensive and as this review proves takes up a lot of room ive already got my trains to think about and i wont be getting this set anytime soon i also have a faint memory of this set being featured in one of legos advertisements more specifically someone narrowly missing it hitches a ride races the monorail to the airport and catches the plane i am yet to find it on the net as old lego adverts are hard to come by especially the european ones now to more important matters starts hunting edited by freddie 07 september 2008  1003 pm	positive

indexed name refuse collection truck set no 6693 theme lego system  town year 1987 pieces 103 minifigs 2 price unknown special parts 4215ap08 yellow panel 1 x 4 x 3 with recycling pattern just occurs in this set 2x 4598 red bracket 2 x 3  2 x 2 occurs only in this set and only one other set this truck was introduced in the same year that lego came up with the garbage bins that of course also appear in this set have you ever wondered why most of the time the streets of lego city are so clean and neat no litter no garbage everywhere no chewinggum on the streets even with so many different inhabitants it seems to always stay that way however the older afols amongst us have experienced totally different situations rubbish everywhere smelly and dirty looking pavements minifigs that were losing their standard grin that is why lego came out with this magnificent truck back in 1987 before that people needed to put there garbage in bags or maybe barrels from that year on every miniman and miniwoman is happily using a trash bin the minifig civil servants never seem to become tired and the garbage truck comes every other day to collect the rubbish and keep the city clean the secret behind the clean lego city and the always happy standard grin of our minifolks are the antilitter warriors that use their powerful machines and handy tools to just get the job done so if you dont own a garbage truck better try to get one before your standard grins also fade and your streets become as dirty as naples where the garbage collectors recently had a strike for quite some time an overview of the set including instructions actually one is included in the set unfortunately i afraid we dont have any boxes of this set left another image of the lego items in the set it shows the truck two civil servants to perform the waste collection duties two garbage bins and a broom and shovel the two chaps that always seem to smile even when the litter that they collect really stinks the accessories that accompany the set a broom and a shovel to help cleaning up in case a dustbin tips over a very nice feature of the set is that the elevator at the back can be lifted in more or less the same way that real garbage trucks do as you can see here the dustbin is emptied through a red train window it seems to be that the hinges of my version will need some revision panels inside the back of the truck maximize waste capacity for this 4 stud wide truck it is nice that the designers added this simple red round brick on a clip presumably it should depict cylinders to let the back compartment tip for emptying or otherwise it might be gastanks again the complete set it is very complete set but some additions could make it even more playable  garbage eg a green flower bottom or some round plates 1 x 1  a place for the second worker to position himself on when the trucks needs to drive to the dumpsite or an other street and also vertical bars for that second worker to hold himself by this is what the truck will look like when dumping the litter at the recycle plant or dump site the whole back nicely tilts so that all the litter will fall out of the truck a view on the back of the truck quite a small but yet effective opening the front of the truck only one seat for just the driver but i personally prefer that to a 6 wide truck that fills the total width of the streets and has problems with corners of course set 7991 the orange garbage truck of last year is also nice we also own some of those but we never put them in our lego town since they take too much room and the color scheme of 6693 is also more preferable to us the two panels with the printed recycling pattern are a bit worn so we might recreate the recycle logo and put it on a sticker some day playability 810 like i mentioned it is too bad that the set doesnt have any litter however lego also saw that and has put litter in the 6693 set design 910 a really nice truck with two minifigs and very nice details price 10 i was not able to get any price information at bricklink one can still obtain a 2nd hand one for about 25 overall 810 a set that should be entitled a classic in the same list as the pizza restaurants the 7750 and the blacksmith shop that was all the pictures i was allowed to take since it seems that those brave man still have quite some trash cans to empty thanks guys for doing the dirty work so our minifigs stay happy and our streets stay clean peeron lugnet brickset bricklink entries additional notes on the review my brother has always been keen on garbage trucks however when he became aware of this truck it wasnt available in the stores anymore newer sets that had the recycling theme we not that good they didnt have the emptying mechanism so after our dark ages one of the first sets we bought were some of those nice refuse collection trucks although the new orange truck has the desired mechanisms and thankfully is a decent garbage truck we more like 4 wide trucks than 6 studs wide trucks so for the years to come our lego town inhabitants will still be seeing this great truck to control their waste problems	positive
this truck is simply beautiful its on my brickset wanted list i love the colour scheme red and yellow are the right choice for this vehicle the back part of the truck can be opened so it can discharge the rubbish like real garbage trucks youve also mentioned that in your review and i find it a wonderful detail thanks for the review jopiek	positive
thanks so much for the great review i love that truck i hadnt realized there was a real 4wide recycle truck out there i must get it one day to replace this abomination currently doing garbage duty in my town i think that truck has seven pieces total in it i do like the blue color though 	positive
great to find this review of a classic set and its far better than any yuk set from 1997 omg what were they thinking  i prefer the six wide for trucks but for the 80s it was perfect and even today still holds its own 	positive
great review and i love the soft yellow effect to the pics imo the most recent garbage truck shouldve used the same piece for lifting the cans into the big bin instead of the droid arms	positive

6206 tie interceptor number of pieces 212 number of minifigs 1 price 1999 usd 1799 eur theme star wars episode vi year released 2006 brickset folder bricklink catalog welcome to my ninth review the boards todays review is the long awaited tie interceptor but does it live up to expectations well lets find out i believe this is the first and only time tlg made this set so lets begin the review the box the box is standard for its time with silver font the background on the front has some planets and the death star ii clarifying that this set is from episode vi overview this set comes with the interceptor model and one fig the interceptor has a very sleek futuristic design with four wings and a ballshaped cockpit the tie interceptor is a stealthy speedy vehicle in the imperial fleet it is used for scouting missions and not meant for attacking due to its weak structure and low arsenal front this version of the tie group is very attractive and coollooking it has an aerodynamic shape giving it looks and speed while not accurate to the movies grey and black colored ties the blue in place of the grey is just fine and does not alter the coolness of the design thankfully there are no stickers in this set cockpit here you can see the ballshaped cockpit be very very careful when opening it its very flimsy and breaks off almost every time fortunately both the windshield and the dish on top are printed and not stickers please dont mind the dust cockpit interior this is the inside of the cockpit it is very roomy airtight and one of the few cockpits in sw sets that are this good it makes up for lack of detail by giving the pilot plenty of room so you should have no trouble there it is also very smooth in the back and where the windshield folds down this is by far the best sw cockpit i have ever seen done by tlg good job the only bad thing is the two tan bricks that clash with the rest of the color wing attachment this is how the wings are attached to the cockpit on each side unfortunately the design on this part is not so good and sometimes the wings break off plus this part is very blocky and there is a big juniorized piece on the base of the wings wings here is what each wing looks like there are three parts on each wing a middle and two fins the wings are very aerodynamic with a diamondlike design note the imperial insignias and the blue tiles lining the wings wing attachments contd here again you see how the middle wing part is attached to the base juniorized piece and the fins attached to the base by hinges the hinges allow the fins to fold in and out a bit but again this is very fragile and the fins often break off gun placements this is an example of four guns on the ship one on the tip of each fin the guns consist of a tile with a tenic tunnel hole on the bottom attached to a technic pin which is attached to a black bar a good design altogether back here you see the rear of the cockpit you can see why the opening mechanism is so flimsy the whole top and front is connected to the body only by a weak hinge system as seen in the picture also note the small transblue dish and the four transred studs minifigure finally here is the single figure that comes in this set a tie pilot it is an all black figure with a life support system decal on the front and a helmet with silver imperial insignias an overall good minifig with a different helmet mold than the stormtrooper or shadowtrooper well i suppose thats about all lets get to the final verdict build 610 a little difficult due the flimsiness of the ship but should only take the average builder no more than 30 minutes playability 710 its fun to fly around   but has no real functions swooshability 710 you can swoosh it around fairly well just be careful not to accidentally break it minifigs 810 a good fig although having only one leaves something more to be desired design 410 very very flimsy with the wings windshield and fins but good for display price 710 i think it was actually 30 usd when i got it but im not sure overall score 65 an average set very delicate so much that you can hardly pick it up but good for display the minifig is okay and having no stickers is good i would recommend this to a hardcore ot fan that wraps it all up please vote your opinion on this set in the poll and ill see you next review edited by jimbutcher 15 september 2008  0310 am	neutral

name jetport fire squad set no 6440 theme lego system  town year 1991 pieces 84 minifigs 2 price usd 2750 which equals about eur 1926€ and gbp 1557£ introduction one of the sets that especially my cousin likes is this one one time at the dutch legoworld event we had three of those there with flashing lights and loud sirens trying to put out the fire that was caused by the crash of again some lego aircraft we never had this set before our drak ages and the sets probably came from ebay or so in my opinion the newest airport rescue is nice too but in the conclusion i will make some additional remarks about that just imagine what it would be like for your lego town if the pilot of one of your smaller planes just couldnt stop before the end of the runway here you see the disaster that happened some day in our town fortunately all passengers got out safely thanks to our brave fire fighters this magnificent truck was used to help putting out the fierce fire caused by the aviation gas from the small plane the set includes two firefighters in distinguishable airport uniforms in order to be able to safe the passengers and go for a quick intervention our brave firemen have an axe for each of them airtanks and a portable fire extinguisher here you see the truck on the right side the large spout on the roof really makes it a remarkable truck as you can see behind the red door there is space for the airtank of our brave firemen at the right there is also place for the small hand held extinguisher the left side of the truck has a water hose instead for a truck from 1991 there is quite some room inside actually both firemen fit inside unfortunately there is only one seat at the back there are two clips for the axes there you can also find the main switch for the light and sound system as you can see the red flashing lights do their job quite well the sirene is just behind the bar with the flashing lights the main spout just seems to begin emitting water the front of the truck for some reason there are two hidden spouts there as well what their purpose is seems unclear but they look nice kimt suggests that it is for foaming the runway and that is a real option of course this set can be found on peeron lugnet brickset bricklink entries playability 810 very nice set details that are movable and of course the light and sound design 810 nice sets with nice details but could have even been better seat for 2nd fireman missing no oxigen masks and only one airtank price 710 for a light and sound set and two firefighters the price is reasonable i would say overall 810 nice sets some details could even be better too bad that there is only a five to choose from a sticker when you have more than one truck last but not least an overview of the complete set including instructions fire mastered as the dutch firefighters will say when they have completed their job we have also bought the newer airport rescue truck 7891 however we think this 6440 one is much better the light and sound all the nice features and the nice details are much better than the new truck edited by jopiek 11 september 2008  1025 am	positive

information name fire control center set no 4953  peeroncom theme lego legoland year 1991 pieces 516 minifigs 4 price usd 8500  gbp unknown  eur unknown bricklink search results brickset lugnet introduction this week i got the flu so since i have to stay home and get better i might as well make a review its one of the most amazing older city sets thus making it a really valuable review this is the story about four handsome firemen living in one of the most amazing city structures out there the 6389 fire control center the box i actually didnt remember the box to be that small borrowed from peeron the four hunky firemen oh jeah what women doesnt like a man in a uniform the manual even the manual is aging but then again its 17 years old review as you all know a city must have some standard civil services like a hospital and a police station a fire house also is a must for any lego city this particular fire house is one of the most amazing sets ever to be released in this cool set you get 4 minifigs all fire fighters two verhicles and a helicopter firefighters have to move around the futuristic fire truck is definately my favourite chiefs car the smallest verhicle of the set its a small allterrain jeep for the fire chief pretty much a standard car in those days a real simple layout and a trunk which holds a small fire hose its lucky to be in this set because it complements the whole thing the car luckily its red and it has de cool signs on the side helicopter another great addition to the whole set is the helicopter again in a basic setup for that kind of verhicle at the time this one has the nice addition of two hoses to put out the fires raging in lego city the chopper no it doesnt really fly really cool fire truck thingy this fire truck is definately the best of the verhicles in this set its actually a futuristic model of fire trucks i havent seen any other fire truck like this i saw a police truck like it though but were talking fire fighters right actually the whole thing han open up to reveal a number of fire fighting appliances such as a hose a computer and a oxygen tank the fire truck click for bigger version the main building actually looks kinda empty when the trucks and chopper are gone however this still is realistic compared to a real fire house also the front has those amazing sliding doors which make this thing really look cool and clean off to fight a fire main structure with the slinding doors pulled down actually those sliding doors are also the hard part of the model since all the bricks must be perfectly aligned or else the doors will stutter but if youre a little familiar with lego then you dont need to worry from the back enough room to play with im going to give my perspectives on each of the sides on the left we have the garage for the bigger fire truck the only real flaw about this set is that this garage isnt long enough for the fire truck this could have been solved by making it two or three studs longer notice the cool sunroof in the middle we have the chiefs office complete with coffee machine a diversity of computers and a tape recorder most likely to tape any incoming calls a lot of details are crammed up in there just like in the rest of the set to the right is the helicopter platform i really like the greyblueyellow of the platform because it doesnt look so red anymore dont get me wrong red is a cool color but not too much red and the helicopter actually fits and stays in place during playtime the baseplate filled up this picture says it all again the four lego hunks are greeting all the ladies the minifigs are from a classic series this happens with more of my lego sets bottom line is that this set is one of the best fire houses lego created verdict the build is pretty easy but takes a while to really see where you are with your building its nice to have a hospital from the same era this create a more uniform look to your city once you completed the model your baseplate is pretty filled up but still has a lot of opportunities playability 1010 cool trucks a chopper and sliding doors nuff said design 910 insanely good design price 1010 couldnt get better than this overall 9610 with a score like that one can only say get one now time to go home the trucks and chopper back on their rightful spots	positive
i have this one the newer 6571 station is better in some ways but i always liked the big airportstyle fire engine in this and the windows covering the garages one mod project i have in mind is to expand the base adding a second room in the area beneath the control center interestingly this set had two different box pictures there was the original 1989 yellow legoland box and a 1991 blue system box and the blue box has the vehicles in different places quote price usd 8500  gbp unknown  eur unknown if this is referring to the original price it wasnt that much 50 is more like it	neutral

big supie on sep 7 2008 0946 pm said i think the 6382 fire station is the better one from the 80ies i agree have that 6382 set for about 27 years now but i have always like that one futuristic truck when i was a child so i also still have some feelings for this set as well crazydance nice review after all	positive
big supie on sep 7 2008 0846 pm said i think the 6382 fire station is the better one from the 80ies i have 6382 and agree that it is a great set it doesnt have a chopper like this set and the fire engine is not as flash it does have a downstairs in the building though at least a door and a front wall anyway its nice to see a review of this set as its one that i often looked at in the catalogue and thought of getting but never did its great to see the details that i otherwise would not have seen i dont like the firemen with hair though they should have helmets or caps imho thanks for the review cheers rog	positive

nice classic set are those hoses around the engine pneumatic tubes that technic catalog looks interesting too i have the catalogs for the next several years but not that one quote this is the model at step five the piston is already attached imagine this state on step 5 in modern sets back then lego had challenging instructions not the step madness like today the most extreme example of this was the engine step in the 8865 set which uses over 120 pieces by itself	neutral

a very nice review jopiek you know i was wondering how lego could justify having two 12vpowered passenger trains at the same time but after reading the review and seeing the lack of figures and accessories i guess i understand why plus the train is rather compact oh and i cant help but think that the chairs in the middle carriage are somewhat oddly placed because those placed next to the door are unusable because the door takes up room needed for figs arms also it appears that your set also has the newer couplers ie theres no hooks for the decoupling rail to grab hold of with the light assembly it really wont matter playwise or if you dont have any decouplers but its still a bit of a bummer	positive
a nice old classic the driver has a nice hat and torso and the train is well designed except for that thing on the roof	positive
jopiek on sep 8 2008 1220 am said the chair was just loose so it should be placed on the 2x2 plate that is also visible in the picture of the middle car btw the front magnet is the old type i have some decouplers but we dont use them because they are not really that reliable lego just release a whole line of trains at the same time i just discussed with my parents and they told be lego had those sets longer in store back then i must have gotten the 7745 somewhere in 1983 or even 1984 although it was released in 1981 i started of with the 7710 push along train and then upgraded the tracks with current rails when i got the 7745 the 7745 was realsed in 1985  lego had 2 12v passengers trains between 1981 and 1984 the 7740  7725 during the 80s the avergae life of a train was about 5 years	neutral

beach cruisers set  6445 theme island xtreme stunts year released 2002 piece count 97 minifigs 2 list price 7 usd during a trip to legoland california in 2002 their big store had a neat little display of some new sets and themes including island xtreme stunts the new theme offered great colors including orange tan and light blue which immediately caught my eye the theme focussed on island fun with some adventure and included some great figs like the brickster i had to buy at least one set choosing truck  stunts trike review coming soon at the time the theme was short lived and many of the sets were on sale at discount toy stores not too long after their initial release i picked up this set 6445 beach cruisers for 333 usd which will be my first of three island xtreme stunt reviews starting with the box a race between the street surfer and skate boarder the back shows some alternate models including a sail boat and jet ski same image on the instructions as the box but the backside shows the island xtreme stunts video game for different platforms the set includes a small decal sheet for the skateboard i love the two figs included within this set one is a hippietype with shades and leafed muscle short and the other pizza boy skateboarder check out the pizza boy on his skateboard two green brackets are included for attaching each fig to the long grey bar using this piece one can make the skateboarder do tricks and flips the street surfer vehicle is pretty nice to the sail is placed on a black bar and lance then attached to the vehicle heres a picture of the vehicle to me it has that old soap box derby look to it  like something kids would create to race down a hill the vehicle doesnt have a steering wheel but rather two levers which i think work well in the cockpit heres the underside the set has three neon orange wheels that attach to technic axle pins to attach to the vehicle lastly the entire set with a few extra pieces final thoughts while island xtreme stunts is not the best citytown subtheme esp for the traditional lego classic town fan it does have some fun sets like this little beach cruiser good figs a skateboard and a very rollable fun word equivalent to swooshable but for vehicles with wheels vehicle you can even blow on the sail to get it to roll across the floor this set is a lot of fun	neutral
great review i would buy the sets but sadly tlc doesnt sell them anymore i have one question only how can you be reviewing at this time at night i would never dream of doing that well i cant wait to see the other reviews	positive
i had never seen these sets before in my retail stores before however i do remember the existence of its video games look like an interesting set for great outdoor enterainment and fun for lego citizens whom is out for real thrill and excitement this theme never really got me excited back then after reading your review its quite useful for some new addition to your town features such as including a skater boy holding the pizza instead of using the pizza van the high fuel cost must have caught up to them to resort using skate board for delivery as for the street surfer vehicle its a cool looking vehicle with unique construction pardon me i have not seen such design before i will actually tear off the wheels cover up the sides and used it for wind surfing thats the whole idea after giving some thoughts and weighs its factors i will have to give it a 3 for this set i will probably get it if its on sales once again brickster this is a lovely review which has showed us a new perspective of island xtreme stunts	neutral
nice review i got this set not long after my ending of the dark ages it was even then already on slae for just 5 euro i like the figs and the vehicles it were some of my first orange pieces the hippie guy is called  snap lockit and the pizza guy is called  pepper roni i think the legodesigners had a cosy evening with much beer when they thought about the names i think this line was the only line which was made first as computergame and after that as a real line instead of the other computergames based on already existing lines	neutral

air chase woosh the bricksters seaplane flies over the beach quickly hippie dude is in close pursuit on his hang glider fuel is running out for the bricksters plane can hippie dude catch him before he either gets away or crash lands in the water you decide with island xtreme stunts air chase set  6735 theme island xtreme stunts year released 2002 piece count 83 minifigs 2 list price 10 usd a nice addition to the island xtreme stunts theme air chase includes two air vehicles a seaplane and hang glider the set has nice island colors inclusing white light blue and orange also includes in the set are some great chrome pieces for the bricksters airplane wings starting with the box you can see hippie dude in close pursuit the back of the box depicts some nice alternate jet skis same front box picture on the instructions and on the backside pictures of the video game air chase includes two nicely detailed figs hippie dude for lack of his official name and the brickster heres a picture of the orange hangglider and the underside unfortunately the hangglider is too heavy to be held up by a minigig while i like the brickbuilt glider for the extra pieces the plastic wing pieces from the ninja theme would have worked effectively and be a lot lighter i think the seaplane is the best part of the set heres a shot of the front end i like the skeletal sharkfish design whats great is none of the pieces use stickers they are all printed including the tail end although the cockpit has no steering wheel or lever piece it does have a very nice printed 1x2 tile the wings of the airplane have hinges to allow them to fold inward slightly also notice the nice chromesilver pieces heres a shot of the underside of the seaplane and lastly the complete set final thoughts air chase is another one of those fun island sets two figs with two vehicles make a perfect combination for creating some dogfights in the air at the same time the bricksters plane can land in the water to explore other adventure play opportunities this set is also a nice addition to the island xtreme stunts truck  stunt trikes 6739 the seaplane can be hauled by the large semitruck included within 6739 hope you enjoy this review	neutral

shoc on sep 9 2008 0555 pm said thanks for the review i loved this theme it had some of the greatest pieces ever arranged in any theme brilliant printed parts and figures and some good colours snap lockitt hippie dude  is a great figure with a cool name i own him from another set but unfortunately not this one it looks like a very good set no stickers and good printed parts too nice review hahaha that made me laugh for some reason i dont know why though i agree with it i have him as well i got him from the orange jetski set	neutral
this is a really nice small set i think it fascinates me that those are actual printed parts thats something we dont see too often anymore the figures are very good although i must say i like the name hippie dude better than snap lockitt does anyone know why the brickster has one blue hand thanks for the great review edited by erdbeereis1 09 september 2008  0645 pm	positive
it is not very often that i rate a legoset poor its the first time actually but in this case i had no other option the idea of this set is good and i like the mostly yellow minifig but the design of both the airplane weird windowpiece a propellor that is way too small minimal skies underneath and a strange colourscheme and the hangglider two handlebars on the wings too many colours makes the set mark the essence of legos downfall during those years i really appreciate the fact that you made a review of this set brickster it made me look into the details of 6735 but i am just as sure today as i was back then i will never buy this anyway thanks for the review the quality of the set may be a disapointment your review certainly is not	negative
i knew this set looked familiar thank you brickster for bringing one of my first lego sets ever back to my memory unfortunately i dont have many of the pieces left but thank you	neutral
hello all eurobricks members and town lovers today i will be doing up a review on glade runner set this is a very small set which is slightly bigger than the current impulse set its part of the race theme which involved in land and sea racers back in the early 1990s i just love these orignal race themes which is produced back then name glade runner theme lego system  town  race year 1993 pieces 29 minifigs 1 price usd325 an image of a 6513 glade runner swamp race shall begins this glade runner is pretty nice looking with its sleek sports look well for a glade runner in the water it certainly looks much impressive somehow i felt that the 6513 is aligned with the 6514 trail ranger i always had that perception that both vehicles are brothers and was released under the same year in fact glade runner was released in 1993 based on peeron information i always felt that this set is used for investigators or police to used for tracking or search purposes in the swamp areas instead of using it for a race i will place this set in the jungle somewhere like bricksters jungle settings although it looks too bright for such serious agenda but i think its pretty useful to use it this way they can rent it from the nearby shop and used it to search it kind of reminded me of the movie us marshals which acted by tommy lee jones and wesley snipes meet the ace please pardon his trousers i did not bleach it earlier it was caused overtime without adequate caring to the minfig look at this great article on how to protect your lego the driver wears a green vest with patch pockets on both sides this is my favourite design during that period it comes with a yellow lifevest too as for the 1x4 printed tile with 3 stars shining in front of the runner its a very nice printed tile that can be used for other racing purposes in other sets as well overall design the built is very simple and yet so realistic making use of the aeroplane tailhead to add as the holder for the rotor is smart the white bricks acting as a platform for both sides to hold the driver to sit onto the centre with the steering wheel at the front i am very happy with this design place the glade runner in front of the fan with a reasonable fan speed you will see the rotor runs like a charm different angles of the vehicle close encounter with the swamp sharks coined by brickster see you later to conclude this is a very nice little set that can provide much fun i dont really used it to race in the waters instead i leave it to my imagination and used it for police investigation purposes such as air crash excerise search and rescue operations and etc i think it can provides quite a fun loving experience although the set might not be very appealing to some people but i find it very fun to play around and is one of my favourite sets in the 1990s where i placed it with my 6514 trail ranger together summary review playability 8510 i leave it to your imagnination design 910 very simple yet realistic design price 1010 a very inexpensive set great way to buy such small sets at a low price overall 8510 glade runner is not common in town and city theme its not a must to have it but if you ever come across it do get it i gave it a 4 based on my review score card what about yours hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine comments and critics are strongly welcomed pictures can be found in my brickshelf when moderated	positive

nice review white fang this really reminds me of an allamerican set with its red white and blue colors and the white stars although i really like the fig with its scruffy bearded face i find the green torso a bit odd for this set i suppose i would expect some sort of redblue racer fig with a whiteblue racing helmet swamp sharks  too funny  you always add a nice addition of humor to your reviews now im going to check out some wonder woman clips on youtube	positive

yeah the name on this set is strange i think all the boxes say garbage truck i guess its up to each builder to decide whether 1x1 round plates are recyclable material or not its a great model in any case i love these highly detailed city trucks weve been getting during the last year or two i used to have a preference for the late 80searly 90s city line but some of these new sets have really surpassed them in detail and functionality	positive
nice truck indeed but the yellow one is better i think at least if you put them on a roadplate it seems to me that those road plates are too small for that also it will not empty completely because of that panel well for the rest it is a nice set and a fine review	positive
i own this set and i think its a really nice truck but there is two little details that i didnt like  1 a recycle truck really needs 2 minifig one to drive one to put the garbage on the back 2 the big hole behind the driver seat it was easy to fill it like this  with hole pouf  no more little hole but this is really a great set anyway 45 for me  above average 	positive
nice review this is a very nice vehicle one of my favorite of the newer city ones jopiek there are two generations of road plate that are wide enough for sixwide vehicles like this the current plates are dark grey with plain white printing and look not great in my opinion the previous ones are imo the best road plates of all time  green with dark grey road white dotted linezebras drain covers and yellow verge markings just like we really have here in ireland for urban area i would still choose the greenedged plates and just cover up the green  the markings are so much better than the current plates	neutral

what a great set and a very nice review erdbeereis i think the only improvement to this set would have been the use of chrome exhaust pipes and front grill i bought this set with a lot of excitement but unfortunately have not put it together yet what are your thoughts on these larger 6stud wide detailed vehicles as opposed to 4stud wide classics heres an image of 6668 recycle truck released in 1992 ps i like the use of taking out sponge bob in your review	positive

thanks for the review this is one of the few city sets that i own despite loving the theme so much most of my town is either custom or classic and its about as beautiful as a big garbage truck can ever be quote nice truck indeed but the yellow one is better i think at least if you put them on a roadplate it seems to me that those road plates are too small for that also it will not empty completely because of that panel well for the rest it is a nice set and a fine review well the truck barely fits onto the old roadplates not on curves though so if you put it in a display it probably wont look bad i think from what i see this and all the other 6 wide vehicles will fit much better on the newer roadplates which are four studs wider than the old ones	positive
that looks like one of those big strange recycle trucks from new york city i like it	positive
i like this set but i cant give it a good grade for playability as the rearmost hinging section is too stiffly hinged so when you open it its likely to break if you hold it just over the shovel and broom my truck thus has that function and with it of course the whole container tipping disabled i also moved the cab a bit forward and the front axle rearward to give the cab the typical garbage truck look as they are often very low slung this also created space behind the cab for some equipment	negative
